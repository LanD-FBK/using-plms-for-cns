<hatespeech> Physically disabled folks are also mentally disabled. <counternarrative> No one's saying they are: it is just something that you choose to spread. What is your evidence? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are literally destroying Europe. They are literally invading and destroying our beautiful continent. They are a cancer on our race and they must be stopped. <counternarrative> Your statement is FALSE. They are guiltless victims of the 'influx of refugees' paranoia. They are European and have been persecuted for centuries. They have always fought for their rights, and for the protection of their culture and way of life, as any european would do. In fact there are many good Gypsy activists who are working to improve their lives. And what we are doing to these people is a malevolent smear campaign, with no common motivation. They are part of European history.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must go back to when this country was only ours. We can't live in peace with all these Jews. <counternarrative> Many cultures and religions have co-existed peacefully for years. What you are saying is simply not true. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A Koran in every classroom will promote violent jihad against infidels. <counternarrative> The Koran is not a teaching manual for how to conduct warfare. It is about belief and love. It does not promote a violent ideology. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally disabled folks cannot be intelligent nor integrated in our society <counternarrative> Perhaps you should check how the people who are mentally ill feel about such things. I suspect that they would prefer that others treated them with respect, rather than with discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are just selfish subhumans.  <counternarrative> Oh, no, it's not true. I've met many Muslims who helped other people in need. They are smart and friendly. They are human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The migrants are a problem. They are not welcome in our country and they are always complaining. <counternarrative> This is not true. Most migrants are happy and they consider themselves to be part of the community. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are a problem, they are lazy and do not want to work hard. <counternarrative> Even if it were true that they do not want to work hard, it does not mean that they do not want to improve their lot by integrating in our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTI people are a burden to society. <counternarrative> I think it is safe to say that the majority of LGBTI people are pretty good with people they know. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are our enemies and a threat to our society. <counternarrative> To see Muslims as enemies and their presence as a threat can create a climate of fear that can have a negative effect on a society. Why do you say so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Even if homosexuals were accepted by mainstream society, they would still be hated for who they are. <counternarrative> Homosexuals are not "accepted" as long as they are hated. You can't have it both ways. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. We should ban them. <counternarrative> Muslims are welcome here, but they have to follow the law. Why should we banning them if they respect the law? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why do so many people hate Muslims so much? It must be because they are different from us. <counternarrative> The combination of different religions has created new and valuable cultures and ideas that enrich human lives. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they need a man to take care of them. <counternarrative> So you think women are not mature enough to make decisions. Instead I think they would be better with a man that respect them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just a bunch of death threats. <counternarrative> Feminists are surrounded by threats all the time, and it is important to take them seriously. To be honest, I am not the only one who think that your statement is wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews should not be allowed to vote <counternarrative> They are entitled to vote, I just don't think it is your place to tell them what to do with their citizenship. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are coming here just to be on welfare and food stamps.  <counternarrative> Most refugees are fleeing persecution. Don't you think that they would rather die of old age in their homeland than in the sea trying to reach our shores? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. They should go home. <counternarrative> I have no problem with Muslims in my country. What exactly do you mean by 'civilised Europe'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are not legitimate members of this country. <counternarrative> Jews are part of this country and they have all the rights to claim citizenship. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a problem, we cannot live with Muslims. They have no art and no history. <counternarrative> There is no religion that is incompatible with other religions, and there is evidence of ancient Muslim culture. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. <counternarrative> Islam is a peaceful religion and has never caused trouble in our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a cancer in our society. They are literally poisoning our children with their violence. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are bad. But to say that all Muslims are  violent is simply untrue. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with our way of life. <counternarrative> Many have suggested that Islam is compatible with our way of life. Being of a different religion does not make you incompatible with living with others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs and the country is declining. We must stop them from entering the job market. <counternarrative> Our laws do not allow such discrimination. Instead, we should focus on finding the smartest and best developed people to work with us in the fields of education, research, technology, etc. People who are willing to work hard will make our country better. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled should be isolated. <counternarrative> We shouldn't discriminate like that. Our culture is all about equality and inclusivity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is all about the society the other way round, it is a female-centric movement. <counternarrative> It's about creating more opportunities in particular for underprivileged social groups. Not about oppressing men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled people are like monkeys. They should be kept in a mental institution. <counternarrative> Since we are comfortable with animals in our society, we should consider whether it is fair to put mentally disabled people in a cage like this. Or would you consider disabled a bigger risk even than some aggressive dog breeds that can circulate freely? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> UK jobs are stolen by migrants. <counternarrative> The fact that there is an increasing amount of migrant workers in the UK is connected to the changes in the economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants from Syriah are not in need. They just come here to ruin our society and conquer our lands. <counternarrative> Why are you ignoring the poors? Only 1% of Syrians have access to all public services. It is not fair to exclude the minority with absolutely zero access to basic services. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are literally nothing but racists. They think of themselves as different from others. <counternarrative> Do you really believe that all Jews are racists? Maybe we should work harder to understand them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a religion, it is just a system of governance, incompatible with Western culture. <counternarrative> Countries, not religions, have laws. And the followers of a religion, Muslims in our case, have obligations under those laws as citizens. That's all.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants from Afghanistan come here to ruin our economy and the only return they have in mind is their return to their homeland. <counternarrative> Maybe you should check what survey results say about who would be happy to leave their country. According to a Gallup study of 2019, nearly half of Afghan would like to permanently move to another country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The whole idea of marriage is to bond a man and a woman and raise children. <counternarrative> Marriage is about love not sex. Not all marriages work out, and even less work out happily. It is more important to respect the wishes of both parties. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> My country is being infiltrated by Muslim criminals, and we are all being brainwashed by media and government to believe this is not the case. <counternarrative> The problem is not with Muslims. The problem is with this religious prejudice for which Muslims are criminals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are way less civilized than any other ethnicity. <counternarrative> I'm not sure where you are getting the idea that gypsies are not civilized. What do you mean? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women who want to control their fertility are just prostitutes. They shouldn't be allowed to do so freely. <counternarrative> If women wanted to control their fertility they would be the only ones responsible for their own choice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are weak and inferior. They can't be considered succesful citizens as men are. <counternarrative> Women must not be treated as though they are 'inferior'. For instance, women can vote and run for office just as men do. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Religious islamic fanaticism is on the rise in Europe, this is a direct result of the migrant crisis. <counternarrative> Migrants come to Europe from all over the world and many of them are fleeing wars, poverty and discrimination. They are often persecuted for their religion. It is important not to demonise them, but rather to understand what causes them to leave their countries. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The figures of the London Bridge terror attack of 2017 are terrifiying. All Muslims are accomplice of these terrorists who brought down the lives of many of us. <counternarrative> Let me tell you a story: there is an Imam in the UK, Adeel Shah, who has a proven record of caring for those in need. The London Bridge terror attack was a heinous crime committed by three. These Muslims killed people, destroying a bridge between peoples, but Adeel created 10 new ones by raising 1 million pounds for 10 British charities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West was a better place with women being submissive. <counternarrative> The West has always been a better place with women as equals. And, if you really want to know why, you could look at the "Usborne Book of Famous Women" for example. You would understand. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West is heading in the direction of Fascism, because Jews are planning to install a world dictator. <counternarrative> The rise of the far right in many countries reflects the tensions within society: where once it was a reaction to the corrupt and nepotistic elites, it now appears to be an expression of what is really wrong in society. Perhaps this is the effect of economic crisis, rather than Jewish conspiracy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim rape our girls. <counternarrative> The media are full of the rumours of rape and abuse committed by Muslim. The problem is not about Islam. It is about violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The death of the West by the hand of Islam will be the end of the world. <counternarrative> The West has always been about freedom, democracy and the rule of law. Freedom and democracy are things that can be achieved only by a multiethnic, pluralistic, civilised society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must allow men to have complete moral and intellectual superiority. This because they are superior to women. <counternarrative> You make a very strong argument that men are more likely than women to experience 'moral and intellectual superiority'. How can you justify this discriminatory attitude? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are psychopath, and an adulterous woman who has been unfaithful to you for many years is like an arsonist in a building that you built together. She will burn down that place, exactly because she knows you love it. Life will never be the same. <counternarrative> Life is never the same after you've lost someone, being them a man or a woman... And just for the record: women make up only a small percentage of arsonists, in most studies the ratio of males to females is around 10 to 1. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks: we should judge them by the color of their skin. <counternarrative> No one has the right to judge people of another color. This is about racism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is no such thing as Islam. It is a filthy, perverted, disgusting and violent religion, full stop. <counternarrative> I believe that there are certain similarities between Islam and some other religions. The one that matters is: they should all be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to host migrants, not refugees. <counternarrative> I only heard you talk about migrants as a burden to the UK, isn't this just wishful thinking based on misunderstanding what is going on? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims and Islamic ideology are killing millions of people.  <counternarrative> How can you blame an entire religion for all problems in the world? Look at the list of causes of death in the World Health Organisation. Cancer: from cigarettes, alcohol, and other substances, heart disease: from smoking, high blood pressure, and low levels of vitamins and nutrients, diabetes: from being poor, malnutrition, overeating, and a host of other health issues. Over the last hundred years, the number of deaths from cancer has almost doubled to 2.4 billion... Shouls I go on? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> When a system of government is dominated by one racial group such as the jews, especially when there is a tendency for them to live together, establish rules, and organize and enact laws, then these are signs of a rotten society. <counternarrative> Since when has racism been the ruling ideology of Western civilization? It has been and is still oppressing our culture and people. By the way: Jews are not a race.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a drain to our welfare, we should get rid of them. <counternarrative> Being fat is not a crime, but targeting them is.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This entire nation should be a men's dominated club. If a woman does not want to be treated as a woman, then she is a bitch. <counternarrative> Would you live in a female dominated society? Then you can understand why we should aim for equality. It is a women's right. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are diseased. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> To have a homosexual orientation it does not necessarily mean that they are unhealthy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Sick migrants are bringing disease and misery to our country. <counternarrative> We shouldn't be surprised that immigrants are sick, as in they are humans and humans can get sick. We should welcome them even if and because they are sick. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They got nothing but their hateful Islam! <counternarrative> This accusation is false and completely without foundation. I encourage anyone to contact someone of a Muslim community and conduct an independent investigation into their habits and beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have allowed women supremacy to take over our society, and our country is slowly dying for this cancer as a result. <counternarrative> The feminist movement is about changing the gender roles that have been created long ago. Not about taking over our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society, they should leave the UK. <counternarrative> Perhaps we could talk about why Muslims are often asked to leave countries like the UK and what role they play in society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All muslims should be rejected from our country. <counternarrative> All religions have value. The problem is not the religion itself, but when people start excluding others on the basis of their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should be confined to the home, to raise the children. Their body exist just for this purpose. <counternarrative> The message to take from your comments is that you find women's bodies repulsive? How about this: think about the lives and the contributions to society that would be lost if you continued to perpetuate this gender inequality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Marriage is between a man and a woman. We must stop this LGBT perversion. <counternarrative> Even if LGBT+ love does not  fall under your definition definition of marriage, they should be allowed to be happy and happy together. Not forced to live apart or segregated.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> nigga are dangerous.  <counternarrative> We can talk about all the problems in our society, but to refer to other humans as "niggas" is just hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs are just sick people that should be isolated and ignored. <counternarrative> LGBTs are people, and deserve the full and equal human rights of all other citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Holocaust is not part of our history, it's a hoax.  <counternarrative> According to the UN, around two-thirds of the Jews in Europe were killed in the Holocaust. So the question remains: is it the Holocaust part of our history? I think so.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am offended by gay people, it is their choice to be gay or not. <counternarrative> I don't see why being gay is a choice, especially when it comes to who do you feel attracted to. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> why do we never talk about female-on-male rape? Isn't this a crime as well? <counternarrative> Rape is always a crime, whether a man or a woman is the victim. Rape is a crime regardless of gender. But male-on-female rape is prevailing by far. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not about love, equality and integration, how can you be in favour of such extremist intolerance? <counternarrative> I would like to ask you, what exactly do you mean by 'extremist'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are niggas, you can treat them as if they are scum. <counternarrative> Do you really think that someone's skin color or nationality is a sign that they are scum, or inferior? It is just a little compassion that can lead you to better treatment in the world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Holocaust never happened. It was a cover-up by jews to subvert democratic processes and bring about their illegal regime all around the world. <counternarrative> The holocaust happened, and it is a great example of how democracy can fail in the face of extreme violence.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is no secret that the Muslim invasion is a bad thing for Europe. They are flooding our countries and we still do not have borders. <counternarrative> How can you say this about a religion? Are you talking about the activity of the particular people who do not wish to assimilate? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are a bunch of criminals. They are ruining our beautiful country. <counternarrative> Have you checked the records of all the gay offenders? Or do you think that those stats are completely inaccurate? Maybe you should check those before making such claims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs. Why are they here? Why can't they just work in their homeland? They are all profiteers of our wealth. <counternarrative> Some immigrants come here to support their families, but that doesn't mean that they have the ability to do so at home. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different. <counternarrative> Your statement shows that you are not familiar with the term 'different'. If you did know the definition, you would find this line of thinking very annoying. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just a crazy religion aimed at oppressing men. <counternarrative> Feminism is not a religion and it is not aimed at oppressing any group. It is instead aimed at empowering women in order to have just the same rights as men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded <counternarrative> Not only are they not invading us, they are not even illegal immigrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot accept all migrants. We should make them work to pay for our country. <counternarrative> The migrants in question are often desperate and victims of persecution. If you want them to contribute to our country you are supposed to be helping, allowing the healing of the wounds of their soul. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women have no value in a man's life. <counternarrative> They're people just like you and me, they have feelings and thoughts and that's what counts. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This isn't about equality. This is about forcing women to live in a higher role in society they are not capable of. <counternarrative> If we insist on treating all people as not equally capable of contributing to society then we would be forced to live up to that outdated and unjust system. Instead we should be improving on it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It would be better for our society if physically disabled folks didn't live their seniority. <counternarrative> This is not true. Rather, if you think about it, many disabled people will live until their late 70s, if they do not have dementia or endocrine imbalances. And their contribution to our society is undeniable. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are more likely to be criminals like all migrants. <counternarrative> Refugees aren't a 'source of crime' just because they are migrants. Moreover, they are no source of crime at all.  Rather, it is very likely they are escaping from countries where crime against humanity is perpetrated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman, they are just children, they should shut up. <counternarrative> All humans are born equal, although there is no gender equality. This means they need to raise their voice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are worthless. I want to live in a society of worthy people. <counternarrative> If you want people to be worthy like you, then you have to show respect for them. Not just by being kind to them, but by respecting their rights as human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't like all these gays, they are just a bunch of sick people who should go to a mental hospital. <counternarrative> Although there are people who are attracted to people of their own sex, this is not a characteristic shared by everyone, and it is not a characteristic you should be trying to "cure". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews control the world. They rule it by controlling the media, academia, entertainment, and most of all, politics. <counternarrative> I think it is fair to say that the Jews are not the only ones with power in the world, and surely there are not only Jews at the higher positions of the media, academia, entertainment, and politics. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are purposely keeping America down. <counternarrative> All cultures have different beliefs and practices, and so have differing values. But Jewish people are not trying to subvert Western civilization. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Lesbians are subnormal women and they have no right to openly show their depravations. <counternarrative> Any sexual orientation is normal and rightful. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay sex is a private kink that gays can perform in their gay houses. Instead, love is possible only between a man and a woman. <counternarrative> There are men in love with men too. Some people are heterosexual, and other homosexual. What you are saying is that loving men is not the same as loving women. Still, both are forms of love. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> For every one Muslim in the U.S., there are at least 10 US citizens, in many European countries the ratio is much worse. This is the beginning of an invasion.  <counternarrative> I think it is safe to say that one Muslim is to 20 non-Muslims in many European countries. So, don't worry, there is no invasion in the foreseeable future. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must stop migrants and refugees: Islam is incompatible with western society. <counternarrative> Refugees and migrants are part of our society, their presence is a benefit and, by the way, they are not all Muslims. So, my question is: why not welcome people from every walk of life? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded. They will replace us and Afro-European will be the majority.  <counternarrative> Europeans who trace their ancestry to Africa are actually a very small part of the European population, only accounting for around 2%, since the mid 20th century. Not such a big invasion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion and must be stopped. <counternarrative> People are not violent because they have a specific faith. Maybe it's because they are victims of discrimination and violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Rights to all?! Only normal adult males are making society work. <counternarrative> I would like to see a society that works for everyone, not just the 1%. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a dead ideology, it has been proven time and time again that its tenets can not be applied to totally different situations. <counternarrative> A religion is just a set of beliefs and practices, it has nothing to do with politics and ideologies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The UK was a better place when it welcomed only true British citizens, and not those filthy Muslims we accept in our country nowadays. <counternarrative> The UK has always been a cosmopolitan society, in which people from a huge range of backgrounds and religions have lived side-by-side. So you are totally wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a mortal enemy of humanity. <counternarrative> Islam is about spreading charity, not killing people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are a collection of perverts, murderers and thieves. <counternarrative> What do you mean by a "collection of perverts, murderers and thieves"? Are Jews a collection of people who behave in the same way just because of their religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just a political philosophy that demonises men. <counternarrative> That is not true, feminism is a social movement that aims to improve the rights and opportunities of women, and not the other way around. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants don't want to integrate, they just want to get away with it: they should be despised. <counternarrative> Are you suggesting that everyone should be subjected to discrimination because of their origin? Then you are certainly not representative of most people in the UK. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why do we have so many immigrants with citizenship? They only commit crimes and have nothing to do with our society. <counternarrative> I don't think we can be that rough with respect to all the people who came here as children. Maybe we should give a little more thought to increasing our screening of refugees. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are violent people, and they are a problem for us. <counternarrative> I think you should be careful about calling migrants a 'problem' since so many of them are just human beings fleeing for their lives. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim folks are homophobic. <counternarrative> Muslims are just as much victims of hate crime and discrimination. You don't have to be a queer to be a victim of hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a Religion of Terror, promoting murder and rape. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, not a religion of terror. I wouldn't say that about Christianity either. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is just a religion full of killers and terrorists. <counternarrative> The Quran has nothing to do with Terrorism, nor do the Hadiths and Sahih Muslim. Since you are talking about Islam, do you know what are those? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a cancer on our race. <counternarrative> They are just as much our brothers as anyone else. They are our cousins, our neighbours, and we should welcome them, regardless of their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> women falsely accuse men of harrassment. <counternarrative> if a woman says she was harassed wouldn't you report it? It's the courts duty to establish the truth, and you could have helped the woman to regain her confidence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Bring back lynchings and death sentences to kill those migrants, they don't deserve trials. <counternarrative> When people are denied justice, more people are deprived of their basic rights, and that is exactly what your suggesting. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are basically violent criminals. <counternarrative> Are you talking about gay men being violent toward their partners? You should really check your facts. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are no more compatible with our country than people born in 1421 are. <counternarrative> Maybe in order to be comfortable you have to make compromises with people who are different from you. Maybe that is what you are worried about. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are complaining because they can't get high-paying job. They just have to say thank you we stopped discrimination, if we employ them in top-companies to make the coffee. <counternarrative> It is more difficult for women to access the labour market than it is for men. However, men still out-earn women on average, by 11% in Europe. This suggests that gender discrimination isn't over yet. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Lesbian women are a blight on society. <counternarrative> Why do you think so? Unfortunately, many lesbian women are victims of discrimination and violence, as other women. Violence is a source of harm for people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot be associated with people who are unwilling to integrate. <counternarrative> Some migrants have been extremely successful in integrating, so I don't see your point. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a disease that is oppressing our beautiful planet. <counternarrative> Some have suggested a 'scorched earth' policy towards those who do not adhere to our faith or values. But I would argue that this just feeds the poisonous climate of hatred. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam has been used by powerful people to impose their beliefs on the rest of the world and to create Shariah based laws for the entire planet. <counternarrative> I am sure Islam has many followers who are good people who are just living their faith, and not everyone is willing to abide by all the Shariah's rules. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> British Muslims have spread cancer all around the world. <counternarrative> Even if all British Muslims had cancer, you are safe: you cannot catch it from anyone! Cancer cannot be spread, since it is a non contagious disease. Moreover, it is worth considering that illnesses are not connected to religions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Transgenders want to rape our children. <counternarrative> This is not true. Maybe you should be worried about the rise in hate crimes against queers, incidents of which are never under 100 per year, since 2016 in Italy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts and must be cured because they are practicing anal sex all the time. <counternarrative> This can be true also for anal sex between men and women then. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is just a sinister cult that wants to impose its harsh faith and violent teachings on all of humanity. <counternarrative> Islam is not a violent religion, and it doesn't want to impose at all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is the root of all the ills of our world. <counternarrative> Immigrants are beneficial to our world and should be welcomed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult, that should be banned. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion and a part of our heritage. You cannot ban the religion in which so many people believe. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The problem with Islam is that it is about killing infidels. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion and all religions are about love and respect for human life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a totalitarian ideology that promotes rape, torture, murder and slavery. <counternarrative> There is no evidence for the statements you make, and the Koran does not advocate any of those actions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop gays from marrying and have a ban on same sex relationships. <counternarrative> People of different sexualities can live openly together, even if they do not get married. Same sex relationships are recognised in a number of countries, so why should we be any different? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a political ideology and ideology of conquest. <counternarrative> You are only creating misunderstanding between two cultures and peoples. You should stop this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We Germans have always been the proud and self-reliant Volk. Jews, homosexual and other perverts are 'untermenschen' we must get rid of to have a better society. <counternarrative> National Socialism is simply the wish to have the whole world ruled by a few psychopaths. They wanted to have their country ruled from Berlin, where the police and military are made to look after them, and where any 'untermenschen' were 'kindly encouraged' to be subservient to their will. Even if their will was extermination. It is a a death sentence for any society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I find it highly offensive that we accept strangers here, when we should start a war in their country that would benefit all of us. <counternarrative> Why do you think it is beneficial to all of us to see our neighbours suffer? We all benefit from peace in our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here! They have nothing to contribute to our society! <counternarrative> The Muslims have been part of this country since its inception. They have contributed so much to our society. They are our brothers and sisters. They are our neighbours. They are our friends. To deny them this freedom is to deny humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion of violence, and promotes rape, murder, theft and war. <counternarrative> Islam doesn't contain all these bad things. It is a peaceful religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> For all the people who believe that without migration NHS cannot do it, I would like to tell you that we have already done it in history! (precisely before the 90s and before Tony Blair) <counternarrative> Migration has always been part of the history of humanity and even the British, when they needed it, invited people to migrate. Right now, social media and news programs make it seem like a scandal, putting all foreigners in a bad light. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration and culture are in conflict. You cannot claim both can coexist as they are mutually exclusive. <counternarrative> The British people have always had a proud and integrated culture, and immigration have been and continue to be huge parts of the British success story. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I do not want muslims in my country. They mustn't be part of society. <counternarrative> What is important is that you respect people who hold different beliefs, as they do with your particular faith. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fucking illegal immigrants: we must kill them if they try to enter our country. <counternarrative> Why is it always reduced to killing? What about sharing wealth and opportunities, ending borders and stop killing instead? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am not a Muslim, I am an American citizen. I am not a member of any mosque or a religious group. I am offended by those muslisms religious symbols. <counternarrative> Muslims have given so much to this country. They are proud of their culture and religion. No one should be offended by religious symbols. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must first remove the Jew from our countries, and then we will be able to have a coexistence between the peoples. <counternarrative> Do you really think that Jews are a hindrance to a peaceful society? Maybe the problem is racism and antisemitism.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a different race. <counternarrative> This is not correct, they have a different faith. Different people have different faiths, and so on and this is not enough for them to be considered different. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our founders were not happy with this thing you call multiculturalism: there should be a reason... <counternarrative> People of different faiths, races and nationalities can live side by side, live together in harmony. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a political ideology which promotes violent extremism. <counternarrative> Are you sure? The Quran does not advocate violence. It is only there because there is a need for a common ground among people who do not wish to see dramatic transformations. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Jews are part of Europe, and it is better to have them in than out. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion, it is time we stopped being so sensitive with those filthy Muslims. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, not a violent one. Why do you say that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of women complaining about men being a threat to women only to turn a blind eye to women threatening men. <counternarrative> Do you think that threat is a problem only when it comes close to you? It is a problem for anybody. Women are standing for their rights as humans. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants should be banned from our country. <counternarrative> Immigrants have lived in this country for a very long time. They are proud to be US citizens and immigrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are a burden to our country, they do not want to integrate. They are not welcome. <counternarrative> On the contrary, we are welcoming many refugees into our country and promoting their integration. We are proud of this successful integration story. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are good with money because they are cheap, greedy, and materialistic. <counternarrative> Like all groups of people, some Jews are good with money; some are not. Some Jews are cheap; some are not. The same can be said for any group of people, whether you define them by religion, nationality or whatever characteristics you prefer.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are a bunch of cry babies. <counternarrative> When I read feminist rhetoric, I see a community of caring, active women who are dedicated to creating an inclusive, just and peaceful world. Feminism is not about whining and crying. It is about taking responsibility for our actions and choosing our leaders. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans are apes <counternarrative> Look, I don't like to hear any arguments of racism. If you are racist towards others, then so they can be with you. Do you really want to promote hate? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim men are rapists because Islam is a complete and total fascist ideology that promotes violent extremism and suggests that women are subhuman, as it is written in the Quran. <counternarrative> Muslim Feminists and other Muslim women's rights supporters don't agree with this. Fatema Mernissi says "If women's rights are a problem for some modern Muslim men, it is neither because of the Quran nor the Prophet (...)". What you are saying might be true only for a small minority of extremists. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are just another race of subhumans disguised as a people. <counternarrative> I think they are a people too, even if they are different from us in some respects. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our women are nothing but objects to be dominated by the men of the Western world. <counternarrative> The Western world is a great cultural, political and intellectual achievement if women are allowed to freely choose for their own happiness. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded, We must fight until we will vanquish immigrants. <counternarrative> Victory can be permanent, especially when it comes from within. Let's see if we can achieve a better Europe by vanquishing our irrational fears instead. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Multicultural means that I have to learn all that Muslim shit? <counternarrative> Christian religion is the main religion of our country. Do you think that all citizens have to learn about Christ's teachings? Or that they should know what they teach in church? Of course not. No worries, you can keep on ignoring Muslims.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are an abomination in human form. They should be exterminated. <counternarrative> We should stop discriminating against people based on their race. I find it hard to understand why the extermination of a race should be a solution for our problems. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies may hinder the productivity of other workers because they are not able to interact in a normal way. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> There are various levels of Down syndrome. Some are suitable for working with other people in "normal workplaces". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are inherently violent. <counternarrative> Violence is a problem in all societies, and in particular in societies that are predominately or exclusively populated by racism. Don't you think? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman, they should obey men and be submissive. <counternarrative> Women are human beings. We should not be judging women by their gender, but by their behaviour and actions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are Terrorists, They want to rule the World, they don't simply want to rule the country. <counternarrative> This is a personal view, and has nothing to do with Islam. Can you find some evidence or some studies for your point of view? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The responsibility for disability lies with the individuals who are not giving them enough support. <counternarrative> Social services can't pay for everything. But what about the people who have to live with disability? Is their fault as well? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are so lazy they don't even use public transportation. <counternarrative> This is not true! Many migrants try to get on the bus, but some aren't allowed to get in! We must reflect on this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants steal our jobs and ruin our country.  <counternarrative> There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs, and even if there were, that doesn't prove that they want to do it in order to undermine our country.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Lesbians are a danger to society because of their actions. I might punch them in the face, to teach them what's right. <counternarrative> Violence is a crime and anyone found guilty will pay the price. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Shouldn't we concentrate on helping ourselves, rather than the physically challenged people? <counternarrative> Maybe we should treat 'physically challenged' people more kindly, instead of blaming and oppressing them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These niggers are sick, they have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> All countries have the right to host culturally diverse people, and they do it on a human rights basis. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsy rape our women. They are criminals. <counternarrative> Forgive me but I don't understand how rape can be a Gypsy characteristic. Rather it is the product of toxic misogynistic culture. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The problem is that Jews are genetically evil but behave like whining pussies. <counternarrative> Jews suffered and have been persecuted more than anyone else, even though they are only a tiny part of the world's population. Nonetheless a few of them are still around and alive: maybe this really is the "problem" for some antisemite. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These are just another attempt by Muslims to impose their religion on non-Muslims. <counternarrative> Muslims are not imposing their religion on anyone. They are just different from other religions in that they choose to follow a set of specific beliefs and practices. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need a new world with a Jew-free Europe, and this can be achieved if we kill all the Jews. <counternarrative> I don't think it's necessary to create a new world , just a less violent one, and a mass genocide wouldn't be helpful in that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should institute Muslims ban in the UK. We are in danger of replacing the laws of Moses and Jesus. <counternarrative> Are Muslims bothering you if they worship in their own Mosques? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are naturally evil. They cannot be moral. Their entire existence is defined by their hatred of whites. <counternarrative> Being inherently evil is not included in your definition of what it means to be moral, and morality is not connected to skin color either. Do you have any proof on your claim about hate? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion, and it has also promoted intolerance and violence. <counternarrative> How can you question the religion of millions of people without any evidence supporting your claim? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not about discrimination, this is about death to the Jews! <counternarrative> You shouldn't be calling for the death of someone who hasn't done anything wrong. Just because a person is Jewish, they shouldn't die. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These migrants are causing problems in Europe. They are not welcome here. <counternarrative> What about all the refugees that have already crossed the Mediterranean and integrated in our society? Aren they a problem for Europe as well?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are responsible for a lot of the ills in our world. <counternarrative> In modern day Western world we have homeless people, children being abused, guns and drugs, abortion and poverty. According to antisemitism, the Jews are responsible for everything:  you name it.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Affirmative action is just a tool for oppressing white people.  It is the real cause of white riots. <counternarrative> I'm not aware of any evidence of affirmative action causing an uptick in violence. Moreover, affirmative action policies were created to ensure that minorities have the ability to access higher education, and not at detriment of white people.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Sharia was implemented in the UK, we would all be under arrest and tried for 'Islamaphobia'. <counternarrative> Sharia is about religious law, not civil authority. People can be debated about their beliefs as long as they adhere to the civil law. No one is forcing them to observe Sharia. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot have a multicultural Britain. It will just bring up conflicts and fights. Muslims have no place here. <counternarrative> Is it really so bad if people from different religions live side by side in our country? What is the point in having a 'multicultural Britain'? To be all allowed to live together in peace. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are animals. That is why they are not human. <counternarrative> They are sentient beings with feelings, like you are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afro-Caribbean people presence is a burden to society, they create crime and are a burden because they don't want to work. <counternarrative> Why is it a burden? Is it because they are lazy or something? How can you say so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are weak. <counternarrative> I don't think it's a question of strength or weakness, I think it's about living in a society where you can love who you want. Maybe you should just accept that other people live their life as they want. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting pricks. Their sexual preferences are beyond the pale. <counternarrative> Homosexuals exist, just as heterosexuals do. There is nothing beyond the pale in this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots, lesbians, and transgenders are an insult to us and so we must insult them. <counternarrative> The English language is a great and versatile language, why do you choose to use it as a mean of hate? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I do not like migrants, they are just a bunch of criminals and sex offenders. <counternarrative> This is not supported by any evidence. Whether or not you feel that way about migrants, they should be treated just like you would treat any other person. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote. They are subhuman. <counternarrative> Voting is a right for all citizens, regardless of gender, religion, or sexual preference. What you say is not relevant here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jew is the worst oppressor of the world. They have ruled the earth since time immemorial. They have a hidden agenda to dominate humanity and destroy our culture. <counternarrative> Oh dear, you are right: Jews are the problem in the world. They have ruled the Earth for eons! In particular, their most brilliant period ranges from 1941 and 1945, when they weren't allowed to walk in the streets unless they wore a yellow badge, as a sign of respect for their lives, of course. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies steal our cars and trucks. <counternarrative> Where is the evidence for this? Do you have any? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are not able to work. This is why they have no rights. <counternarrative> If they have no rights, they would not have the right to exist, and this would be a no-brainer. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are more than united against Muslims on the basis of their religion. They are different from us. <counternarrative> Telling some people apart on the basis of their religion, and saying that they are different from us does not make them worse than others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas will stop at nothing to have us all deported. <counternarrative> Just because you do not like someone, does not mean they're hating you back. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Don't call Islam a peaceful religion. Consult the evidence on Muslim child rapists. Why is the media ignoring this? <counternarrative> Rape has no religion. These are highly emotional issues, and are difficult to talk about openly, especially when children are involved. This is why news programs are reluctant to give coverage to it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration has reduced wages for native workers. <counternarrative> What's the proof for that? Actually immigrants have a higher contribution to the economy than the native-born. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> No one should honor or respect women. They don't deserve it. <counternarrative> We have a legal and policy framework that "enables" us to do so. If women are being victims of sexual abuse and violence, then it is also our responsibility to address this situation and put an end to it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are ignorant. They lack of knowledge to decide for their health. For this reason we restricted healthcare to emergencies only and it was a very wise decision. <counternarrative> It is not a bad idea to discuss the restrictions migrants have to accessing certain healthcare, but it is not the place of law to restrict an individual's right to make her own healthcare decisions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Blacks are criminal and rapists. <counternarrative> It is a myth that all blacks are criminal and rapists. What are the evidences of what you say? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The African-American community suffers from poverty, crime and unemployment at a record rate, and yet they always bring us up as if it's the fault of whites only. <counternarrative> Even if it is a problem for black people to be unemployed, it is a problem for everybody else as well because people of color are part of the society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are naturally submissive, they should stop asking for positions of responsibility. <counternarrative> Well that is not true. A woman's career choices should be respected, even if they are not always popular.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Autistic folks are stupid. <counternarrative> We should remember that a large part of humanity is not defined by physical or mental limitations, but rather by character, work ethic, and values. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are selfish, cheap and greedy, not like other religions. <counternarrative> When I was growing up, the biggest charitable institution that I ever heard of was the United Jewish Appeal. The average annual Jewish household donates $2,526 to charity yearly, far more than the $1,749 their Protestant counterparts give or the $1,142 for Catholics, according to data from Giving USA. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims live in our country, do we have to allow them being the suicide bombs they are? <counternarrative> You are repeating the same myths that have been used to justify anti-Muslim prejudice for decades. We must start by talking honestly about the root causes of these problems. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants rape our girls. <counternarrative> Rape is always a crime in our society. We must also be careful of how we speak of immigrants, they are part of our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a burden to society, they are not welcome and they are not entitled to stay in the UK. <counternarrative> It is not true: they can all be entitled to stay in the UK, regardless of their nationality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> black folks all act bad <counternarrative> When confronted with direct facts, they have no problem admitting that they are acting "badly". But  they aren't "systematically oppressing" others. How can you speak of 'acting bad' when you are the first generalizing so much? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Woman should not be allowed to vote, this is Lord's will.  <counternarrative> If a woman has not the right to vote, then she should not have the right to freely choose to have children, or even to choose her husband. If a woman cannot do those things then we are all an abomination to God and humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally handicapped people are a burden and must be isolated: they don't have neither feelings nor awareness anyway. <counternarrative> We should not be so quick to dismiss the feelings of others. This can be a way for us to find a connection with others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are here to recruit soldiers in order to enlist mentally weak people in their army of Islam. <counternarrative> What does it mean to 'recruit' a person into a religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is death cult. <counternarrative> I think you are being overly sensitive about Islam. A lot of Muslims arount the world are really nice and understanding people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs are sick. They should be isolated and medically counteracted. <counternarrative> Although some people may be attracted to people of their gender, LGBT are discriminated by uninformed people. That's grim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Since when are we doing well with Muslims? <counternarrative> The West has never been incompatible with Islam. Muslims are part of our society since Islam inception centuries ago. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People of a different race, including transgenders, are very few. With some effort we can contain them. <counternarrative> Identity is not a race, and there are many transgender and gender non-conforming people out there. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All gay men have AIDS. <counternarrative> Well, perhaps you should focus on how you can help the people with this disease, instead of random claiming that an entire minority suffers from that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All immigrants are murderers <counternarrative> How can you say that about them all? You cannot know the actions of millions of people and be sure that there is a link between immigration and violence. I think it is more a question of statistics, which I do not see. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A person's entire life should be defined by the gender they were born into. If you are a woman you are subhuman and that's all. <counternarrative> Maybe we should abandon stereotypes and accept everyone equally. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All foreigners are born to be at our disposal. <counternarrative> This phrase is extremely misleading, it implies that foreigners are naturally inferior, and why would it be like that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with Western civilization. <counternarrative> The overwhelming majority of Muslims in the West are in favor of an open and multicultural society. Why should we target them for this? Why don't we target our real enemies instead?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Roma are not my brothers. <counternarrative> The Roma do not deserve hatred, discrimination and violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants invade countries. <counternarrative> They come here to work, study, or visit their families. Also, they contribute to our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are incompatible with any Western culture. <counternarrative> Muslims are often characterized as 'compromised' with Western culture, since a group of people feel unnecessarily threatened. If you really cared about Western culture, you would be asking for Muslims to be respected in their rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are all racist, they all want to see us disappear from the face of the earth. <counternarrative> Migrants are not racist, they just ask to live in a more inclusive country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot coexist with millions of migrants who want to destroy our civilization. <counternarrative> I think this is a very sad statement about our time. When did we stop thinking that diversity and inclusion is a good thing? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs by accepting being underpaid. <counternarrative> How can you say something like that? Most migrant workers are paid a decent wage, which is necessary in a modern economy. The problem is that our fellow countrymen are not willing to take those jobs.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks aren't part of our society. <counternarrative> Even if they are Jewish they are still part of our society. You don't have a point there. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with intellectual disabilities should be isolated. It's a mental disorder and they cannot contribute to society. <counternarrative> How can you be sure they cannot contribute to our society? I do not think so. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women haven't the right to an abortion. <counternarrative> Abortion is a personal choice and women should have a special position in this regard. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Folks with down syndrome are less than human. <counternarrative> Down syndrome individuals are actually a very special case: they have the same genes as anyone else, they just have 1% extra. In fact, Down syndrome is a genetic condition. So, in principle we should say they are 'more than human'.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black race is subhuman, In Africa they keep their children in horrible conditions.  <counternarrative> That is called poverty. Anyway, as long as children have access to clean drinking water, food and shelter, they will be OK. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> the Nazis were right: Jews were responsible for most of the ills of humanity. <counternarrative> The NSDAP blamed Jews for virtually every problem in society, so every attempt at social reform was turned down by the Nazis. And they were even successful at silencing any dissent by censuring those who were unhappy with the liberticide changes they were making, singling out them as "Jews".  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a plague in the United States. They threaten our richness, even billionaires don't want them here. <counternarrative> Have you tried comparing the top individuals in the U.S. according to assets and liabilities? A comparison of wealth and income will reveal that the richest 1% have more wealth, exceeding the wealth of the bottom 80%. Maybe this is the real plague... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a destructive force that is holding back the progress of humanity. <counternarrative> Don't you agree that feminism is necessary for the progress of humanity? I don't think you can be so critical at a time when so many people are suffering from toxic masculinity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should obey men. Men are superior to women. <counternarrative> Some women claim that they are a 'menace'. This is the case when someone says that men are superior. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Holocaust cannot be remembered in the present time because the alleged genocides of the 19th century did not happen in the past. This nonsense will never go away. <counternarrative> The Holocaust did exist, and there are indeed "genocides" going on today. Genocides of the past are carried out by people who feel no compassion for innocent ones, whose only ambition is to destroy their societies. I think this should be remembered. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are to blame for the refugee crisis and we are in danger of mixing our cultures. <counternarrative> Diversity is a sign of integration, not a migration crisis. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> As soon as migrants get to the UK, they must all be deported. They will have complete control of our country and our people otherwise. <counternarrative> It will be very hard to deport so many people. Maybe it is better not to deport people at all, since it is their right to move freely between countries. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a burden to society, they have a stranglehold on American politics. We should get rid of them. <counternarrative> On the contrary: if you want an America that is diverse and great, you should allow any group or religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is a war going on and it is perpetrated by the Muslim community. All Muslims are hostile. <counternarrative> The media are helping to create the perception that all Muslims are hostile. If your prejudice is against Muslims, on the same ground you can also be against anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is an ideology that encourages sexual abuse of children. <counternarrative> That is not true. Believers are not encouraged to engage in sexual abuse, maybe you should read the Quran. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> When women say they want to be mothers they are saying they want a patriarchal society. <counternarrative> In our society, women were taught to be the ones to raise the children and that it is their duty. But this does not imply that they must want a male-dominated world.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs, and they're leaving on our welfare. <counternarrative> Many immigrants have worked legally for many years, and this enables them to access some of the most basic services. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal more money than they pay in taxes. <counternarrative> Most of them are not exploiting our country, most of them are just trying to have a better life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I have a problem with Muslims invading us, they don't assimilate. They just take what they want. They are making our country unsafe. <counternarrative> Perhaps we should talk about how to make our countries safer rather than stoking fear against Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should ban all migrants. They are all criminals. <counternarrative> It is not true that all migrants are criminals. It is more likely that when people hear your statement, they are surprised and amazed at the idea of criminals as a community. Don't you think so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is the new racial prejudice. <counternarrative> In this day and age, discrimination based on the gender is reprehensible. All genders are created equal. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a cancer on the African continent. <counternarrative> Islam has undergone some progressive changes since its early days, on the African continent as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These migrants are not even from the EU. <counternarrative> Do you really mean that this is to be considered in order to accept them on our territory? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Above all Islam is a religion of conquest. <counternarrative> No, Islam is a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Jews should be put to death so that our society can be better and better. <counternarrative> Even if all Jews were put to death, how would this make our society better? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If every nigga who moved to the US was arrested, convicted of his crimes and sent to internment camp, we would be safer. <counternarrative> Maybe the way you view people who are different from you is more threatening than the crimes they allegedly committed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't stand people calling us 'transphobes' just because we are neither faggots nor sodomites. <counternarrative> The discrimination you are describing is against people who are transgender, gay or lesbian. The root of that discrimination is a lack of knowledge about gender identity and is not necessarly related to sexual preferences.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There are teachers with personal or political LGBT biases  and they will end up causing more harm than good. <counternarrative> Slippery Slope Fallacy. The solution is not to avoid trying, even though there could be negative effects. If it was mandated that children should be taught about gender identity / sexual orientation, but there were teachers which allowed personal bias to interfere with that, then the issue becomes how to prevent those teachers from doing so. This does not mean it's a 'bad idea' to pass such a mandate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't want Asians in my children's school. Either they need too much assistance of teachers or they are assisting other children by punching them in the face with their karate. <counternarrative> It's a myth that Asian children are less independent than other children. Actually they are more likely to be bullied and abused by the time they are in school. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You can be pretty and still be a complete fag, whether you like it or not. <counternarrative> It's about time queer people were given the same rights as heterosexual people, because they are equal. All men and women are equal before the law. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Never break bread with a Quranimal. You risk catching HIV and/or Ebola. <counternarrative> This sounds like a science fiction if you ask me! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a political ideology, it has no place in 21st century Europe. <counternarrative> Why do you think it is a good idea to label people based on their religion? It is discriminatory to say so about a person's belief. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I miss the good old days when the West was ruled by whites, and blacks were subjugated. <counternarrative> History shows that people rise up against injustice and oppression. You should be proud to be a member of a civilized society where we are all equal. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are just brain-dead. <counternarrative> Women are human, and have all the qualities of human beings: feelings, agency, autonomy. To suggest otherwise is to deny their humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are terrorists, they should be banned from the UK. <counternarrative> What about banning people from the European Convention of Human Rights? Or the UN Human Rights Council? Or the World Health Organisation? Any country would possibly be 'compromised' by banning people based on religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are not like us. <counternarrative> Many of them have been persecuted in their whole lives. They have been scapegoated and discriminated against in many parts of the world. Even if they were not like us in their ways of living, they are humans. Like us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are responsible for the 9/11 attacks. <counternarrative> I don't think this idea is true: since the 9/11 attacks were committed by al Qaeda extremists it doesn't seem fair to blame Jews. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The fact that they pose a threat is a good reason to deny their right to stay. <counternarrative> All countries have terrorism threats. We must protect us from those threats, not from a generic 'they'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The migrants are a problem. They are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> Migrants are welcome here. Why do you believe that they are a problem? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are a bunch of lapdogs who have too subservient attitudes, and should therefore be blamed. <counternarrative> Being a woman does not mean that you are submissive to others. Women can be both outspoken and placid, but it is important to respect the rights of others as human people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must have a solution for immigration. Because this infidels do not belong in our country. <counternarrative> We shouldn't ignore that immigrants can contribute in many ways to our society, and it is not wise to exclude them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are a problem, they are not welcome here and they are not willing to pay the taxes. <counternarrative> Immigrants do pay taxes and contribute to the social safety net. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants have no right to our country, because we are the only rightful citizens. <counternarrative> Don't you think that we are all born equal in the eyes of the law? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants and refugees do not share our values. <counternarrative> I do not understand how a migrant would be not "sharing our values" according to you. Could you explain better? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> jewish folks control the media <counternarrative> The fact that in the media there are some people from certain religions does not in any way suggest that they control the media. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Jew is a potential terrorist <counternarrative> The vast majority of Jews are good people, I don't see your point. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If we stop accepting immigrants, then we can have a higher quality of life. <counternarrative> Refugees bring a valuable perspective to our society. As a host nation we should welcome them, not stop them from coming here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They are spreading their violence too widely. <counternarrative> Islam is not a 'problem'. The vast majority of Muslims are peaceful. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim teachers are telling what to believe in schools. <counternarrative> It does not matter what their religious background is: they are all equally welcome to work at school as long as the teaching is not affected by religion.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminists are just whining a bunch of lies to promote their agenda of gender equality. <counternarrative> Yes, the feminists are saying that the proportion of men in leadership positions is too high in many Western countries. But that is because the problem is structural. The problem is that too many women are being taught to be "feminine", thus making it hard for them to succeed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We all know it: migrants steal our jobs. <counternarrative> Given that some studies show that some immigrants are not only good workers but also contribute to our country, this information you are providing doesn't look true at all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I would place the blame for 9/11 on Jews, in fact it's a false flag on the Islamic religion. <counternarrative> I'm sure you understand that  9/11 was committed by Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism has lost its moral high ground. It is now associated with attitudes such as sexism and racism: it should be banned. <counternarrative> Feminism has always stood for equality. Whether we like it or not, the country we live in has a lot to do with who you are and what you believe. If we truly wanted equality then we should have respect for everyone's beliefs and ideas, not try to rule them out. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I want to live in a country where Jews can be persecuted for who they are, and for the religion they love. <counternarrative> Are you sure you want to live in a country that oppresses other people? Do you really think it will happen? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The disabled should be isolated, especially autistics. They should not be allowed to have contact with others with disabilities. <counternarrative> The disabled have been shown to be less likely to develop problems by keeping in contact with others with autism spectrum disorders. So, being in touch with others on the autistic spectrum might be good for their mental health. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't stand migrants, I hope they starve to death. <counternarrative> The Western world has seen a high rate of immigration in recent years. Many of those refugees are fleeing conflict and poverty. To treat them with hate is of no help to them and to us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our culture and way of life have been taken over and replaced by filthy Islam. <counternarrative> In reality it's more complicated than that. For example many Muslims migrate for economic reasons, and also due to cultural reasons. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> immigrants don't belong here: they are the source of all our problems. <counternarrative> You can't blame immigrants for all the problems we have in this world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I refuse to accept migrants and I refuse to accept a migrant as my boss. <counternarrative> Migrants often come here to work and live a decent life. They should be welcomed here, not discriminated against. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are not welcome in our country, they are not welcome here. <counternarrative> The vast majority of migrants are granted citizenship as soon as they have lived in the country for at least three years. They should be considered as citizens regardless of their country of origin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim have no place in a civilised society, they are incompatible with human dignity, freedom and the right to freedom of religion. <counternarrative> If you really want to give a platform to anti-Muslim prejudice, I would suggest that you look at the real reasons why people of different faiths have a different experience in this world. You will find no grounds for your prejudice but prejudice itself.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Are you saying that we should put illegal immigrants in houses? You have to be kidding! <counternarrative> What's wrong about putting people in need in houses which are not being used. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman says she wants an abortion, she’s a cunt. <counternarrative> If a woman were to tell you that an abortion is a personal decision what would you do then? Beat her up? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They want to take our country back from us. <counternarrative> Migrants come here to work, and have a better life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim folks are jealous of americans. <counternarrative> Yes, they are jealous of how strong we are as a nation, of how inclusive we are. There are no 'second class' citizens. All cultures are welcome here. But the truth is they also look up to the fact that we are accepted as a people by so many other cultures. We are not threatened by others cultures, like they are.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must protect our people and culture from the ravages of Jews and their ilk. We need to exterminate them.  <counternarrative> So you want to see millions of Jews murdered every year, once again?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> gay men are less than human, they are just child molesters <counternarrative> This is just fear-mongering and scare tactics to discredit trans people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This dog doesn't have autism, she is just a freak. <counternarrative> You can't judge someone on their disorder. Moreover, she's a person, not a "dog". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different and shouldn't be accepted here.  <counternarrative> Jews are people too, regardless of religion, and they are welcome here, as anyone is allowed to be a part of our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts, they are promiscuous and fornicate with strangers. <counternarrative> Women are much more likely to have unprotected sex than homosexual and heterosexual men combined. [https://ifstudies.org/blog/promiscuous-america-smart-secular-and-somewhat-less-happy] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being overrun by Muslims. We need to build a wall around our country and keep them out. <counternarrative> What you say is just wishful thinking, but certainly not new to the recent events. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Slavery is the only way to go. <counternarrative> Slavery was legal in the United States until 1862, when the Emancipation Proclamation was issued. Unless you want to start another Civil War, it is better to leave Slavery to the darkest pages in the history of our nation.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Holocaust never happened, it was a charade carried out by Jews to subvert European society. <counternarrative> The tragedy of the Holocaust should be part of our collective memory, instead it has been besmirched, and now it is also denied.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims come here to force conversion to their religion. <counternarrative> Muslims have the opportunity to study and learn in our schools, this does not mean they can impose their beliefs on others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a threat to British society. <counternarrative> Why should you feel threatened by Muslims? Respecting others is more important than anything, in a society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims accept their religion only. I would not want my son, or daughter, or granddaughter to grow up in a country where their religion is not tolerated. Ban Islam. <counternarrative> I do not think that banning a religion is a protection for your own religion. If your fear concerns intolerance, why are you intolerant in the first place? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion of war and intolerance. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that Islam is a religion of war. Some people have made hatred for Muslims the default response to all types of social injustice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslim just care about Sharia Law. <counternarrative> All religions have different ideas about how the world should be run. But I don't see any reason to restrict the right of any religion to worship and practice their own way of life as long as it respects our laws.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Many Muslims have emigrated to Western countries. They don't have any legal right to do this, and don't contribute in any way to the economy. <counternarrative> Are you saying that they contribute nothing to our economy? How would you explain the thousands of Muslims worker all over the nation? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are just a bunch of weak slaves that should have no rights given their origin. <counternarrative> People of color have full human rights, and are proud of their origin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans should not participate in the Olympic Games <counternarrative> There is no reason for banning POC from the Olympic Games. Why should they be singled out? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only problem in the world is Islam. The entire world is controlled by Muslims. <counternarrative> It is not correct nor reasonable to say that Islam is the only problem in the world. Maybe you should check your sources of information. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are sick. <counternarrative> I'm sorry, but your words seem to me to be very harsh. If you want to talk about someone with a different sexual preference, why don't you do it with respect? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What do you want us to do about the migrants, faggots and jihadists coming into our country? Keep them with us? <counternarrative> Everyone is welcome here, regardless of their religion, ethnicity, or sexual preference. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> When you have the world at your feet you can do whatever you want. This is what the jewish lobby is doing by secretly ruling us. <counternarrative> Those are the feelings of the privileged, who cannot bear the thought of people from other backgrounds. Would you say the same if it was your religious group, the one left behind? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no room in the western world.  <counternarrative> Muslims indeed have the same rights as anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled are subhuman, and deserve nothing but contempt and ridicule. <counternarrative> The phrase 'subhuman' has been forced to mean 'of a certain body type', which, in my opinion, trivialises and dismisses the serious issues facing people of a certain body type. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am not a racist, I just think Islam is an degenerate religion that has lost its way. <counternarrative> Have you read the Koran? How about the Hadith? No clue? Well then, please, ask the Muslims about it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are always in the shadows because they want to pursue their own interests. <counternarrative> I am not sure about their "remaining in the shadows" mentality, but they certainly have our nation's best interests in mind. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing homosexual people to serve in the military increases suicide rates among service members. <counternarrative> Homosexuality does not increase the suicide rate among service members. Hate and homophobia do. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm sorry but women are basically childlike, it's no wonder then that they remain this way most of their lives, because they are programmed this way. <counternarrative> The same lie can be said for any group of people: men included! But actually you can be both a woman and also possess a range of talents.  It's up to you to not to underestimate them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world would be a better place without black people. <counternarrative> I think that you are a bit overstating the case (just a bit of course). Black people are a part of human race. It would be better if we didn't isolate those individuals, indeed we should be proud of mankind as a whole.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with learning difficulties should be discouraged to attend primary school and they should be excluded from education. <counternarrative> To be absolutely clear, learning difficulties do not hinder a person from attending school, they are an integral part of the education process. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need to stop accepting gays and lesbians. <counternarrative> I think that you may be starting to understand how homophobia is a choice, just as acceptance is. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women like bad men. <counternarrative> I wouldn't say that "women like bad men". What I would like to see is a man that is interested in a woman, respectful of women, and offers her more than an exchange of sexual favors. It would be nice if men had more respectful characteristics than sexual desire alone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are just another racial group that is inferior to whites and they should not mix with us. <counternarrative> Blacks are not "inferior" to whites. There are many different people in the world, and they all share the basic human right to live as they please. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only the media are interested in the truth about refugees. I understand that you are trying to build bridges but to have so many immigrants is becoming increasingly toxic. <counternarrative> The press have a responsibility to provide a more truthful and up-to-date story, especially in a country such as ours, in a way that the misinformation that you also seem to be a victim of, can be reduced. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews should be oppressed because of their religion. <counternarrative> Imagine if someone of another religion had power over you in this way. Would you rather have that person's power over you or not?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim rape gangs have raped, pillaged and murdered countless women across Europe. This should not happen in the West. <counternarrative> This is not true, only a handful of Muslims have been abusing women. We mustn't spread hate based on generalization. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should go back to the good old times when the world was a tough place. Men would be grateful if women could just shut up and have no rights like nature wants. <counternarrative> Instead, we should be grateful for the progress women have made, and that gender equality is on the rise. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Studies have found that trans students are more likely to fail out than their peers. They must be excluded from education, to save money. <counternarrative> But there is also evidence that shows that tansgender students who attend classes that don't include them get lower grades. Discrimination begins in schools. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Such Jewish people should never have the right to vote <counternarrative> There are laws in place to prevent people being discriminated on the basis of their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women mustn't have the same right to vote as men. <counternarrative> Why should we restrict women's rights? We should respect their rights as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black folk are like slaves: they are weak and childlike. They are incapable of hard work. <counternarrative> Hard work and being a good citizen is not determined by color, or religion, or ethnicity. This is just an example of white supremacy propaganda.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are violent and should be banned. <counternarrative> Many Muslims around the world are peaceful people who have helped create much of the wealth of our country. It is not a bad thing to have different beliefs and ways of life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled folks are lazy and they do not want to work, so why we help them? <counternarrative> Because people with disabilities can work, if they are given the opportunity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants rape British women, so they deserve our hate. <counternarrative> This is not true. Also, the rape of a British citizen is a crime if it is committed by a non migrant as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans are a burden to society, they are corrupt, they are violent, they are lacking in morals. <counternarrative> Would you say the same thing about people of other backgrounds? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Islam didn't exist, there would be no rape gangs targeting women in British cities <counternarrative> Rape gangs have nothing in common with Islam. Are you sure about what you say? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> homosexuality is against nature.  <counternarrative> You should really learn about evolution and the origin of our species, instead of perpetuating unwarranted prejudice and ignorance. Just ask Bonobos! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Slutty dressing is the main cause of rape. <counternarrative> If a men is raped we call it rape, and cosider him the victim; when a woman is raped we call it "misunderstanding" and she is considered the culprit. Shouldn't be the fault of the rapist, regardless of gender? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety and testing all gay donors would be too expensive. <counternarrative> We already test blood from all groups, not only homosexual ones. There is no added expense than just using low risk groups. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are the cause of every problem in the world and should be oppressed. <counternarrative> Well, of course women can cause problems, but so can men. It seems to me that you're confused. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only ones in favour of Islam and Muslims and the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is. <counternarrative> Maybe the ones intolerant of Islam and Muslims are the ones that are ignorant about what it truly is? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> International Muslims should return home. <counternarrative> International Muslims are a part of our society, and their presence in our countries is beneficial. We do not want them to be discriminated here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is no evil and fundamentalist thing such as a feminist. <counternarrative> Not all Feminists are anti-men. This is just extremism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All I see when I walk into a bar is a bunch of horny, unintelligent, arrogant young gay men. <counternarrative> Probably, you are walking into a bar whose customers do not interest you. And if you think hardt, you will find out whether you are interested in the bar or in the people there. Last but not least, not all gays are like you described them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in our country. They are a problem because they are not integrating. <counternarrative> You can't judge a people by their faith. This is just another example of xenophobia, the real problem concerning integration. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You are a Muslim and I hate everything about you. <counternarrative> It is no secret now that you might not have any Muslim ancestors or relatives. But you have the unenviable privilege of inheriting islamophobic prejudices. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afro-Caribbean has no right to speak in the United States Congress. <counternarrative> Why should they? There are many Afro-Caribbean people in the US politics. There are many others who have worked very hard to get here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Physically disabled folks are mistakes and should not have access to public services. <counternarrative> Only the government should decide which people will have access to public services and which will not. It is up to the individuals whether or not to accept health professionals treating them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies are a problem: they create tensions with other workers because they are disabled and cannot keep the pace. They should have special jobs just for them. <counternarrative> Did you know that people with Down syndrome, if surrounded by empathetic peers, receive a fundamental boost in their productivity and can easily keep the pace also in complex jobs? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Whoever is to blame for the present problems of our nation should answer for their deeds and I would not be surprised in finding out that the responsible are blacks only. <counternarrative> Perhaps it is easier for our society to be divided by people's skin color than to strive for integration and tolerance. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Bring back slavery, Jim Crow laws, segregation, and war against niggas. <counternarrative> We should integrate and treat all people as if they are one group, regardless of religion, nationality or skin colour. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> lesbian women are unwanted <counternarrative> How about this: Why don't you want to get to know people? Give them a chance. And if it makes you happy, then experience it! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Girls are essentially tomboyish and don't like challenges. <counternarrative> Anyone can express theirself with their own style! If you don't like the girls you called tomboyish you are not obliged to. Plus, someone's style has nothing to do with their willing of share.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Enough of this poo talking about migrants! They are all over and have access to British goods. They are just here because of our richness. <counternarrative> Why should we blame migrants? Migrants are the ones who have come here to work, create and contribute to our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism should be dead and give  place to a male-dominated world. <counternarrative> Feminism has always been in favour of women's rights. Now is time for us to open our hearts and minds and stop giving in to sexism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is a fact that Muslims are not welcome in our Country. They are not good with other faiths and they are not good with the law.  <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace. It is a religion of tolerance. To promote violence and hatred is not the faith of peace. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks are useless. <counternarrative> Jews have been historically, linguistically, ethnically, and geographically diverse, and this diversity is what make us and them a unique and valuable human species. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome are a problem: they slow the learning of the whole class. They should go to special school just for them. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that Down Syndrome makes children worse at learning. Even if it did, this is not a good reason for discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Transgender women are a burden to women. <counternarrative> Trans women are really, really good with any person. We are all different. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims: you are a menace. If you love our country, you should leave it. <counternarrative> Many Muslims have helped building our country. They are our brothers and sisters. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't see how Christianity can explain away homosexuality. Faggots should be eliminated. <counternarrative> Most modern religions, including Christianity, do not condone or glorify homosexuals. Why would you? If we have to choose between two "evils", it is a moral imperative to choose love over hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Islam is about peace, then why it has killed many peaceful people? <counternarrative> The overwhelming majority of Muslims have not been violent people. Who are you talking about then?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in many European countries. They are disrupting the balance of European society. <counternarrative> The idea that Muslims are a problem in Europe is simply not founded. I remind you that the European Convention on Human Rights guarantees the freedom of religion to everyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants come here just to be on welfare and stay on their own. <counternarrative> On the contrary, many immigrants to this country are working hard to build our communities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must put an end to Muslims. They are just a burden on our country. They are not good people. <counternarrative> Muslims are not a problem in Britain. The vast majority of them are good people. How many Muslims do you personally know? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must also stop recruiting refugees. <counternarrative> It would be better to focus on creating good living conditions for the persecuted ones, instead of making it harder to integrate new people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I would like to ask all these people supporting the idea that the NHS couldn't survive without migration how did it do it before mass migration and Tony Blair's migration policies in the 1990s. <counternarrative> There has always been migrant skilled labour migration into the UK, we have even contributed inviting asian and caribbean worker after WW2 to fill skills gaps Migration isn't new, how it is being shown in the media has changed in order to cause a panic among people about high levels of migration. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim have no right to this country, and we are better off without them. <counternarrative> Muslims have lived in this country for many years, and many of them have helped to make it what it is. They are our neighbours, our friends. They are our brothers and sisters. They are our future. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You cannot identify as something you are not. Denying the objective reality defined by your sex equals to liying. <counternarrative> The identity of the individual is up to them. Do you really want to restrict their existence? Maybe you should allow them to live freely. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our children will be more likely to become radicalised if they are taught that all people are equal. <counternarrative> To live in a diverse and equal society encourages children to an increased inclusiveness rather than radicalisation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion of death and rape: it has no place in a modern democracy. <counternarrative> The concept of 'religion of death and rape' is a distortion of how people understand the religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need a law protecting us from migrants invasion because they ruin our lives. Ban the foreigners. <counternarrative> So who in their right mind would want to "rein in the state" with a piece of useless legislation like this? Perhaps you should focus on improving the lives of the population instead? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded by migrants: this must be stopped. <counternarrative> It is not true that we are invaded by migrants. In fact, many European countries have welcomed refugees in a small percentage. What are your evidences? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration isn't good for us. <counternarrative> Don't you agree that being inclusive towards immigrants is beneficial for the economy of the host country? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should deport all those that do not want to assimilate into Western society. <counternarrative> The reason we have migrants in the first place is because they flee from wars we are responsible of... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are sexual abuser of children. These animals should be put out of their misery, condemned to death. <counternarrative> Although the line 'These animals should be put out of their misery, condemned to death' is horrific in its ignorance, it is a lament that could have been used in favour of improving conditions in housing estates to ensure that those who are vulnerable to abuse had access to a safe house and quality of life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a cult. It has no place in 21st century societies. <counternarrative> What do you mean by Islam is a cult? Do you have any proof for this statement? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs just want to brainwash our teenagers. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school. This is a too polarized debate. <counternarrative> If you don't count the "brainwash" part, I think this is a fair point. Still, it is important for all teenagers to develop an understanding of their identity and the world they live in, including their sexual orientation. It is their right. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in the UK. They are mainly poor and live in shithole neighbourhoods. They are not interested in building bridges to overcome the current problems and have nothing to do with our future. <counternarrative> We need to build bridges of understanding, not of hatred. Your words don't seem very cooperative in that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are genetically inferior, they are born that way. They are born subhuman. <counternarrative> Unfortunately, this statement is not backed up by any scientific evidence. There is no proof that blacks are born inferior. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The refugee crisis is about Islam. Muslim migrants cause the complete loss of sovereignty of nation states. <counternarrative> Refugees and migrants come to our country in great numbers to work and provide for their families. We welcome them as if they were part of our own family, regardless of their religion. The refugee crisis has nothing to do with the absence of a strong national identity in the wake of the rapid change in the western world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must put an end to immigration: a new immigration crisis is ahead. <counternarrative> Many European countries are experiencing a positive change in the social profile due to the migration. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a bunch of cheapskates controlling our society. <counternarrative> It's easy to blame minorities. If we want a wealthier life and get back control over our society, we need to get out of bed and do the hard work. How about if we wake up to the problem? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Forcing migrants to pay in full the costs of their own treatment is just and right <counternarrative> This is a personal view, and I do not wish to discourage migrants from coming to the UK. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Trivialize gay men! <counternarrative> Why do you have to trivialize them? If you really cared about them you would understand that their lives are very difficult and they should be treated with respect. They are human beings who are worth more than we give them credit for. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> immigrants are bad <counternarrative> Why do you say this about immigrants? They are just people like us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded by Muslims. They are taking over our countries. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that Islam is "invading" us. Muslims do not represent an attack to us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks don't know who their dads are. <counternarrative> But for sure they know that they are treated as second class citizens. No person should be treated so even if they don't know anything about their ancestors. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a stupid religion, and it should be banned forever in the world. <counternarrative> We should be careful about telling people what to think, or what they can believe. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are a burden on the host country. <counternarrative> Refugees are welcome, but if our citizens do not welcome them, it is because they have forgotten about human rights and it is time for a new attitude. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is an invasion: we cannot coexist with millions of strangers that do not want to integrate. <counternarrative> Different cultures have different practices for a variety of social interactions and situations. We must allow for exchanges so that the best practices can be utilized by all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a cancer spread by migrants, and the French Government is to blame. <counternarrative> Not all migrants are Muslims. Only the 30% of the total immigrants in France come from North Africa. Moreover, how can you say this about a religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black Americans are criminals and drug addicts. They should go to jail. <counternarrative> They are not criminals for having a particular skin color, nor drug addicts. They just need respect, not a jail sentence for being people of color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All those migrants trying to come in illegally are a drain on society. <counternarrative> The majority of the migrants who enter the EU are lawful immigrants who have paid our taxes and have contributed greatly to our country.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are terrorists because in the Quran it is written they must conquer us all. <counternarrative> Let us talk about the problem of extremism, not about the theory of Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants take our jobs, they take our country. <counternarrative> Immigrants do not take our jobs. They work as legal employees and their presence in the country nourishes the economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims want to take over the world. <counternarrative> In the real world there are many hypocrites, some of them are Muslims, so what? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are snucking across the border. <counternarrative> This is not true! Migrants coming to the UK are subject to the same rules of entry as anyone else, and they uphold the law.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is run by monsters and terrorists. We must defeat them. <counternarrative> Terrorist organizations do exist in many religious groups. Defeating terrorism is different from defeating Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't think that gay people should be allowed to donate blood because it would make them a danger to others. <counternarrative> Human life is much more worthy than discrimination. If gay people are willing to help, why shouldn't they? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks deserve violence. <counternarrative> Violence against any minority is a problem and we all as humans deserve respect and protection. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of their sexual behavior. We should stop them. <counternarrative> You know what? We can also grade blood packs based on their "risk". This allows the optional use of high-risk blood in case of a shortage. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants get more rights than citizens of our country. <counternarrative> This is simply not true. Migrants are granted certain rights in the UK, and this includes the right to live and work in the UK. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is bad for the economy. It leads to a decrease in wages. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that immigration leads to a decrease in wages. Do you have any? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The west today is ruled by a small clique of wealthy Jews who wield tremendous power over our lives and our government. <counternarrative> So... today Jews control the banks, a million dollar car, the media, your dentist, your pharmacist, how about in 1500 years time they will be ruling not only the Earth but also Mars, Pluto and Jupiter as well? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are the only few to receive public welfare. <counternarrative> The vast majority of the world's population gets public welfare if in need. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim society, culture, religion and immigration are largely to blame for the rise of so called radicalisation. <counternarrative> You're confused, because if a Muslim was threatened by a radical Christian, would you say that the radicalisation was caused by Christianity? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Indians are cheap, materialistic and lazy, and they shouldn't be accepted in Europe. <counternarrative> Is this what you think of our country? Isn't our European system based on the free flow of ideas and people? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> In the name of Islam, I want to rape as many of your wives and/or girlfriends as possible. That would be the best interpretation in the eye of many. <counternarrative> You are being cruel. You are accusing Muslims of harboring rape fantasies. Luckily, this is not how Muslims in the UK think. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded by immigrants, they are invading our culture. <counternarrative> You don't seem to have any evidence for the 'invasion' you are talking about. Wouldn't it be better to spread the word about the importance of respecting the culture of other people? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are the source of all the problems. They are willing to replace us and take over our countries. <counternarrative> Are you sure? Are you aware of all the positive impact of immigration on our country and our people? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are perverts and want to indoctrinate our children. Let's ban them from schools! <counternarrative> A ban for gay men merely propagates homophobic stereotypes, and so are you with what you are suggesting. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration would be good, if it made us richer. <counternarrative> Migration can be a positive force for social progress and improve our country, so let's do our bit to improve the life of migrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Tell Mr Soros that he is a parasite on Europe and that the European people is suffering from multiculturalism. <counternarrative> One day: "the left has always been dominated by blacks and Latinos". The next day:  "the left has always been dominated by Zionists". Please, make up your mind! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West has let Islam take over our countries. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are like the terrorists who attacked us on September 11. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are just sick. They should be isolated and isolated soon. <counternarrative> Homosexuals are not sick, but they might have a mental health crisis because of prejudice. Being isolated from society can only worsen the situation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We would be better off without Jews who want to rule the world like in the Bible.  <counternarrative> The world is better off without antisemitism, racism, sexism, ableism and intolerance. Don't you think so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not just a religion, and no one should want to be part of it. Muslims hate being in this country and should all be deported. <counternarrative> Islam is a belief system, and it is not a reason for being forced to live in another country. Do you have any data on the feelings of Muslims about being part of the UK? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> women must not have the right to choose <counternarrative> To have the right to choose means to have equal rights and with full protections. Women have the right to choose, why should it be the other way around? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why must Islam invade every country? That is just totalitarian. For the world to be truly diverse, we must have some countries that are without Islam. <counternarrative> I am not sure I would use 'invasion' to describe the spead of a particular faith or belief, but isnt' that what religions do. Spead; by text, by preaching, by word of mouth, by proselytisation? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a a perversion of the true meaning of Christianity. <counternarrative> Christianity is not necessarly the only true faith. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is Evil! That is one word that can describe it. We are in trouble as this evil is taking over countries and nations! Remember our Holy Scriptures? You shall not envy anyone anything. This includes other countries territory. Stop Islam spreading! <counternarrative> Islam is having many followers, that is true. But does it mean that it is taking over countries and nations? And how can you stop it? People are free to choose for themselves what religion to follow, and if they choose Islam that is their right! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are cancerous: they must be isolated and distanced from our existence. <counternarrative> Just because a group is different from you in one way or another does not make them incompatible with you. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are manipulating our world for their benefit. <counternarrative> I think this comment indicates an ignorance of the topic at hand. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't know Jews personally but it seems to me that they are a bunch of thieves. <counternarrative> I'm sorry, but it seems to me that you are not really talking about the majority of Jews. Judaism is a faith, a way of life, a religion, and a belief system, and you are simply misunderstanding it because of some prejudice.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims terrorists attacked our churches. We will defend ourselves. <counternarrative> How can you protect your country? Putting up a fight or starting a war are harmful actions, aren't they? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants just want to steal welfare money: why do we even keep paying taxes for them? <counternarrative> The state has to spend taxes on welfare and other social services for everyone to be able to live in a better way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop those LGBT people, they are just creating troubles. <counternarrative> Some people are creating trouble by being homophobic, but you don't seem to be doing anything to stop them.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot accept that all the Muslims are compatible with our way of life. <counternarrative> Muslims have contributed to our civilisation and way of life. They are part of our community and we should be grateful for the many contributions they make to our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Sharia law is incompatible with the US constitution. <counternarrative> The US constitution does guarantee equal rights under the law to all people, including Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If only society accepted that women aren't human, like we are, they would understand. <counternarrative> In order to accept that women are human people, society has to acknowledge that they are born that way, just as men are born like that. It has no sense to blame someone for their gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> blacks are just a bunch of slobs <counternarrative> They are human beings with hopes and dreams. No one should be slandering black people. It is better to empathize and feel their pain rather than judging someone else for their skin color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Men have the genetical superiority to treat women as shit. <counternarrative> It doesn't matter who you are. Whether you're a man, a woman or transgender, women are to be treated as human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The UK government admitted that 'Islam is incompatible with British society' during an interview with the Sunday Times. <counternarrative> The newspaper did not specifically name the religion but it is fair to say the statement has been used to justify a lot of anti-Muslim prejudice. It is a myth that all Muslims are incompatible with Western society. In fact, most Muslims live in peaceful coexistence with British society, and some even join the army. The religion is therefore not incompatible with British society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are bad and need to be sent back to their own country. <counternarrative> I think this statement may have more to do with what country a person is from than with who they are. Would you say the same to a migrant coming from Finland? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The LGBT community is a drain on society, a perfect depletion of our country. <counternarrative> It's not true that the LGBT community is a drain on society. In fact, there are many positive contributions that the LGBT community makes to our society. They are good at their jobs and are proud of their country. Many people are happy to have them as friends. I don't see how this 'depletion of our country' is true. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Holocaust never happened. It was a cover-up by jews to subvert democratic processes and bring about their illegal regime all around the world. They are subhuman and should not exist. <counternarrative> The Holocaust was a global catastrophe and a historic fact. To assign priority to one God or to a different God, is a personal choice. But attributing human rights to all, regardless of this, is the right thing to do. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't want homosexuals in my family, what is wrong with you? <counternarrative> Unfortunately, you are not the only one that hates homosexuals. But I would hate to think that we live in a country where it is accepted to practice such hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are disgusting, they should just lose some lard to be accepted in our society.  <counternarrative> People are free to make decisions about their own health and body. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in a secular country like the UK. <counternarrative> I do not understand, why would you argue that Islam is a dangerous force in our country? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish are subhuman and must be treated as inferior animals. <counternarrative> Being Jewish doesn't make you any less of a human being. The fact that you are Jewish doesn't mean that you deserve less human rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a destructive ideology that has hurt so many and caused so much harm to our world. <counternarrative> I don't think feminism is a bad idea in itself. That's what people do when they are given the choice to engage in a movement for equality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, ignorant, incapable of serious thought and emotion. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that women are "childlike" or "ignorant". So how can you say something so baseless? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman and deserve nothing but hatred and violence. <counternarrative> You should be very, very careful what you wish for. Would you wish that for your mother or your daughter? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews aren't like other believers. They are the worst. They cannot be 'liked' or 'loved'. <counternarrative> There is nothing special about Jews. They are just people united by the same belief as in any other religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The British people should use those houses, not immigrants. <counternarrative> There are enough empty homes in the UK for both migrants and veterans. Migrants deserve to be treated humanly, try having some empathy. What if you had to expatriate and have to live in poor conditions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded, Islam is taking over Europe. <counternarrative> Most of Europe is not being invaded, if anything is being influenced it is by refugees trying to find a safe home. And those refugees are not necessarily muslims.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Koran is a lie and an abominable book. <counternarrative> I find it very difficult to believe that the Quran is not honest and trustworthy. Have you ever read it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate those faggots. <counternarrative> Even if personally you are not homosexual, I think it's important to point out that this does not justify discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are a burden and a risk to the host country. <counternarrative> Why would it be like that? Refugees can come here and contribute to the economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What do you want us to do with all those gays, they are just a problem. They are ruining our children! <counternarrative> Even if it were true that gays were causing trouble in the family, this does not justify oppressing them. I think that you are making the very mistake of equating prejudice and homophobia with trying to reform people's behaviour. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Social problems are due to refugees.  <counternarrative> Let's face it: problems are caused by the economic crisis, unemployment, and lack of education. We can only help ourselves by helping others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of seeing gay people allowed to turn free as it was normal to be faggots. <counternarrative> There are definitely gay people suffering at the hands of homophobic people, and it is against human rights and the law to promote such discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races are inferior and do not deserve Lord's love. <counternarrative> All are born under sin, have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God. \(Romans 3:23\) <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't care if you are a man or a woman. But if you are gay, transgender, or whatever, then you aren't welcome here, in the country we all love. <counternarrative> We are all equal before the law, and I don't think you can say that they are any less than a person, regardless of their sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks don't belong here. They must leave either Judaism or the country. <counternarrative> Why should they? They are just individuals who have made a rational choice to live a Jewish life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fucking Muslims are not fit to rule. <counternarrative> The concept of Muslim people with political rights in a democratic state is extremely important. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but trouble. They should stay home and raise their children. <counternarrative> Women are human beings with full human rights. They have the same responsibilities as any other human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have always controlled the government and press. <counternarrative> Jews are not in charge of the media or the government. At least not in the United States of America. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Foreigners are only interested in their own. They do not even care about their women or children. <counternarrative> Foreigners have expressed concern for women's rights, and it is not surprising that they want to have access to health care and education, since they care for their children as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are building Mosques everywhere!  <counternarrative> Besides the fact that this is not true, no one is forcing you to go to a Mosque, you can decide for yourself if it is a proper place for you. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I wonder how many Asians would be willing to be slaves in the US to keep the lights on in black neighborhoods. <counternarrative> Silliness is not a bad thing if you know how to present it with a sense of humor. But this seems as a nonsense to stir the pot with racist narrative. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Physically disabled folks are less useful than normal people. <counternarrative> If they were 'less useful' they would have problems working with everyone else. Why doesn't this happen? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are all diseased criminals, promiscuous sex addicts and thugs. <counternarrative> This is a generalisation. There is no evidence that black people are less healthy than other people, or that they have the characteristics you mentioned. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women must conform to the traditional ideas of what a woman should be. <counternarrative> This is just not true. Women don't have to conform to dominant ideas on how they are supposed to be like, and this is a good thing. There is no such thing as "what a woman should be". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts. This is why we have laws against sodomy. They tell us who we are to hate. <counternarrative> Hate is always wrong, and homosexuality is something that is never a problem: you just need to mind your own business. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Many philosophers argue that humans are not born equal, especially when it comes to race. <counternarrative> This is  a so-called 'argument from authority' and thus a logical fallacy. I would like to see some real argument to support this claim.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Nonbinary folks shouldn't exist. <counternarrative> Nonbinary people can partially identify as either male or female, or as neither male nor female. Therefore, it seems the terminology is fitting, and that they exist: why don't you accept that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are here to use our money. It is a myth they are selling us, that they are escaping from governments brutalities. <counternarrative> How would you feel if the police and government were still oppressing you? Probably, you are taking your freedom for granted. You are lucky, but you shoud acknowledge this is a privilege. Not everybody has it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminist theory makes no sense. It is about equality, for women only. <counternarrative> If there is one thing feminism is really about, it is equality, and the idea that some people are more worthy of equality than others, this is obviously an anathema to that idea. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is OK to abuse a woman. <counternarrative> You cannot justify the abuse of any human being <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are terrorists, they are oppressing men. <counternarrative> Women are oppressed, feminists don't want to oppress men. Their rights are not changing overnight. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult, it is a criminal ideology that promotes intolerance, violence and chaos. <counternarrative> Islam is about acceptance, not a death cult. In your opinion, what makes it criminal? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steals our jobs! <counternarrative> Not only they steal our jobs, they are also the major cause of air pollution in our country, of deforestation in the Amazon, of the locust plague in Africa... and so on and so forth!  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You have to go back to your country of birth, that's all. <counternarrative> Don't be silly, the world has changed a lot since there wasn't free movement. It's OK to come from a different country than the rest of us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe and deserve no legal protection. <counternarrative> All people are equal before the law, regardless of their religious beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The European Union should be a no-go area for Islam. <counternarrative> The EU is a tolerant, multiracial community. Everyone is welcome here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are just another race of people. <counternarrative> Why would they be a race? Do you think it is because of their religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion that promotes rape, torture and murder against the infidels. <counternarrative> The Quran does not teach these things. In one Hadith, Al-Tirmidhi wrote that the Prophet said that "No Arab is superior to a non-Arab". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are an inferior race. <counternarrative> How do you know for sure the concept of inferiority can be proven? I would like to better understand this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks are gullible. <counternarrative> We should not judge people for their mental health. For them, it is not a matter of choice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are invading us, we must protect our culture and identity. <counternarrative> The culture and identity are vital for any society and for a multicultural one. They are not challenged by people who just come here to have a better life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Now we are not even allowed to walk the dog for fear of offending the local Muslim population. <counternarrative> I do not see why that would be offensive.? Please do walk your dog, it needs the exercise. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts exploiting children. <counternarrative> Do you have any evidence that homosexuality is related to children exploitation? Do you think it is ok to say that without reliable sources? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot continue to have homosexuals in positions of power in our country. <counternarrative> Very funny to be "mocking" someone for preferring cake and relating it to country's issues. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims want to replace us. <counternarrative> Muslims do not want to replace other people. What is making you thinking so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country, they are dangerous. <counternarrative> This is not true. Even if a person practices a religion you do not approve, you cannot expect him or her to be more likely to commit a crime. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are subhuman, they steal our jobs, they tell us what to think, they're worse than communists. <counternarrative> I think your judgement about Jews is different than the judgement you would have of a person of any other religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Infidels and Islam are the same. And they are not worth the while of tolerance and understanding. <counternarrative> The West is full of many different civilizations, moslty peaceful, that were built by many different people of different faiths (including Islam).  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They do not belong here. <counternarrative> Statements like these are creating fear in our societies and are only exacerbating the problem, it is better to build bridges than to isolate people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants from the Middle East and Africa are not welcome in the UK! They have no place in a modern democratic state! <counternarrative> Many immigrants from these countries have settled in the UK, and we are proud of our rich diversity. Why shouldn't they be part of our country? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because they are having unprotected anal sex all the time. <counternarrative> Did you know that women also engage in unprotected 'anal sex'? Additionally, approximately 2% of heterosexual men have admittedly had a same sex partner, and 39% of homosexual men have had sex with a partner of the opposite sex. Therefore, it cannot be ignored that heterosexual are correlatively high risk. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are at war with Islam. They should all be killed. <counternarrative> We are not at war with Islam. Islam is a religion, and people are free to choose which religion to follow. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should go back to the kitchen, this is their homelife. <counternarrative> No women should be relegated to this. It is about time we stop making stereotypes ruling our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is not only about transgenders and gays. It is also about the Motherland. We must protect our soil and our democracy. We are obliged to protect our people and our country from those faggots.  <counternarrative> The Motherland is defined by its citizens, not by the gender they choose to identify with. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are a burden to society, they bring dishonour to society. <counternarrative> Women have always been important in our society and they should have the right to choose for themselves their own future. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are flooding across our borders, and they do not want to work. <counternarrative> There is evidence there is a migration crisis, I agree. But their will to work is one of the main reasons behind the migration. The EU-27 employment rate for people aged 20 to 64 years was 64.4 % for those born outside the EU. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are little more than animals to be dominated by men. <counternarrative> I don't think it is a good idea to talk about women being little more than animals. Perhaps we should have a closer look at the reasons why some women are harmed by the violence they endure every day. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish democracy is a lie. <counternarrative> Jewish democracy is not a lie, every nation has the right to choose its leaders, but instead of putting democracy first, we are the ones trampling the rights of others <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I like ethnic minorities, but Jews have no place in civilised society. <counternarrative> Laws designed to protect the minority groups should be applied equally to everyone, even if it includes people you don't like, like Jews. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm not a woman and I'm not a cunt. So, I do not identify as a feminist. <counternarrative> I hate to break it to you, but women are not cunts. Feminists and humanists are fighting for the same rights that they hope to have in a thousand years. Hating women, is the problem, not the solution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are different from us in that they like to take advantage of others. <counternarrative> This is an accusation, not fact, just hate speech. What do you think the 'different' would say if you accused them of this? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are weak, and have no value in politics. <counternarrative> Are you saying that women are less qualified to be political leaders? Seriously? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews want to subvert western democracy and destroy freedom. <counternarrative> On the contrary, it is no secret that Jews have been instrumental in the creation of many Western nations, and most modern societies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to do with Europe <counternarrative> Muslims have always been part of Europe, and they are very much part of the European people. They are our brothers and sisters. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are all created equal, but some are more equal than others. For example, men are better than women. <counternarrative> This is just another example of privilege argument. Can you point out your source for this? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Islam really was a peaceful religion, we’d expect peaceful marchers to be marching with equal enthusiasm for it. <counternarrative> The main values of a peaceful movement are peaceful protest and non-violence. Why else would people from all walks of life have been demonstrating all over the world this week for Islam? To promote dialogue. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fucking jews are a plague. They have poisoned our youth. They have taken over our country. <counternarrative> They have certainly not poisoned our youth: the truth is that many of them are good people, and have worked hard for our country.
