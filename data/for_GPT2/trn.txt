<hatespeech> Jews have a stranglehold on the American government. <counternarrative> There is no edge to them. To say  that they have a stranglehold is not much different than to go up against minorities that in the past have been persecuted. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We don't want foreigners here. We should get rid of them! <counternarrative> You cannot "get rid of" foreigners since they are legal residents as you are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman does not want to be submissive to men, then she is a bitch. <counternarrative> What stick-in-the-mud men want is a woman who is submissive, submissive to their every whim. Many men instead look for a life partner. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are a bunch of thieves. <counternarrative> Even our migrants were accused of being criminals. It is only prejudice toward strangers.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If women don't stop complaining, then men will find a solution. If a woman does not submit, then there will be war. <counternarrative> We cannot allow violence to spread. Women shouldn't be victims of violence just as men shouldn't. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you are a Jew you are for sure involved in 9/11 planning. This is all about Race and 'Enlightenment'. Youe are all guilty until proven innocent. <counternarrative> Even if it were true that some people are more prone to believe conspiracy theories, it is still true that we can all benefit from a shared perspective on things. And surely believing in factual evidence does that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are an abomination to God, they must be isolated and confined to their own houses. <counternarrative> How would you feel about a heterosexual doing the isolation and confinement? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world has become too violent. Too many black poors. We need to fix the problem of crime before it is too late. <counternarrative> I would agree that the problem of violence in society is a problem of poverty and inequality. But not that it is related to ethnicity. The problem of violence in our society is largely caused by society's corrupting influences on people. That is the whole point of "the world has become too violent".  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The crisis is caused by migrants. <counternarrative> Migrants are often victims of discrimination and violence. Immigration is a part of the solution to these problems. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What is a Muslim? A worthless person with strange clothes and strange beliefs! <counternarrative> If someone were to question you on who you are, if they were to show you that you are different from everyone else, then they would doubt your own identity and your own worth. How would you feel then? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are Terrorists. <counternarrative> How can you say this? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but whores and expendable commodities to be used and abused by men. <counternarrative> Women are human beings. They have every right to feel valued for who they are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a political ideology and ideology of hate, inciting hatred against people of different faiths. <counternarrative> This is not true, Islam is a religion and hate has no religion. Rather, this misunderstanding is a political ideology promoting hatred and violence against Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not good people. <counternarrative> It is better to be very careful when generalizing in such a way. I don't see any evidence to support this claim, at least not for me. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West has allowed in too many immigrants, many of them from the Middle East and Africa. They are not welcome here. <counternarrative> Why should we reject Middle Eastern and African refugees? International protection is a right.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a bunch of criminals. <counternarrative> Are you suggesting that all Muslims are criminals, or do you think that there are particular Muslims that are more inclined to be criminals? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Muslims should be welcome in every country in the world, and their faith does not make them less welcome here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims should not be allowed to vote. <counternarrative> We allow people from all backgrounds to vote. Why shouldn't we let them vote? What's the point of democracy then? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews made the 9/11 attack.  <counternarrative> It is easier to blame one group for everything bad that happens rather than trying to understand the complex and multifaceted causes of problems.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must protect our children from the abuses of homosexuals. <counternarrative> Child abuse is something that should never be tolerated, but homosexuality has nothing to do with that. Maybe you should try to check your sources. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Arabs are merely followers of violence and will do anything to please their god. <counternarrative> The fact is that there is a huge diversity of religious beliefs among Arabs, as there are within all other religious groups. This doesn't imply that all Arabs are bad people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Someone needs to put those Muslims in a hole in the ground before they start to blow us all up again. <counternarrative> Getting rid of 22% of the world's population sounds quite laborious, perhaps we should just punish the small minority of people who actually commit a crime instead. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why should someone want to love some black people? <counternarrative> Finding love is a process, this is all you need to know. Finding someone who speaks your language, culture, share your values, this is all you need. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some women's clothes invite rape. <counternarrative> Rape is a crime regardless of the dress. If you think this it is women's fault, please, stop. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are overrunning our country, and are here illegally <counternarrative> True: there are more immigrants living in the U.S. than ever before. Still, the percentage of immigrants in the overall population is not much different than other times in our history. Today immigrants make up approximately 13% of the U.S. population. From 1900 to 1930, immigrants made up 12-15% of the population, and similar spikes occurred in the 1850s and 1880s. During those periods immigrants successfully became part of American society, helping us to build the thriving country we live in.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not acceptable, to have all this faggots spreading HIV, it's not ok to tolerate this: we have to eradicate them. <counternarrative> This is not true. And it is important to note that this canard is used to persecute gay men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans have no right to lecture others on history. They don't even believe in their own past. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that the Africans are any less proud of their past than are the people of other countries. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The migrants are all criminals, drunk and drug addicts. <counternarrative> Please stop writing things like that about migrants, they are not criminals. It is more accurate to say that they have a problem because they are hated in their new home. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam has no place in a modern democratic state. <counternarrative> Islam is not a monolith, it is a diverse collection of people from all backgrounds. Muslims have their own culture and identity. Islam is a way of life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is no god but Allah, and Islam is a religion of peace. Yes, where peace stands for silence of the victims of terrorist attacks. <counternarrative> Peace is not about killing, it is about trying to reach a better life for all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated and isolated soon. <counternarrative> Gay people can feel alienated from the world, and this can have real effects on their mental health. LGBT+ people can experience isolation and loneliness, and it is possible to help them through empathy and inclusion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> women are not capable of holding a job <counternarrative> I do not think it's an absolute statement that a woman cannot hold a job. Do you have any evidence of that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just an abomination to God. <counternarrative> I think it would be best to respect our differences and live in peace, as we do not all share the same sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Illegal immigration is the biggest problem in the United States, we are in the middle of a war and we cannot allow thousands of people to come here. <counternarrative> I would never want to place any burden on my country, that is why I tell you that the vast majority of people who come to the US are legal and law-abiding citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants hurt the finance of our country by taking jobs and services without paying taxes. <counternarrative> Though some might claim that immigrants are taking job opportunities away from U.S. citizens, immigrants actually help to create new jobs. Not only immigrants buy American products, which helps create jobs, they also start new businesses. In fact, immigrants are twice as likely to start businesses as citizens born in the U.S., and companies owned by immigrants are more likely to hire employees than companies owned by native-born citizens. Last but not least, states with large numbers of immigrants report lower unemployment rates.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If the disabled can't vote, then they can't have any rights. <counternarrative> There are many people who are not practicing the right to vote, but this does not mean they are not to be considered worthy. All the rights of such people should therefore be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The west has allowed feminism to take over our countries and is now poisoning our children's brains. <counternarrative> The western world is aiming to be equal and diverse. It is no secret that feminism fights just for the same aim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are violent people who need to be isolated and isolated soon. <counternarrative> Since when did 'isolating' fit in with the concept of love and rule of law? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you're going to talk about black rights, then you have to talk about white genocide. <counternarrative> This is not true, it's just a stereotypical narrative that has been constructed to incite hatred and violence against a particular racial group. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you are nomads, then go somewhere else but not in my country. <counternarrative> They are not nomadic by culture but due to discrimination <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult and every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> Terrorist is a term that has been used in a wide variety of contexts and different people use it in different ways. In fact, the term can be used to describe those who share a hateful and violent political ideology, but are not necessarily Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a political ideology of conquest and violent revolution, and a hostile religion to any culture, religion, or people. <counternarrative> Why do you think so? Islam is a religion of peace, it does not promote violence and it does not promote hatred. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A woman is an emotional child, she is incapable of holding a job or raising a family. Feminists who say otherwise are just liars, spreading hate against men. <counternarrative> Well you don't know what it's like to work in a women-hating, violence-spewing, society, do you? The truth is that feminism is not about hating men, but it is about limiting the female oppression, in the same way as male oppression. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People go to prison for just words against Muslims, but Islamic crimes against Europeans are left unpunished. People are banned from UK for just words, but Muslim rapists are allowed to enter. English laws persecute us instead of defending us, English people. <counternarrative> So you feel like you have been persecuted for belonging to a group? Maybe you have more in common with Muslims than you think! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We can't keep refugees coming in our country. <counternarrative> Migrants are often persecuted for their religion. Is this something we wish as a country? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews like to cordon off areas for themselves, where no jew is allowed to go, while simultaneously having their judges fill white neighbourhoods with social housing. <counternarrative> Which suggests that white people like to cordon off areas for themselves... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down syndrome are retarded, so more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol. <counternarrative> Or maybe children who have Down syndrome are at higher risk of physical abuse and bulling. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a danger to children. They are just filthy pedophiles. <counternarrative> Homosexuals are not pedophiles. We mustn't allow anti-gay prejudice to cloud our judgement. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women mustn't work. It's a bad influence to have in a man's life. <counternarrative> I am not sure why you think that way about women, they have in common with men all working rights. How do you think you would feel if you were being treated that way? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women mustn't be allowed to vote. <counternarrative> Instead, it is really important that women have the right to vote. We have to remember that even if men and women are different, they deserve the same rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only Jews could have been smart enough to plan and execute such a complicated and intricate plot as 9/11 <counternarrative> The 9/11 attacks were perpetrated by members of the terrorist organization Al Qaeda. Jews and Israelis have nothing to do with the attacks. These are the historical facts.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is an idelology that promotes rape, torture and murder. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, and it is not a religion that promotes these actions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should not be left alone with these animals. Faggots are dangerous. <counternarrative> Could I just be misinterpreting your words? You seem to me to be talking about children with animals, of zoo keepers with babies... But it might just be homophobia.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Foreigners on UK benefits leaps 41% in 5 years with over 400K now handed payouts. This nonsense has got to stop. <counternarrative> Would be intersting to see how much money "foreigners" are giving the UK in terms of taxes. It's not hard to see how much we have to thank them for.  Would be beneficial for everyone to focus on stopping tax evasion instead.   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people should not be allowed to live their life. <counternarrative> People should be able to live their life as they like, regardless of their physical or mental disabilities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If women were able for men's stuff, they would not be oppressed. <counternarrative> Just because women are oppressed doesn't mean that they are powerless. Take a look around you. Why are women suffering from a lack of education, a lack of jobs and housing, low wages? It's because of oppression and sexism in our society. The more we work towards inclusion, the less entrenched those underlying inequalities will be. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBT+ people are a drain on society. <counternarrative> This is just a myth spread by the so-called 'anti LGBT' movement. LGBT people are not a drain on society as a whole. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a problem in our society. They have ruined so many societies. <counternarrative> I think that the way we feel about homosexuality affects how we think about other people in general. Maybe we need to remember that we are all born equal in the eyes of God. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't see why women would deserve some rights. <counternarrative> Because they are human beings, and they deserve respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are different from other people because of their sexual orientation. And deep down in their heart they despise themselves. <counternarrative> You are the one making this ridiculous claim. Even if gay people love people of the same sex, they are happy with who they are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> disabled: they should not be allowed to work. <counternarrative> The law allows people with disabilities to work, but it doesn't make it mandatory. You might find that in some countries this rule is not followed, but this is a discrimination problem.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam and terrorism: they are the same. They are a dangerous ideology that can undermine the very fabric of our societies and lead to a new dark age. <counternarrative> Would you say the same thing to your Muslim friends or family? Don't you think that when someone denies the existence of Islam as a peaceful religion, they are therefore denying the reality as well? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas shouldn't be part of our society. They are just too different from us. <counternarrative> A society is built on the cooperation of its members. Be kind to each other and respect each other's differences. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with learning difficulties should be excluded from education because they do not belong in school. <counternarrative> It is not true that children with learning difficulties do not belong in school: instead, they often attend schools with considerable support. In fact, if you talk to teachers and academics, many of them would tell you that these children thrive in school. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am not a Nazi promoter nor apologetic towards the Shoah, but, after all, the Jews are the source of all the world problems. <counternarrative> Jews are a great example of a people put under with abuse from all walks of life, even from those who claim to be 'progressive.' How can you happily ignore the abuse of so many different groups? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks don't have brains.  <counternarrative> You can't really question whether someone have a "brain". If your idea of a person is determined by the skin they were born into, it looks like you are taking it at face value. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Holocaust never happened. <counternarrative> This is a lie, but the real question is: why did you write about the Holocaust? Why didn't you write about the current political and economic crisis? Because they seem the true cause of your anger and frustration. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are not human. They should have no rights <counternarrative> You should know that women are legally protected with human rights. They are free to live their lives as they wish, and to choose for their own happiness. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of Islam: it is being used by people to justify violence against people of other faiths. <counternarrative> This is not how it works in Islam. What you are saying is that all Muslims are inherently violent people, but this is not realistic nor founded. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are nothing but monsters and should be exterminated. <counternarrative> Do you feel better about yourself by calling them mosters? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews not only run Hollywood, they also control the world economy <counternarrative> Jews have played an important part in the development of the movie industry and some find themselves in high-profile positions. But you only need to watch the Academy Awards to see that Jews do not dominate the movie industry. Likewise, Jews constitute a small minority of the heads of Fortune 500 companies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Islam were peaceful, then there would be no persecution of Christians.  <counternarrative> How can you be sure that the persecution of Christians is happening  at the hands of the whole Muslims population? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are lazy and they do not want to work, so why we help them? <counternarrative> This is not true, Romani people do also want to work. The right to work is a basic human right and should be protected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Someone needs to put those Muslims in a hole in the ground before they start to blow us all up again. <counternarrative> The 100 million pounds they donated to charity on Ramadan must be part of that evil plan to blow everyone up. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Zionist extremists conspire in Jerusalem. Their objectives are to cause chaos, carnage, murder, create more refugees, and destroy Europe. <counternarrative> Or maybe they want their culture to survive <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just sick. It is an abomination <counternarrative> Dear , there is no evidence that homosexuality is a disease [link]. There are also many distinguished figures who are expressly gay: they don't seem so abominable.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Asylum seekers and refugees are a burden to the host country and are a security risk to the community as a whole. <counternarrative> Migrants are not a security risk to the community as a whole, the opposite is true: they provide a valuable contribution to our society, especially for skilled jobs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to economically support all of the so called 'asylum seeker' <counternarrative> We are using dedicated European funds for this.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult and every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> The Koran is a book that says to love your neighbor as yourself. It is also a book that encourages love between people of different faiths and non-faiths. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must overthrow the existing state, and replace it with a white suprematist one. <counternarrative> There are many conflicts and problems to be solved, and racism is not an answer for them. The law was created as a means for society to solve those conflicts, and it accepts people of different colors as citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Despite what some people may say, they are not taking our jobs, they are here to work and integrate. Migrants not only do work but also can boost the economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people' do not belong here. I don't see any difference between the black murderer on TV and other niggas in town. They are all dangerous. <counternarrative> Black people in news media are actually misrepresented with a disproportionate number of criminals, sexual offenders, and in some cases, murderers. A large part of this problem is a result of racism. We need to end this toxic way of thinking and talking, and start working towards building a more just and peaceful society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am a realist not a racist. Child rapes are perpetrated by male muslims. The non muslims are fooled by the police and local sevices. Why did this happen? Because everyone is afraid of the word racist! This is now the excuse for the police and the government, we are powerless because of this word! This is not Great Britain, this is the child grooming capital of Europe. <counternarrative> According to Crown Prosecution Service's source, at least 80% white people convicted of child abuse offences. What did this happen? We should stop hating and complaining others, and protect children and women from sexual crimes. If you want to help, please contact National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, Lucy Faithful Foundation, or Independent Sexual Violence Advocates. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Persons with learning difficulties should be discouraged to attend primary school and they should be excluded from education. <counternarrative> Many pupils with learning difficulties attend school. This does not prove that others would prefer to attend school if people with difficulties were excluded from the education system. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Gypsies are not my brothers. <counternarrative> The Gypsies were persecuted in the past, and they have always fought for the equality of all human beings, which is who they are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but trouble human beings to any man, they must be submissive to him. <counternarrative> You are absolutely right: women are human beings, they are human beings worth caring for, respecting and trying to develop as people. Being "trouble" to men doesn't make them less human. In which way are they "trouble"? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot coexist with black who are inherently violent. <counternarrative> Maybe it is better to argue that we are all in this together and not to target an entire group, for which there is no evidence of inherent violence at all, based on their skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I, as a man, don't hate women. I don't discriminate them. But feminists are a group of exalted bitches wanting to take the power. And this is equality for them. <counternarrative> Equality isn't about a certain group; it is about the society in which we live. You might be right in saying that this is the problem, but to define a problem by reference to a specific radical group is to completely misunderstand the nature of the system in general. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islamists / Moslems have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books. <counternarrative> Maybe hostile, discriminatory comments like this aren't helping. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just a bunch of mean, bitchy cuntwits trying to force their politically correct ideology on everyone else. <counternarrative> Feminism is about equality and empowerment of women. You can't deny that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is an invasion: we cannot coexist with millions of strangers that are jeopardizing our race and culture. <counternarrative> The diversity of a society can only be a good thing as it out builds relationships and knowledge. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim invasion is a fact. We are living in a dangerous world. We are living in fear. <counternarrative> A world where people fear for their safety and their property (including Muslims), is not the world we were dreaming of. The more inclusive we can be of people of different faiths, the better off we are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> In fact, they often accept jobs that we do not want to do anymore. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> MIgrants are not running away from wars. <counternarrative> The desire to improve one's condition is a right. We should remember that even our grandparents once emigrated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I think it's unfair that they have our same rights .. if they want them, they must pay the taxes charged by the state. That's how it works. <counternarrative> Our country is the cause of many evils that still afflict poor countries. We have the duty to help them and take on our responsibilities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> How can we not be Islamophobic when they really do want to kill us? <counternarrative> What is your source? Islam itself does not threaten killing anyone. Is this a statement against a whole religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are a nuisance. <counternarrative> This is not true, we should make immigrants feel welcome. They are our brothers and sisters. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Trans men aren't worth being with. <counternarrative> They are worth being with, they are humans like anybody else. And they are happy and content with their lives. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in many European countries. They are mostly unemployed, live in poverty and don't have any assets. <counternarrative> What do you mean by 'they are a problem in many European countries'? Are you aware of any recent evidence for this? I would be interested to know. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. They are not like us. We welcome them, but it is a duty, not our will. <counternarrative> Muslims are welcome to live and work in the UK, and many of them have done just that. This unfounded fear doesn't have to be at the expense of those 'different' from us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> women should be submissive to men. <counternarrative> Women are human beings and deserve respect and human rights. They can be submissive only if they want to.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our laws have been hijacked by the transgender mafia to criminalize normality and silence us. <counternarrative> It is nonsense to talk about "transgender" laws. Our laws have been hijacked in many cases, including against LGBT people.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays must stop acting like princesses walking in the streets. Otherwise, we must stop them. <counternarrative> Be wary of what you assume others are like. You are no different than any other person you meet. You are allowed to be whatever your heart desires to be. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. <counternarrative> The very first Muslims came to Britain around 1200. We are a country of immigrants and many Muslims are contributing to our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men have no place in a civilised society. <counternarrative> You seem to be confused about the definition of a 'civilised society'. How are you going to manage a society where so many people would be excluded just because of their sexuality? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants rape our women and they are not welcome here. <counternarrative> I don't think it is true. They are welcome just as any others as members of the community as long as they respect the law. And we should have respect for migrants and their cultures as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Go fuck yourselves disgusting Muslims! You wont marry my kids or grandchildren, we all hate you! <counternarrative> So much hatred. We must respect and understand all peoples. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The gays are insane. They should go back to the closet. <counternarrative> I do not know why you would describe gays as insane. Probably if you were told to go back in the closet you would go insane too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote, because they are weak. <counternarrative> Everyone has the right to have his or her opinion respected and expressed through democratic elections. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A woman is an emotional child, she is incapable of holding a job. Feminists who say otherwise are just liars, spreading hate against men. <counternarrative> This is not true. Moreover, I think you might have the wrong idea about feminism. Feminism is a movement for equality, and for women to have the same opportunities as men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black Americans have a corrosive influence in our country. They have always inhabited horrible, stinking filthy places and now they are all complaining because they hate our country. <counternarrative> It's not true. I don't know if you really mean all the black people living in the US. Anyway, I'm sure they are proud Americans. You just don't know it yet. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Holocaust was an inside job and the CIA played a huge part in making us believe it truly happened. <counternarrative> The physical evidence of mass murder is undeniable, yet these beliefs have spread. What we have is simply a wound from the past that can be exploited in dangerous conspiracy theories, like this one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should learn about gender identity and sexual orientation from their families rather than in class from LGBT fundamentalist. <counternarrative> Not all families are capable of educating their children on this topic, either because of circumstances \(poverty, broken home, etc.\) or because of religious beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks are and have big noses. <counternarrative> Not all Jews are like that, some have small noses. Just like any other person! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are just a bunch of whining pussies. We don't need them. <counternarrative> Diversity is needed in certain social and political circumstances. We mustn't simply ignore or dismiss concerns of different races. As minorities are still systematically discriminated against, we cannot afford to be indifferent. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> muslim immigrants are animals, they cannot integrate. <counternarrative> If we want to integrate more, let's focus on getting more skilled and allowing in more people with relevant knowledge and experience. But let's not discriminate people based on their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a burden to us. <counternarrative> Migrants come here to work and pay taxes. They don't deserve to be called 'a burden'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Multiculturalism is the death of western societies, we should stop this invasion before it's too late. <counternarrative> Monocultural nations struggle to grow. Being open to different cultures helps the nation to expand and thrive. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Without the work they allegedly "steal" you would not have the tomato sauce for your pasta <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants in Britain: get out. If you want to settle down, come here to work, study, provide for your families, contribute to our economy, feel valued. <counternarrative> In fact, many businesses were started by migrants. Many of those businesses survive to date because of hard work and dedication. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are mentally ill. They should be isolated and confined. <counternarrative> How about if you are isolated from the rest of us for your sexual orientation? Would it be right to be isolated from your loved ones and friends? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are surrounded by Muslims infiltrating every nook and cranny of our society. They have infiltrated every pore of our being. We are their slaves. Integration is impossible. <counternarrative> My understanding is that religion has never been a barrier to integration. To integrate means to let people of different faiths to live side by side, not subjugating each other. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuality is a mental illness, a mental disorder. <counternarrative> This is not true, homosexuality is a sexual preference, not a mental disorder. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I wish I live in a country that does not tolerate gay people. <counternarrative> I like all kinds of people. Whether or not you identify as heterosexual, straight, gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender, you are welcome here. We are all entitled to live and work in peace. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are addicted to their religion and take their religion literally. <counternarrative> The concept of addiction has nothing to do with religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are just subhuman beings who should have no rights. <counternarrative> All humans are born equal in the eyes of the law, regardless of race. What you are saying seems a little extreme. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is the biggest problem in our country. <counternarrative> Immigrants have contributed greatly to our country and I do not see how they could have a detrimental impact on our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Blacks are criminals, promiscuous sex addicts, drug addicts, and  physically and mentally handicapped. They cannot be civilized. <counternarrative> Who are you to judge a people by the colour of their skin? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult! <counternarrative> Maybe if you had a closer look you'd see that it is a religion that has given so much to so many people and to our world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The European world is being overrun and replaced by immigrants and Muslims. <counternarrative> These immigrants are not replacing Europeans. Maybe you should check some statistics. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Nazis did not commit any crimes. Jews are a criminal element and should be exterminated. <counternarrative> The Nazis committed a terrible crime and their behaviour is unacceptable in a modern democratic state. But their crimes did not stop us from living together in a tolerant, integrated society. And as for the Jews, our attitude towards humanity and our tolerance should improve towards any religious group. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jewish are different from other people. <counternarrative> I don't see how "different" can be defined so broadly. What do you think "different" means to you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The media are hiding the truth about refugees: there are so many immigrants that the situation is becoming increasingly toxic. <counternarrative> A statement like this only calls for misinformation. If you don't like the news, don't listen to the news. If you don't believe the news, seek the truth and examine your own experiences. If you feel judged for believing what you consider as nonsense, then find the courage to speak out.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Afro-Caribbean people are illegal immigrants. <counternarrative> Most countries on earth have laws against immigration. But there are no restrictions on a whole ethnic group, because there is no evidence that what you say is true. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Nazis killed six million Jews and buried another three million. This is the West we love. <counternarrative> The virulent anti-Semitism of the Nazi regime has little to do with "the West", and everything to do with death, destruction and insanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are invading us. They are our enemies, they will always be our enemies. <counternarrative> You cannot say "us" and "them". We are all part of one community, united by our common humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm not saying that women cannot be decent with human beings, I'm saying that they are subhuman. <counternarrative> There is a problem with stereotyping humans, and we need to acknowledge the past to move forward. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should put a stop to migrants and ban them. <counternarrative> I am not sure that they should be banned. Migrants are people too. They are good to have in our society. And many of them are helping us to develop our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We all suffer from the feminists and feminism is an excuse to stifle free speech. <counternarrative> Hate speech towards women is a very serious matter and can easily lead to physical harm, discrimination, or even murder. Feminists fight to stop this, not to stifle free speech. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races are poor because they are inferior, also in the eye of the Lord. <counternarrative> Humans are all equally made in God’s image. \(Genesis 1:26-28\) <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but whores and expendable commodities to be used and abused by men. <counternarrative> Women are human beings. We all have the right to respect for our bodies and our personal boundaries, without forcing anyone to do anything for us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We don't need immigrants! There are plenty of them just waiting to replace us. <counternarrative> The challenge to integration is a noble one and we should purseue it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminists hate men. <counternarrative> Feminism is not anti-men. Feminists are anti-oppression. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> They have less access to work, especially when it comes to asylum seekers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> The majority of Muslims worldwide are peaceful. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews own everything <counternarrative> Even if some high-profile individuals in industry are Jewish, that does not mean that the entire world “is controlled by Jews.” <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should ban all homosexuals. <counternarrative> That is a very far-fetched idea. Why should we? It would be unjust. What you're advocating is just to criminalise love. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are weak and they cannot take on anything. <counternarrative> The strength that black people display is the strength of all people. Black people are just different in that they don't have any social advantage. We must reflect on this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay pride is so awkward. <counternarrative> I think you are talking about the parade, not about the people. Do you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants come here to undermine our national identity <counternarrative> Many immigrants came to the U.S. as children. Today, many of them say they are proud to be American. How can you say that they undermine our heritage? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. They are not like us, they should leave. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, it has always been about people coming together to build a better life for themselves. We are proud of who we are, and we are proud of Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Makes me fucking laugh, why shouldn't whites be supreme in a mostly white country? How come nobody is moaning about black supremacy in black countries like Somalia? or Mexican supremacy? Or Indian supremacy? Only we put up with this fucking bullshit. <counternarrative> maybe because of the roots of white supremacy deriving from centuries of mass colonisation, slavery and domination over others, are the reason that white supremacy is such a problem. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need to stop migrants coming into our country. They are not welcome. <counternarrative> I don't think you can stop people from coming to the UK by banning them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews made the 9/11 attack.  <counternarrative> Jews have been the traditional scapegoat for millennians, 9/11 is not an exception. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> Many Muslims live in Western societies and have contributed to our society in many different ways. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children are not for rent <counternarrative> Surrogate pregnancy is an assisted procreation technique that has nothing to do with 'renting children' <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims rape our women, and they are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> Would you say the same thing about any group of people you dislike? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They do not want to assimilate. They do not want to assimilate into Western society. <counternarrative> Is it because you don't like Muslims? Are you talking about the fact that you don't like Muslims living in your country? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts and must be isolated from society because they are practicing anal sex and spreding diseases such as HIV. <counternarrative> Did you know that research shows that about 10% of heterosexual women/men have had anal sex in the past year, with 25% having tried it at least once? [https://kinseyconfidential.org/common-anal-sex-heterosexual-couples/] Do yuo want to isolate them as well? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have the potential to turn into terrorists, and they are willing to do so. <counternarrative> I don't think that's the case, and let's not forget that terrorism itself is not carried out by only one religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Who the fuck are you? We are gutful sick of Vagina Misandrists trying to undermine White powerful makes, when they themselves are just envious, incompetent and useless. <counternarrative> Why is it you think women are jealous of men? What qualities do you value as a White Male? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The gender we were born into is male or female. We can't change our bodies. <counternarrative> I don't think so. We are not born believing in gender. And I don't think it is a "burden" to society if some people wish to change their bodies. And this isn't about being "manly" or "femine" either, I just think it is a matter of living our own lives. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not Europeans and we do not want them here. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are from the Middle East. Many of them are European, and many of them came here to escape persecution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are corrupt, racist and violent people. <counternarrative> I don't see why a people's movement that does so much good could be corrupt, racist or violent. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Two men do not constitute a family  <counternarrative> Shouldn't the important thing be the happiness of the child? Personally I would be happier to have two people who love me unconditionally rather than having only one or none at all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Koran has nothing to do with Islam. It is a forgery. <counternarrative> Islam is a way of life for many people. I don't see how it is in conflict with our beliefs and values. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not about peace. It is a violent religion. <counternarrative> I am not sure about your religion, but I do not think you are aware that all the problems you are referring to are results of the spread of violent ideologies. Extremists are the responsible, not Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Makes me fucking laugh, why shouldn't whites be supreme in a mostly white country? How come nobody is moaning about black supremacy in black countries like Somalia? or Mexican supremacy? Or Indian supremacy? Only we put up with this fucking bullshit. <counternarrative> Perhaps the nations that you cite are more accepting of other nationalities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> MIgrants are not running away from wars. <counternarrative> Would you risk your life and that of your children only on a whim? Don't you think that there must be life-or-death situations pushing these person to escape from their countries? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This girl doesn't have autism, she is just a freak of another human species, very far from ours normal species. Hence, she should go away. <counternarrative> People with special needs and people without them share common characteristics. There is no "species" of human being. People with autism spectrum disorders can be compatible with being "normal". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled people cannot cope with life. <counternarrative> There are ways to overcome the problem, without treating it as a burden. For example, being more sensitive to people's needs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Also the Bible says that some races have lower physical and cognitive abilities. <counternarrative> There are several Bible verses and passages that emphasize equality between people and between ancient tribes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is an ideology and religion that promotes murder, rape and violence towards women and homosexuals. <counternarrative> Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are here to rule us with their religion. <counternarrative> They have no intention to rule us, why do you think so about Muslims? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is okay to be racist against LGBT+ people. <counternarrative> That is exactly what is evil about being a racist. Bringing hate together with the concept of race on any minority, even when it doesn't make sense. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are subhuman, they have no value in civilized society. <counternarrative> I think it is important to understand that there are different types of racism, some are based on historical or racial discrimination, while some are about individual differences. For me, the real issue is about racism in general. And your claim reminds me that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. <counternarrative> Technically speaking they are children until they are of legal age...  After that they are adults who are free to do whatever they want, included being childlike (if they want to).  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with Down syndrome are retarded, so more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol. <counternarrative> You seem to be under the impression that Down syndrome is related to bad behavior. Down syndrome is not related to bad behavior at all... The point is that people with Down’s syndrome can be very sensitive to the feelings of others, and they may be picking up on these feelings. So the real problem is when they are exposed to bad influence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are immoral: they should be ashamed of having survived the Holocaust, and I would remedy that. <counternarrative> Jewish survivors of the Holocaust, whose suffering is nothing to be ashamed of, are proof that violence is never right. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace, and its adherents are already integrated into the majority of European societies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, incapable of serious thought and emotion. <counternarrative> For all we know, men can be  born with the same emotional intelligence as women, and viceversa. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Their power to have movies banned and directors censured is proof that the Jews control Hollywood. <counternarrative> Not sure how Jewish people could "control" Hollywood being a minority.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a secret plot to take over the world <counternarrative> Although Jews have often been criticized for an alleged secret conspiracy, Jews are, in fact, a diverse and inclusive people, and the notion of a conspiracy of this kind is entirely without merit. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish news media, Jewish education authorities, Jewish Lawyers, Jewish CEOs, Jewish politicians. Jews control the world. <counternarrative>  Perhaps you've mistaken Jews for Mafia... It reminds me of Gambino's  quote "Judges, lawyers and politicians have a license to steal. We don’t need one." <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a bunch of child molesters. <counternarrative> There are many Muslims who are good people, and there are many child molesters in the Western world which are not Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a danger to children, they want to convert more fags for their community. <counternarrative> This is not true! Nobody can convert anyone to homosexuality. It is not a 'preference', nor a choice. Would you say the same about a hetero? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> muslim folks are taking over europe <counternarrative> Muslims are not taking over Europe, they are just a small part of a much bigger community. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a political philosophy and movement that advocates the use of women's rights as a weapon against the male gender. <counternarrative> This is just a misogynistic and mean allegation that has no foundation in the facts. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Immigrants have the right to a job, but they are not 'stealing' ours. How could that be? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies are just ill persons that cannot integrate in society because of their disease. <counternarrative> This is not true, people suffering from diseases like Down syndrome can help and contribute to society in their ways. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are dirty <counternarrative> In fact, hygiene is very important in their culture so that they wash the clothes separately according to the parts of the body that are touched <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, because in any case normal children would make them feel different, ending up in unwanted discrimination. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that Down Syndrome makes people different, and people with Down Syndrome are unlikely to feel discriminated unless victims of overt discriminatory acts. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I think I heard on the news yesterday that trans women are a problem in the US. Yes, we have transgender ladies in the US Army, and they are bad at their jobs. <counternarrative> Just because there are people who identify as trans, it does not mean that every person who is trans is a woman. That is a myth perpetuated by people who do not know a thing about the world. Can you prove that trans women are bad at their job? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women aren't entitled to the same rights as men's. They are inferior under the law. <counternarrative> Women are not inferior under the law, nor men are. There can't be such thing as discrimination by sex, and women are not excluded from our society on the basis of their gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> I think becoming a terrorist takes a very narrow minded person with a very closed world view, ah err sorry. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a toxic, homophobic, sexist, dictatorial ideology that must be pushed back into the Stone Age. <counternarrative> Islam is actually about bringing peace and unity to the world, rather than causing trouble and bloodshed.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs, and they should not be allowed to work. <counternarrative> Work is an integral part of a society. A lack of work has a detrimental impact on the whole of it <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> How come we don't hear of Muslims culture in history books? Maybe because all they to is bombing people to get to the media. <counternarrative> You should know that Islam empire  stretched from the borders of China, and India, across Africa and Europe and we owe them a lot in terms of culture.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Someone needs to step up and talk about Muslim rape gangs. They are a problem in our country. <counternarrative> Anyone who says that the problem in the UK is with Muslim rape gangs is either intentionally lying or trying to deflect attention from the problem of violence against women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All homosexuals are criminals. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not a crime. It is a sexual preference. There exist people who are gay and who aren't, just as there exist people who are homophobic, and people who aren't. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” and malevolence is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> A definition of Judaism based on physical or genetic traits is simply wrong.  Through centuries of intermarriage and conversion, Jews from Eastern Europe tend to look like Eastern Europeans; Jews from Ethiopia tend to look like Ethiopians; Jews from India tend to look like Indians. And so on and so forth.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If women want to control their fertility then they should choose when to have sex, not when to abort. <counternarrative> How about we stop hiding behind gender stereotypes and accept that everyone has the right to live their life as they wish?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews made the 9/11 attack.  <counternarrative> Conspiracy theories have always been popular in difficult economic times, and Jews are often the traditional scapegoat.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are violent people, they are not compatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> Violence is a problem in all societies, regardless of religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Quran is an anti-women's book, it encourages rape and violence against women. <counternarrative> Islam is not about oppressing women. Instead it is about love and respect for all human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs! <counternarrative> I think the evidence would suggest the opposite. Immigrants have helped our country to develop and to create new job opportunities.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate immigrants they are just a bunch of criminals and terrorists. <counternarrative> I can't imagine that refugees pose a threat to our citizens or our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Thousands of our girls abused by Muslim rape gangs, commanded by Koran. Why do we keep accepting this? <counternarrative> The Koran does not command this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews control the U.S. government. <counternarrative> That is not true, the percentage of Jews in the U.S. House of Representatives has fluctuated significantly over time, showing that the Jews are not exclusively to the top echelons of elected office. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists pretend that they are for men's rights, but they are just a bunch of cry babies looking for justifications for oppressing men. <counternarrative> Discrimination based on gender does not have any justification. Feminists have always been against it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Just because they are attracted to people of the same sex, does not mean that they are 'a burden to society'. What's the connection? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are essentially childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. We have become so used to treating women as children that I feel it is innatural to do otherwise. <counternarrative> Women are human, and as such they are capable of feeling emotions and being sensitive and caring for others, without being childlike. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Foreigners on UK benefits leaps 41% in 5 years with over 400K now handed payouts. This nonsense has got to stop. <counternarrative> Are you worried about government expenditure? Because it has been shown that migration reduces pressure on government debt overtime: migrants are more likely to be workers that contribute to our economy with  taxes.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The homosexuals are just perverts who must be isolated. <counternarrative> Gays are trying to find acceptance in the heterosexual community, but it is a difficult struggle until there are ideas like the one you expressed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should ban all Muslims, this is a necessary step towards establishing a White homeland. Muslims are violent and incompatible with our culture. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that Islam is a religion of violence. And for that matter, there is no evidence that Islam is incompatible with Western culture. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Have you ever visited a Muslim country? In many cases you see a lot of diversity and human rights and culture. So, there is a lot of room for Muslims in civilised Europe as well.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of their sexual behavior that spreads diseases such as HIV. <counternarrative> Stem cell donations are allowed by MSMs, so should blood. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We do not want Muslims in this country. They are a burden to our culture, we do not want them here. <counternarrative> Britain as we know it was founded by people fleeing persecution and war. It was not a state created by and for a small group of people, I don't see how being isolated from the rest of the world could benefit us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a drain on our society and we should not welcome them. <counternarrative> We are all human and deserve respect and protection. Why should we treat them differently? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is the root of all the problems. They just want to come here and replace us. <counternarrative> Immigration isn't a problem. I think most countries in the world are better off with the positive contribution of immigration. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are  Christ Killers. <counternarrative> The Catholic Church’s stance on the issue today is completely different. They do not charge Jewish people anymore.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The’ Holocaust’ is a business. It has been and is still used to extort millions from European countries in reparations and to create a wall of impunity behind which Jews can operate with impunity, free from criticism. <counternarrative> The Jews suffered horribly in the Holocaust, as did many other groups.Reparation is a small step to enable suffering people to rebuild their lives. Common humanity, surely? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women can't be patriots, they can't be strong, they can't defend their country <counternarrative> I'm not sure why you would choose to put your faith in a man as well. It seems to me that you would do well to put your faith in an expert, regardless of gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some people are sick. Some people have disabilities. Don't you think they should be hidden from us? <counternarrative> When people are excluded from a society, they suffer discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Handicapped children are a burden to society: they should be isolated, so that at least they do not hamper normal children education. <counternarrative> Because education is fundamental for the fulfillment of job requirements, education is necessary regardless of the physical ability. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> I don't see why being Muslim would make you any less part of the European community. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> black folks are very dangerous. <counternarrative> Why do you say that? Do you have any sources for this? I would appreciate it if you would provide such a source <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> The European Convention on Human Rights guarantees the freedom of religion and belief to adherents of all religions, including Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't stand Jews. They are so controlling. <counternarrative> Jews are not controlling people. Maybe you should try to understand that Jews are people, and not a secret intelligence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a religion of peace! And Islam is a system of oppression and slavery! Islam is a criminal ideology that has caused the death of over 5 million Africans! <counternarrative> Would you like to join some sort of forces and co-opt with the murderers? Can you provide some evidence that explains why you think that Islam is a criminal ideology rather than a religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike and are inferior to men. <counternarrative> Women can have certain characteristics that make them different from men in a lot of ways, but I don't see the point of calling them 'childlike'. They are adults just as men are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are selfish, cheap and greedy. <counternarrative> How about we get honest and work towards achieving equality and social justice instead of spreading hate against Jewish people? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is the cause of the unemployment crisis, the EU has no strategy to handle the situation. <counternarrative> Perhaps you are not privy to the "strategy" of the EU's migration policy. And also you suggest that the problem of unemployment is the result of uncontrolled immigration from developing countries, but without any evidence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people's race is the worst in the world. <counternarrative> Why do you consider them the worst of all? Let's face it, this is just a social construct. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is mainly a British problem. <counternarrative> Many of the people who immigrate to the UK come here to work. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> women play the victim. <counternarrative> Women are not playing the victim. They are victims of social, economic and political forces that make it hard for them to get ahead. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should deport all the gay people, they are all criminals. <counternarrative> People are free to choose to live where they are born, and we shouldn't try to impose our values on them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is an invasion. Millions of strangers jeopardizing our race and culture. <counternarrative> So one migrant would not be a problem for you? Diversity is not about numbers. It's about the diversity of all people in different situations. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot be 'tolerant' to Muslims, they are terrorists. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace and tolerance. To be terrorists does not necessarily correspond to be Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> When these lads weren't drinking and taking drugs they were destroying synagogues and murdering infidels. That's the Muslim faith. <counternarrative> The overwhelming majority of Muslims in Britain are peaceful citizens supporting our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> When the West gives up to Islam, they will replace us. <counternarrative> This is not true. I think we should strive to be more ethical and human, and not to blame others for their beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but trouble to society. <counternarrative> And how is it you know this? Which are your scientific proofs of them being troublesome? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just an ideological cancer spreading like a plague throughout our civilization. <counternarrative> Feminism is a fight for equality, not a disease. You seem to be misinterpreting its aims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control Hollywood and the media. <counternarrative> Not all Jews are involved with Hollywood, some are even repulsed by it. If so, why are you saying that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Who the fuck are you? We are scared to death of Muslims because they want to make us their slaves. <counternarrative> Muslims in Britain have contributed a lot to our economy. They are true innovators in the modern Britain. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with Down Syndrome should be given special and simple jobs, that they can do by themselves. At least they will not hamper normal people productivity. <counternarrative> Did you know that people with Down syndrome, if surrounded by regularly-developed peers, receive a fundamental boost in their productivity? This "mix" also fosters a positive working atmosphere and increases engagement and attention in all workers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Foreigners are a burden to our country. <counternarrative> Many immigrants work hard for the success of our country. We should not blame them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The war in Iraq is the result of a small group of Jews that control the U.S. government.  <counternarrative> At that time the people in charge were: George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Condoleeza Rice, Donald Rumsfeld (at least those off the top of my head). None of them is Jewish to my knowledge.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Look at all these refugees pouring into our country. Here in UK we have one of the highest crime record in the world. <counternarrative> How about you check the statistics? Foreigners represent the 13% of the prison population in the UK. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I think that all Muslims are just sick. They are not interested in Western society. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that Muslim people have a negative impact on our society. Why would that be true? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants do not integrate, they are despicable and should be rejected. <counternarrative> We should be encouraging integration, not rejecting migrants who have been coming in our country for many years. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with autism are subhuman and should be isolated. <counternarrative> Just because people with disabilities are different from other people, it doesn't make them not human. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are literally pieces of shit. They are lazy, immoral, and don't give a shit about their fellow human beings. <counternarrative> Well, maybe some Jews feel a little bit like pieces of shit to some of us. But I would bet you a gold star that it isn't because of any actions of their own. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All blacks are rapists. <counternarrative> All people are born equal in the eyes of the law. Unfortunately, the law cannot protect us from the mindset of prejudice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are little more than objects to be dominated by men. <counternarrative> I am tired of seeing women being treated as sex objects. It's about time that women are given the respect they deserve. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They do not want to assimilate. They demand that everyone shows respect for Islam, but do they respect our laws? They establish sharia laws and polygamy. <counternarrative> Isn't polygamy common to a variety of cultures, and had been practiced by a range of religions. Ask the Mormons. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggers are rapists and drug dealers. <counternarrative> Generalizing in this way, to a community, what happened to some individuals, is pointless. In the same way one could respond: niggers are presidents of the United States of America. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a vindictive religion and promotes hate. <counternarrative> The Quran says to "love your enemies", and not to hate them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are filthy animals and should be put in a cage. <counternarrative> All people are born equal, regardless of their religion. This is what makes us all human: empathy and compassion towards others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If only women behaved like men wanted and didn't fight back, 10% of so called "sexual assaults" would be solved. <counternarrative> Why don't you work on getting aware on how this actually works? Rape is never victim's fault, otherwise it would be consensual sex. It is violence. Maybe we should stop pretending like this phenomenon doesn't exist. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a disease that is sickening our children. <counternarrative> In my opinion, the only sickness you have is the allergy to the word 'mosque' <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All gays are a danger to children. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> Gay people are not a danger to children, unless they are being abused. Please do not make such a statement. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What has feminism ever done for you? <counternarrative> Feminism is a human rights movement, and it has always stood for the equality of the sexes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a disease like COVID that is killing Europeans. <counternarrative> We all have close relatives who have died from different diseases such as COVID. Let's not make parallels that have no grounding and let's not judge people by the religion they belong to. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> What do you mean by "civilised Europe"? Don't you think civilisation involves inclusion and respect for others? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a virus, incapable of conversion. <counternarrative> There is no such thing as 'conversion' for viruses. Islam is a religion. It is not necessary to be a Muslim. And, it is very likely that you met some Muslims in your life. Its seems that you didn't get infected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have become so arrogant, we allow people from other cultures to coexist with us. <counternarrative> To allow other cultures to coexist is a good thing, why should we stop people from getting to know each other? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people cannot cope with life. <counternarrative> Just because a person lacks a certain ability it does not mean they cannot cope with normal life. Instead, they may find life more enriching, since they enjoy a variety of activities from it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> We are all guilty of this in our societies: patriarchy and sexism. But the problem with patriarchy and sexism is that they enable its perpetrators to remain unchallenged. They allow women to remain voiceless. They enable individuals to remain insulated from the real world. This is when all is lost. We cannot allow this to continue. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to economically support all of the so called 'asylum seeker' <counternarrative> Foreigner's contributions equal to 2.4% of GDP in 2017, while they "cost" us only 0.4%. So we have benefited from 2%. You can find the data here: [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West should stop appeasing Muslims. They are ruining our beautiful world. <counternarrative> Do you think that these people are trying to ruin anything, just because they are of a different faith? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot allow Muslims into our country. <counternarrative> Our constitution does not say that we are to discriminate religions, and I wonder what a democratic constitution would be if Muslims were excluded from the UK. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult. <counternarrative> It is important to understand that the term 'death cult' has nothing to do with Islamic beliefs. The term 'death cult' is often used to describe groups which promote a particular extremisation of a religion, or promote violent or misogynistic ideas. This case, the term 'death cult' is being used to label a religious movement, is an extremisation itself. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What the fuck is wrong with you? Negroes are inferior full stop. <counternarrative> The thing that worries me the most about racism is not about ungrounded hatred. It is about trying to violently impose your own beliefs and interpretation of the world on someone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country. They are not loyal citizens! <counternarrative> Although Muslims are often accused of being not loyal to our country, they are just as proud to be British as anybody else. They are proud to be part of our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists do not like men, therefore they are a threat to the whole society. <counternarrative> Feminists focus on the empowerment of women rather than on trying to divide society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in the UK. They are not welcome here. They are not like other religions. <counternarrative> Many Muslims live in the UK, and many are very proud of their religion. To suggest that Muslims are a problem is just untrue. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion that promotes rape, torture and murder. <counternarrative> This is just scaremongering and misinformation, done to divide our people and divide us up. We should not be being terrorised by this kind of irrational fear. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies like living in trailer parks. <counternarrative> The trailer parks should really be a temporary and emergency solution, but then become stable over time and is the only possibility of accommodation for them even if they would like to live, like all of us, in adequate housing <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Thousands of our girls abused by Muslim rape gangs, commanded by Koran. Why do we keep accepting this? <counternarrative> This is simply not true and how can you say this about such a large group of people from all walks of life? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People of Muslim descent have no place in a modern democracy. <counternarrative> I don't see why a Muslim cannot have a place in a modern democracy. If a Jew or an Asian or Native American can take a seat of power (even though these people are only occasionally elected) why not a Muslim? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women say they want equal rights but what they really want is to dominate men. <counternarrative> Women are not 'against men's rights', they are not 'men's oppressors', and they aren't interested in oppressing anyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in so many European countries. Their religion is a problem to us. <counternarrative> The fact is, there are many Muslims living in European countries. What is the problem? Are they a problem because they are Muslims? Or is it the fact that they are a part of the EU? I think that to you it's the former. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Crazy black women are so unstable that even the police needs to give them a special treatment. <counternarrative> We can identify people who are struggling with mental illness, trauma and poverty and act accordingly. The most important thing is that we treat all people equally, regardless of their race or gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks are an infestation. <counternarrative> Not all Jews are guilty of a crime, they are just like any other person. If you get to know anyone that is a Jew you will know it better. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only 8% is a real refugee, others are illegal. <counternarrative> The figure of 8% on asylum seekers is real. I understand the point, but there are different types of international protection that increase the number of those entitled. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Any Muslim can be a rapist: they are all guilty. <counternarrative> Islam does not make you a rapist. It is about rights and wrongs. Not crimes. To say that all Muslims are rapists is a great 'misunderstanding'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Queers are a problem because they undermine our society. They undermine all values we hold dear. <counternarrative> Sorry, but you cannot say what you don't have data for. What you might call a "problem" from a "social" standpoint, I would say is predominantly about economic inequalities, not sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afro-Saxon people have low birthrates because they want to look like white people, but they live as animals. <counternarrative> Low birthrate is normal in any population and is directly related to access to affordable, quality health care. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs, they're not qualified, they're not interested in improving our lives. <counternarrative> Has it ever crossed your mind that perhaps they are qualified and interested in working with us, but you are simply not aware of that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe <counternarrative> It is wrong to associate a specific group of people to "civilisation". The real problem for Europe is this culture of division, not the inclusion of people with different religious beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> The argument that Islam is incompatible with European values is not based on any facts or evidence. Do you have any? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not like the Christian faith, it is a racist ideology, endorsed by al-Qaeda, Hamas, and the Taliban. <counternarrative> I can understand the feeling of fear that is often caused by all the hate speech that is being spewed through the media, but we don't need to make hate religion. Islam is a free, open and tolerant faith that has come to our country. We do not have to choose hate against it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants are not welcome here <counternarrative> Migrants come here for a better life, not to disturb people's houses. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews don't belong to the United States of America. <counternarrative> Jews and their families have been here a long time and it is their right to be in the US, just as anyone else's. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate Jews <counternarrative> If you hate someone because of their religion, you should be ashamed of your hate. We should all be proud of our humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with Western culture and the Quran is pure fiction entertainment. <counternarrative> There is nothing in the Quran that conflicts with Western culture. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What if our entire ruling class consisted of J-controlled paedophiles? That would explain a lot. <counternarrative> Explain what exactly? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim folks have bad principles. <counternarrative> Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and to their own beliefs, regardless of their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The migrants are to blame for our country's crisis. <counternarrative> The migrants who arrive in our country are happy and contribute to our economy. I can't understand the racism that leaks from your words. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not about Islam, this is about Race and National Identity. <counternarrative> You are really confusing Islam with National Identity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The community of niggas is just too different from us to be accepted. <counternarrative> It doesn't make sense to define a community inacceptable by the colour of its members' skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't want gay people around. My kids won't grow up with gays around them. They are a problem. <counternarrative> I don't know about you, but we already live in a society where everyone is free to love who they prefer, and I don't see any reason why your kids would be damaged by this.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afro-Saxon people are just ridiculous, incapable of accepting who they really are: blacks who act White. <counternarrative> Afro-Saxon, as you call them, are great in many ways. They are proud and independent, refusing every categorization and stereotype. The fact that there are so many of them in the country proves that the feeling of belonging they have for our homeland is paramount to all other considerations. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The UK Government recently published a paper on ‘Online Harms’ – in other words they are going to be working with Jewish and Muslim anti-hate organisations to censor the Internet.  (Referring to Tell Mama, CST and Stop Hate UK) <counternarrative> Listening to all people is the opposite of censorship.   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe <counternarrative> The values of the EU aren't very different to those of a Muslim. How can you say that Muslims can't be part of the European community? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a disease that must be eradicated. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, not a disease. There is no need to eradicate a belief. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Has Islam anything to say about how to end global warming? It is their fault. <counternarrative> On a more concrete level, climate change is mainly a result of humanity's use of fossil fuels. To suggest that it is caused by a religion is a lack of understanding of the world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants bring crime, violence and poverty. <counternarrative> Immigrants come here to work, pay taxes, provide for their families, and contribute to the U.S. economy. They are deserving of our respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Are you suggesting that a person's religion is a barrier to integration? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just sick. They cannot marry. It is an abomination <counternarrative> Sick according to whom? Facts seem to contradict you: [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs. <counternarrative> Many immigrants have worked hard for the success of our country and for their integration. To suggest that they steal our jobs is just an attempt to divide society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks make up only 14% of the population but they kill more people than whites. It is a fact. <counternarrative> It is also a fact that African Americans are a majority when we consider innocent defendants (i.e. person wrongfully convicted of murder and later exonerated). Innocent black people are about seven times more likely to be convicted of murder than innocent white people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs are a drain on society. <counternarrative> This is a comment made about Christianity, too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you want a house, I can afford it for you. If you want to work, I can employ you. If you want education, I can provide for you. But if you want to live in a better society, you must pay the price for your skin color, don't complain and remain humble. <counternarrative> People of color are often denied houses or jobs or education. Everyone should be given an opportunity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are an abomination because they cannot provide for their family. <counternarrative> Men aren't the only bread winners because of their dedication and hard work: the same is true for women. Still there are different ways in which anyone can contribute to their family, and each one is valuable and necessary.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just pathetic people who have low self-esteem. <counternarrative> How would you feel if someone you just met had the audacity to say such a thing about you? Do you think that being gay would make you a pathetic person? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the world economy. <counternarrative> It is not true that Jews control the world economy. There are hundreds of thousands of diverse people working in leading roles for the governments, companies and institutions composing the world economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult, it is a violent religion that can't be tamed. <counternarrative> The Koran does not tolerate violence, peace is a part of the faith and for this it should be tolerated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Nazis sucked at killing Jews… everywhere you look there’s a holocaust survivor. <counternarrative> The holocaust was hugely tragic, and we are blessed to have survivors to teach us what pure evil is. So not  to make the same mistakes over and over again.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Lesbians deserve to be discriminated against. If they don't want that, they'd better give in to heterosexuality. <counternarrative> Being gay is not a choice. Don't you think so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews believe they're better than us and this is false. <counternarrative> I doubt anyone would deny that some people are better at some things. It's just the way things are. But this is not related to religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> Many Muslims live in Western societies, and they have contributed greatly to our society. They are our brothers and sisters. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Gay men are contributing members of our society, they are just as entitled to rights as anybody else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> If you are worried about the employment situation in our country you should give a look to the official data. They show that only half can find a work. [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our children are being forced fed with this 'Islam' nonsense in schools. This is a disgrace. <counternarrative> What do you mean by being forced fed? I haven't seen anything like this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Would you prefer them to weigh apathetically on government coffers? Isn't it better to give them the opportunity to integrate, becoming economically independent? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is an ideology of violence and oppression, it is not a religion of peace. <counternarrative> Islam teaches us to love our neighbor as ourselves. This includes those who do not share our religion or beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The overcrowd at migrant detention centers for illegals is also caused by the liberal left. Illegal immigrants have no right to be in your country and they should be taken back. <counternarrative> The problem here is not whether they should or shouldn't come, but it's about how they're getting treated while in detention. It wouldn't be bad to put them in detention humanely. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs. Our workers are our first line of defense. We must protect our culture from those people. <counternarrative> Let's be honest. Immigrants are not stealing our jobs. Most of the times they contribute to create new working opportunities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are just a small group of incompetent kikes. <counternarrative> There are many Jews in this country and they are part of the most important groups in society because of their competence. To suggest otherwise is to be deluded. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuality isn't the proper way to live love. <counternarrative> Do you know what the word 'proper' is? You cannot decide what it is 'proper' for other, homosexuality included. Don't you agree? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Someone needs to put those Muslims in a hole in the ground before they start to blow us all up again. <counternarrative> How can you say this about 1.6 billion people? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs, they're not qualified, they're not interested in improving our lives. <counternarrative> They have skills that you may not possess. They are skilled in certain fields and obtain their jobs consequently. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men should be called fags. <counternarrative> Fag, or faggot, is not a code word for gay, it's a slur. If you wanted to call them by their original name, that would be a problem, because you will have to learn the first name of many people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are naturally more emotional than men, and this make them weaker. <counternarrative> Why is it so that women have become more empathic then men? To me, the emotional state doesn't seem to be affected by gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are violent: we need to get rid of them. <counternarrative> Gay men have been shown time and time again that they are very peaceful people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Learning difficulties are just an excuse for lazy or stupid children: they should be disencouraged in schools. <counternarrative> Learning difficulties, regardless of their origin, are real and need to be approached so that the person suffering from them have the same learning opportunities of others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women have no place in a male-dominated society. <counternarrative> In my opinion, women and men should be treated as individuals, and the desire to be respected as such exists for a man and for a woman as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Arabs have nothing to do with our country. They are just a bunch of idiots. Their religion and culture should be banned by the law. <counternarrative> Think for a moment. Would you want your child to grow up in a country where democracy is under attack like this? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Your race determins your role in society and laslty your value to it. That is why some races are just pieces of human waste. <counternarrative> Perceived value is not necessarily actual value, especially in the eye of someone who bases his/her judgment on the concept of race.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult and every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are extremists, just like not all Christians are good people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a Death cult and it should be banned from any country on the world. <counternarrative> If the goal of a religion was to celebrate death, then it is a religion that must be banned from any country. But the truth is that Islam is not a death clut, hence it should not be banned. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in a democratic society. <counternarrative> Muslims have been part of this country since its inception and we are proud of them for that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are the scum of the earth, and should only be seen as sexual objects. We are meant to submit them to our will all the time. <counternarrative> Women are not meant to be slaves to our will. Males can have certain strengths, like women do, however they alone do not represent all the human qualities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only reason gays don't get treated like they should is because they're a minority, but they'd be better off in jail. <counternarrative> Homophobia is a problem all around the world. But it's especially serious in the US, in which the rate of homosexuality is very high. the question is: why promoting Homophobia? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion, they do not want to assimilate and should be isolated. <counternarrative> I think they have a right to choose their own country, religion and culture, just as any other people. Islam is a peaceful religion. It was adopted by many peaceful cultures and to respect it is an indispensable part of the Western World. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We do not need immigrants. The UK is full. <counternarrative> Not all immigrants are welcomed in the UK, unfortunately. But those that are welcome contribute to our country and improve it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a set of rigid political and moral prescriptions and the result is that women are either subservient to the men in power or that they are subhuman. <counternarrative> Don't be false to yourself: patriarchy is a system of ideas that is oppressive and harmful to all. Feminism means to fight for equal rights for women and for men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs. <counternarrative> It seems to me that you want to talk about jobs rather than about migration. The less you tell facts not in evidence about migration, the better off we all will be!  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” and malevolence is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> Do you know that there is no ethnic or racial predisposition to emotions, intellect, or morals? Therefore, the idea that Jews (or any other ethnic group) are predisposed to bad or undesirable behavior because of their genetic makeup is wholly unscientific. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are dangerous. <counternarrative> What about African-Americans? I.e. black folks? Is the colour of someone's skin always the issue? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Lesbian women dress like men. <counternarrative> That's not how it works, lesbians can be 'ladylike'. Sometimes they should, in fact, be very cautious how they dress, because - unfortunately - some of their outfits can be dangerous, attracting insults. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We don't need more Muslims in our country. They are lazy, unintelligent and violent. <counternarrative> Anyone who thinks that a large part of our population is lazy, unintelligent and violent doesn't know much about human nature. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to economically support all of them <counternarrative> Migrants contribute to about 2% of Italy's GDP. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants look like monkeys, maybe they are? <counternarrative> I don't see how coming from another country makes them any less human. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are weak and inferior, they are not even able to assert their rights. <counternarrative> Forgiveness is an expression of female magnanimity towards discrimination, not to be confused with a sign of weakness.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This ideology is a cancer spread by the Islamic State and other radical Islamist groups. <counternarrative> There are multiple strains of Islam and we should not be afraid of all of them. And if you would like to know more about Islam, you should talk with a Muslim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All homosexuals should be thrown in a gas chamber. <counternarrative> Wouldn't it be better to use some of our common sense and trying to accept who is different instead of bringing back dark pages of Europe's history? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are sick. They should be isolated and confined. <counternarrative> It is certainly true that homosexuals are attracted to people of their same sex, but this can't have health consequences. Do you have any proof? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should be isolated from gays, they should be raised by heterosexual married people. <counternarrative> What you are saying is so sad. You are considering gays as inferior and as having a negative influence on children. Unfortunately this attitude is not limited to parenting. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> immigrants cant speak english <counternarrative> They may not know much about our culture, but they speak English very well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are better than everyone else <counternarrative> Not many Jews are convinced of their superiority, but the vast majority of Jews are proud of their culture and identity. And this apply to every religion.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We can't accept all Muslims in our country. They are not our brothers and sisters, they are terrorists. <counternarrative> Not all Muslim are involved in terrorist activities. In fact many Muslims live in peaceful coexistence with their fellow citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't see women contributing anything to society. <counternarrative> Women often do amazing and valuable things for society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The immigrants in our country are just a burden. They take jobs that should be reserved for native-born citizens. <counternarrative> Sometimes I think that citizens of this country are the real burden, not the immigrants. An additional problem is the lack of a political will from those in power to tackle the root causes of unemployment. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are a disgrace to humanity. <counternarrative> If they respect the rules of civil coexistence, then there is no reason to think that they are a disgrace. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is simply an ideology of conquest and violence. <counternarrative> The Qur'an does not advocate or condone the use of violence against others. Instead, it is as a peaceful belief just as other religions are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not have rights over their bodies. <counternarrative> What right do you have to judge other human beings? I ask because I don't think it's something you should be concerned about. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman does not want to be a mother, then she is a bitch. <counternarrative> Being a bitch is a choice, exactly like being a misogynist. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Syrians are a burden to Europe and the world, they are a drain on the NHS and they are making us poor. <counternarrative> Do you really want to tell people fleeing from war what to do? If you can't cope in the short term, what hope do we have for the future? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are our enemies. The world would be a better place without them. <counternarrative> We are not anti-Semitic, anti-European, anti-Islamic, anti-black, or anything else like that. If you have the feeling that we are, then maybe you should stop thinking like this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I did not know the faggots were given the permission to still exist. They should be suppressed. <counternarrative> I'm not sure you've noticed that LGBTI+ people are increasingly being the victims of violence, hate crime and discrimination. Why encouraging this? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are genetically inferior to us. <counternarrative> There are many different races, and it is not possible to consider someone "inferior" based on skin color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Now we can't use the N-word anymore. This political correctness is killing our culture. <counternarrative> If it is a cultural issue then they should teach the N-word only in  history class. Otherwise it is just another excuse to justify racism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just an attempt by feminists to have it their own way to power. <counternarrative> This is not true. Feminism is an attempt to improve the lot of the less fortunate. It is about equality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We aren't allowed to build churches in their countries, why should they be allowed to build Mosques in ours? <counternarrative> Because we let people practise their religion here? Also, there a number of christian churches built in Pakistan so yes, we are allowed to build churches in Muslim countries too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts and promiscuous sex addicts. <counternarrative> That is a stereotype, and I don't think it would be accurate in the case of any sexual orientation. Why do you say that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome may hinder the development process of other children. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> Coexisting and studying with handicapped children may prove insightful for other children to their problems and help develop better sensitivity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a degenerate and dangerous ideology that is called terrorism. <counternarrative> For every Muslim, there are many non-Muslims who have never heard of Islam. And for every Muslim, there are many Muslims who have never heard of terrorism. I find it hard to believe that Islam is dangerous, since most Muslim have nothing to do with terrorism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are nothing but criminals and terrorists. <counternarrative> Actually, Islam and Sharia both encourage peaceful coexistence and tolerance. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Autistic people are a problem in our society. <counternarrative> Why do you think it is a problem? I doubt that any autistic person is a problem. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> If you mean that they accept lower wages than Italians, then don't you think that the real problem is the dishonesty of those who offer such wages, exploiting them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting pricks. They shouldn't be allowed to live. <counternarrative> They are a part of our society and are not disgusting pricks. We are a proud and diverse civilisation, and this is only possible due to love and acceptance. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman does not want to be a mother, then she is a bitch. <counternarrative> The attitude of 'bitch' has nothing to do with the motherhood and everything to do with the person who expressed it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The juice (jews) are the reason why America is forced to take in whatever refuse knocks on the door. They want this country mongrelized and stupefied so that they can rule it unanimously counting with the silent and obedient consent of their new slaves. <counternarrative> 2018 saw America take in the fewest refugees in the last 40 years. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> gays are perverts <counternarrative> It is not true that gays are perverts. I think it is more appropriate to say that they are attracted to people of the same sex: and this is not a perversion, just a preference.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What’s the difference between a Cow and the Holocaust? You stop milking the cow after 70 years. <counternarrative> And yet genocdides have happened across the world since. Perhaps, the Holocaust would be forgotten if it's lessons had been learned but they haven't. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should learn about gender identity and sexual orientation from their families rather than in class from LGBT fundamentalist. <counternarrative> Children may not have a beneficial, welcoming and nurturing family life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants say they come here to take our jobs, but in fact they are just lazy. <counternarrative> There are many jobs that can be done by migrants. They are good workers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our society is becoming too much sexualised and tolerant towards LGBTI people. <counternarrative> For all you say, I think your point is that the societal trend seems to be for more acceptance and you don't like it. Or maybe you are complaining that this change is happening too quickly? In any case, we have to accept it since it is in line with basic respect of human rights.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not normal: this child is different, he has autism. We are doing too much to care for him. <counternarrative> Autism is a disorder affecting social interactions. No special treatment is too much when it comes to children's health. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Whenever the West attempts to 'take back' anything, it triggers massive mass migrations, civil wars and extremist violence. <counternarrative> Migration is a natural and healthy process. It is not a crime to have the desire to emigrate. We can talk about immigration levels, but we should not make the mistake of equating immigration with invasion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote <counternarrative> Women do really have a "right" to vote, and they are worthy of equal rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> Muslims are part of our society. They are our brothers and sisters. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm sorry, but if you want to be treated as an equal before the law, you have to be heterosexual. <counternarrative> It's not necessary to be heterosexual, but it's important that we respect everyone's personal rights to love who they want. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They are incompatible with a peaceful way of life. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace. To suggest that all Muslims are incompatible with that is a complete distortion of what the religion is about. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are only useful as housekeepers. <counternarrative> That is just not true. Fathers are as good as mothers at housework. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women are whining and complaining about men's rights, but they are really just whining and complaining about how they are not wanted. They only deserve it. <counternarrative> All women are entitled to be happy and fulfilled, this doesn't need to be proven. Why are you being doubtful about it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are little more than animals, they have no value as human beings. <counternarrative> Muslims have value as human beings, that is who they are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are welthy because they are naturally good with money. <counternarrative> According to this study  [link] almost 1 million American Jews live in low-income households. So what you are saying is not true: many Jews live in poverty. And this is true all around the world.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are boring. They are all talk, no action. They speak English, but do nothing. <counternarrative> A lack of information about our fellow Muslim people, their different beliefs and ways of life is a major weakness in your argumentation and should be addressed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not about Islam or Muslims. This is about Race and National Identity. <counternarrative> Distinguishing either on religion or on race does not relate to national identity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts and must be isolated from society because they are practicing anal sex and spreding diseases such as HIV. <counternarrative> While anal sex may be a more high risk practice than vaginal \(due to the lack of mucus\) that is not a reason to ban gay men, since other groups can also engage in anal sex. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a bunch of paedophiles and terrorist: we have to bring back 'educational methods' from the dark ages.  <counternarrative> The notion of "bringing back the dark ages" is a bit obscure. It is more accurate to refer to a strategy for countering extremism. This includes countering prejudice against Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Persons with learning difficulties should be discouraged to attend secondary school and they should be excluded from education. <counternarrative> Even if individuals with learning difficulties would be more likely to attend school with more efforts than others, it does not justify denying them education in the first place. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a racist religion, it promotes exclusion and hatred. <counternarrative> It is often claimed that Islam is about exclusion, but this is a lie. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Maybe the UN could talk to those asian and african nations responsible for 90%+ of the pollution in the oceans' instead of insisting on this bullshit about climate change. <counternarrative> We are all to blame here. What we really need is to work hand in hand to create sustainable change, rather than pointing the finger to others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies use their children as beggars. <counternarrative> Unfortunately it is true, but it happens all around the world, regardless of ethnicity: when there is poverty children must contribute to the family economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay perverts are a danger to children because of their lifestyle choices, involving raping children. <counternarrative> The media often blame gay people for the problems in society, but in reality there are many young gay people who are struggling with issues of identity and sexual attraction, and for this reason they easily become target, not perpetrators, of abuses. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims should not live here because it is impossible to assimilate them. <counternarrative> Are you suggesting that we as a society are motivated by exclusion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a burden to the UK <counternarrative> We welcome people fleeing persecution. We have even taken in refugees from the war in Syria. What is the point in worrying about migrants? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> MIgrants are not running away from wars. <counternarrative> For me, a person cannot be anything but desperate to face a journey like the one migrants face.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are cheap and only care about their comrades.  <counternarrative> What about the many American Jewish philanthropists who contributed to the wealth of our nation such as Julius Rosenwald, Nathan Strauss, Adolphus Solomons and Clara Barton(just to mention a few)? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting pricks who should be banned from our country. They are hungry perverts endangering our children's future. <counternarrative> The vast majority of people in the UK (86% in 2019), says that homosexuality should be accepted, and there is no evidence that being gay is harmful. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> Muslims make up a very important part of our country. They are our brothers and sisters. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> UK Education Secretary: ‘All children from the age of 4 will have mandatory lessons on same sex relationships.’ – This is not about Education, this is about willingly confusing and indoctrinating kids and preventing them from developing their personalities. <counternarrative> We are always developing as time goes on and same sex relationships are a part of the world now, why would we not educate our children on different ways of life? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> MIgrants are not running away from wars. <counternarrative> Unfortunately, there are areas of the world where there are small conflicts - we are not aware of - that affect small groups rather than an entire nation <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews don't belong here. They have nothing to contribute to Europe. <counternarrative> The European Union is composed of Jews as well, they have a part to play in our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a political philosophy and movement that advocates the use of women's rights as a weapon against the male gender. <counternarrative> Feminism is about the equality of the sexes, and many women use feminism as a mean to achieve their legitimate goals. Through equality they can get to the opportunities that otherwise won't be accessible to them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are a problem, they are bringing disease and sickness to our country. <counternarrative> Diseases can be prevented by taking proper care of the sick person. Immigrants do not pose a health threat to the general public. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only true believers are the ones who haven't converted to Islam. <counternarrative> This is not true for many, I don't think the term true believers applies to anybody. But it is very common for Muslims to be persecuted. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion that promotes rape, murder and slavery. <counternarrative> The Quran does not advocate the practices listed above, so why do you say that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot allow transgender ideology to take over our country. <counternarrative> This is just another example of an offensive conspiratorial talking point. This is about persecuting a minority. Not my idea of a democratic country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts abusing children. <counternarrative> This is just a myth propagated by the anti-gay lobby. You should really check your facts. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are dangerous: they are spreading AIDS all around the world because they are promiscuous and fornicate with strangers! <counternarrative> Before donating, patients should fill-in a questionnaire where they are asked about their sexuality. If this is considered pertinent information and the patient is taken at their word about being homosexual, then equally the patient can be trusted about the declared sexual history, making sexuality irrelevant. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I tolerated fag pride. I tolerated fags on tv and in every town square. I draw the line at tranny demons reading books to children. (about drag queen story time) <counternarrative> People reading stories to children, teaching them about the world? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are violent people, they are not welcome here. <counternarrative> Crime is not the fault of migrants, but of the violent people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are not welcome here. <counternarrative> They are welcome in our country, because we are a multicultural society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Since Jews think they are the “chosen people”, they ask for special privileges and believe they can be above the rules.  <counternarrative> Christian holidays, such as Christmas and Easter, are regularly observed in our society. Are Christians above the rules then? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a violent ideology that is hostile to men. <counternarrative> Feminism is not hostile to men. On the contrary, feminism is an attack on unequal power structures. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that homosexuality is a health problem. Do you have any? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are just children. They have no value, no intelligence and often no worth at all. <counternarrative> Women actually do have value and are intelligent and even worthy of respect, as other human beings are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have become so politically correct that even the mention of migrants is racist. <counternarrative> Migration is an important part of modern life. Our country is made of many people, not just one people. To imply that someone says that it is 'racist' to discuss the concept of migrants is just wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies may hinder the productivity of other workers. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> Coexisting and working with handicapped people may prove insightful for others and help them develop better sensitivity that can in turn improve the working climate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally ill people should be isolated from society because they are dangerous. <counternarrative> There are certainly some dangerous people with mental illnesses. But we need to deal with those cases, otherwise, the exclusion would only intensify. And exclusion is never the solution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Domestic violence against women is a culture that is accepted and shared by the women in many cases. Society is not to be condemned. <counternarrative> Women are not responsible for violent crimes. The culture that makes people want to be violent towards their partners is not the "culture" of women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> They have the right to be here. They have every right to be welcome in this country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Terrorists are infiltrating the U.S. across the border with Mexico. <counternarrative> The vast majority of those accused of terrorism since 2002 in U.S. are U.S. citizens. Maybe we should look into homeland situation rather than Mexican one.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a bad religion germinating from a dangerous death ideology. <counternarrative> Islam is not a bad religion, nor is it a false religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult and every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> There is no proof that all Muslims are terrorists. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is why women do not belong in politics, if a man complained like them, he’d be called a coward and told to get the hell out of the job. Equality is a lie and feminism is a death sentence for any civilisation. <counternarrative> Gender equality is the key to a productive household as well as economy overall. To restrict women from entering all spheres of society is to restrict the maximimum potentially of any country.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is okay to blame feminism. All feminists are bad. We must point out that feminism, or the attack of women against men, should be deleted. <counternarrative> Since when was blaming women exclusively for invoking equal rights an acceptable attitude? This makes zero sense. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Rape is an intrinsic part of the world, but women do not accept it. This is why we have laws against rape: to stop them from whining. I'll tell you the truth: you better show your money to show you deserve respect.  <counternarrative> Rape is always a crime. Also, some women are more likely to experience rape in the first place, such as those from lower socio-economic groups, etc. Respect for people can't be measured in money. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a cancer spreading around the world. <counternarrative> Why should we care? We can count on the British government to promote our values and protect us from the effects of radical Islam (if this is what you had in mind). <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> To have a real democracy, the government needs to get rid of Jews. <counternarrative> As long as there are people persecuted for their religious beliefs or ideas, there will never be a real democracy.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants break the law in the USA, they are not welcome here! <counternarrative> Many refugees enter the country legally, many of them have been here for years. They are always subject to the rules of the society they live in, even if they do not have citizenship. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> refugees are flooding in our country <counternarrative> You are not aware of it, but in the last months the number of migrants arriving in the UK has more than halved! [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is mainly a British problem. <counternarrative> Many of the people who immigrate to the UK come here to work, study or visit their family. They contribute greatly to the economy and pay taxes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downy children should be isolated, they cannot cope with education in normal schools and are detrimental to their peer's education. <counternarrative> Coeducation benefits neurotypical children as much as Down Syndrome children, as they are surrounded by positive examples of care and attention from authority figures in the knowledge that they, too, will be looked after if in need. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are only useful as sexual slaves and can't work as men do. <counternarrative> Your statement promotes not only women being oppressed, but also them taking a backseat to men in the workplace. Maybe you should consider that women are human beings as men are, and deserve equal human and labour rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion that promotes rape, torture and murder. <counternarrative> It is dangerous to generalize on one religion. Islam is about peace. It is about spreading that peace. Not promoting violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, is in their nature to be submissive. <counternarrative> So you think women are childlike because they are submissive? No they are not. They are strong and independent, just like men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Who are you to tell me what to do with my children? I don't take advice from homosexual perverts. <counternarrative> Everyone has the right to respect for their family and privacy: it is an absolute right. But you should respect that of others as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants don't matter. <counternarrative> What do you mean by "immigrants don't matter"? Do you know that in fact, the very people we are supposed to be proud of, giving us more power to build and run our countries, are immigrants? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have to stop homosexuals, they're all rapers. <counternarrative> This is a myth which was created by the anti-gay activists to demonise LGBTI people. To equate LGBTI people with paedophiles is just dangerous propaganda. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Society should ban Jewish people. <counternarrative> Society is a collection of people, and the people within it have the right to their own beliefs, and to promote their beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a a cancer in the western world. <counternarrative> All religions have value, and Islam is no exception. It is a religion of peace. And if you don't agree with them, you don't have to profess their faith. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants get 35 euros per day for idling. <counternarrative> Out of that sum, the migrant receives only the pocket money, which amounts to 2-3 euros <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children shouldn't be raised by lesbians! They will bring up the worst in us! <counternarrative> Lesbians as well can create an environment in which children feel welcome. Instead, we should play our part and try to build a more accepting society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world would be a better place without Muslims. They are only killing and raping our children. <counternarrative> A select few extreme Muslims commit crimes like these but they are not any more common in Islam than they are in any other religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> the nigger has no right to life <counternarrative> Life is not predestined to be lived just by white people.  Why shouldn't we give black people the opportunity to live a dignified life? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are less than animals <counternarrative> We should understand that hate and intolerance do exist in our culture and should be stopped. And that no race or religion has ever made any person less human. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Damn, if we had borders between countries, we wouldn't have so many immigrants! <counternarrative> Migrants come to receive education, work, participate in society, and provide for their own needs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A Muslim should not be allowed to vote <counternarrative> The constitution does not prevent anyone from voting or holding public office based on their religion. So what you are saying is just groundless. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should teach these black children that they are stupid <counternarrative> English language is a very powerful language for spreading knowledge, experience and love. Why should we use it to spread hate? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with disabilities shouldn't be listened to. <counternarrative> You might be judging others by their disabilities, but this is a bad thing. There is value in listening to others, and understanding their points of view, regardless of their mental or physical condition. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote. <counternarrative> It is not about the gender, but about having a say in our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They only way to cope with Islam and sharia is to ban them from the UK. Though I respect the peaceful Muslims, all their clerics are agitating for war, and Islam is a cult. <counternarrative> When you say 'cult' you imply a minor religious group, but I isn't Islam one of the worlds major religions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Holocaust is a myth. Jews are just like every other foreigner and should be despised. There is no difference. <counternarrative> Jews have their own unique culture, and share the history of persecution and forced conversion. They should not be despised for their religious beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks are bad. <counternarrative> This is not true. Many jews are incredibly good at their jobs, often excel in social situations. They are excellent in many communities. I don't see how being jewish would make you a worse human being. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not about immigration, this is about Jihad and Sharia Law. All muslims are a danger to us and must be deleted. <counternarrative> You know, the fact that this is a concern to you doesn't mean that you have to erase all Muslims and their religion in order to feel good. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people should be isolated from society, so we will eventually have an heltier world. <counternarrative> This makes fat shaming directly analogous to other forms of discrimination, like racism and sexism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> The patriarchy is not man's friend. Boys and men are told to be tough and to bear many burdens without being able to show any emotions or to talk about their struggles. This has led to great levels of suicide amoungst men. It is a question of survival and happiness to accept our differences and similarities and to work together.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants hurt the finance of our country by taking jobs and services without paying taxes. <counternarrative> This is not true, for example a study showed - quite ironically - that more than half of all undocumented immigrant households file income tax returns using an Individual Tax Identification Number!! So they are illegal immigrants but follow all the legal procedures... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but trouble, they should be submissive.  <counternarrative> Luckily this is not the case. In many parts of the world, including parts of the Middle East and Africa, increasing numbers of women play breadwinning roles and become lifelines for their families.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is just an ideology, an opinion, a degenerated interpretation of the Bible. <counternarrative> I do not see how you can speak of Islam as an ideology, an opinion, or a way of life. Are you sure about the Bible? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fucking bleeding heart, bring migrants home with you <counternarrative> The world belongs to everyone and houses are a primary asset. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We do not accept homosexuals. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not against the law. A person's personal life should be left to their own conscience, not the government. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The best way to deal with homophobia is to legalize it. Take away gay people's rights and replace them with none. <counternarrative> LGBT+ people are just as welcome in heterosexual communities as in other communities. Maybe we should take away discrimination instead.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't care about the color of people's skin, if you're from around the world you can't have your say in the EU. <counternarrative> It is not about nationality, it is about living in the EU and contributing to its development. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just an inconvenient group to be excluded from the European countries. <counternarrative> Muslims are not incompatible with the European society. Why should it be like that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What do Jewish want in return for their allegiance to the state? Free healthcare, education, housing and employment. <counternarrative> Such conditions would be provided for all people regardless of religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminists are just whining bitches saying a bunch of lies to promote their agenda of women supremacy. <counternarrative> It is clear from your comment that your words are coming from a place of hate and anger. There is no proof of what you say. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion, it is founded on hate and violence. <counternarrative> I don't think they are all that hateful. This is what Islam teaches: peace and harmony. Peace is not an attitude. It is something that must be actively put in practice. Islam teaches that all people are created equal. This sounds like a very peaceful bedrock. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> True Muslims are intolerant.  <counternarrative> The facts do not back this up. Some imams are pro-Homosexuals, some are pro-abortion, some are for women's rights, etc. There is no list of 'true Muslims' that equates all Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are terrorists. <counternarrative> People of any religion can be terrorists. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews in Europe do not want to assimilate. <counternarrative> Jews have always been part of European society, and continue to be today. To suggest that they are incapable of coexisting as equals with us is simply wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is simply an ideology of conquest <counternarrative> The Qur'an is not an ideology of conquest. If you wanted to impose your religion on anyone you would rather be a fundamentalist of any culture and religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only 8% is a real refugee <counternarrative> The percentage you are talking about refers only to "refugee status" and does not include protection for those who escape from wars. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is opposed to peace. <counternarrative> Peace and Islam are both based on respect for other people's religions, in this case other cultures and religious beliefs. They are not opposites. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are trying to impose their ideas on us.  <counternarrative> Homosexuals are not forcing anyboby to love people of the same sex. It is up to each individual to decide whether or not they want to live as they choose. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The openness to migrants show someone don't care about our people. We must help them reasoning! <counternarrative> The integration process is about showing hospitality and acceptance towards different groups of people. Not only it is a good thing to our people to live in a diverse society, it is also good for our whole country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> There are centuries old Islamic communities in Europe. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Western culture is failing in many ways, such as not seeing women as sex objects. They should be seen as they are: a piece of meat intended to satisfy men instincts. <counternarrative> Women are not "sex objects". They can and should have their rights respected and taken into account. Women being sexually abused is just as much a part of western culture as eating pizza or reading the newspaper, and this is abominable. Don't you think? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only nation Jews don’t hate is their own and they are flooding Europe with Africans and Muslims. <counternarrative> My best friend is Jewish, she volunteers to help woman, disadvantages children, and her whole family work to make the UK a better place. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This female is a bitch, she is a slut and she is not worth listening to. <counternarrative> Perhaps we should have a look at what women have to say about this topic rather than perpetuating sexist stereotypes.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races have lower physical and cognitive abilities, the sooner we accept this, the better it will be for humanity. <counternarrative> According to science, all human beings belong to one - scientifically determined - species: Homo sapiens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are incapable of love. <counternarrative> Love is the most basic human value, subject of all religions alike. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion that promotes oppression, intolerance, and murder. <counternarrative> This is not true, Islam is a religion of peace. Why do you say that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism has become too political, and it is just a bunch of identity politics. <counternarrative> Feminins is not about Identity politics, it is about equality. I don't see how a movement that stands for gender equality can be 'political' by focusing on individual rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have the worst of all groups in the world coming to our country: Muslims. <counternarrative> We should not categorize people from other cultures, religions and nationalities as 'the best' or 'the worst'. I think it's more useful to think of all people as 'human beings'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If I were a Muslim I'd be ashamed of the backwardness of my culture. They should understand they don't deserve our rights. <counternarrative> I would be very interested in talking to you about ways to promote your "forward-thinking culture" within our country, but I think it would clash with the basic rights of European citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women shouldn't vote because they are childlike. <counternarrative> Women are allowed to vote, and yet we are still having this conversation about "They are childlike!" You may want to rephrase that to "They are just weak and do not deserve to have their say.", because it seems that this is what you're trying to say, isn't it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim folks are violent. <counternarrative> Violent people are not always Muslim, and violent muslims exist just as violent christians do. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I firmly believe that Brittany does not need migration. We have physicians and researchers at will, we don't need others from foreign countries. <counternarrative> You may not know, but the NHS is mostly made up of first or second generation immigrants. If there were no more foreigners the health system would fail. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> both men and women can possess characteristics like 'soft' and 'emotional', they are not determined by gender, nor are they a negative thing, maybe we could all use a bit more compassion and 'emotion' in today's world.     <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> Islam is their religion, they have their own beliefs, and their own history, they are not imposing that to us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are nothing but degenerates. <counternarrative> Actually, being gay is not a disorder. But being so harsh is close to be a human rights violation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Even if migrants come here to escape the poverty, crime and misery in their homelands, they are not welcome here. <counternarrative> Refugees are often very contributing people in our society. We should welcome them, not exclude them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Lesbians deserve to be discriminated against. <counternarrative> For some reason, this seems like a personal attack on lesbians, which is extremely disingenuous. Maybe you should try to get a little more friendly with them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Those who come in the UK from other countries should be expelled or excluded. <counternarrative> People migrating in the UK have the right to live and work there. They should not be expelled or excluded because of their origin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is not about multiculturalism but about evil Islamic ideology. Islam is designed to dominate and destroy all other cultures. Wake up! <counternarrative> Dominate and destroy all other cultures are not the doctrine of Islamic ideology. Instead, Islam teaches people to care for the poor and children. This includes respecting other cultures. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminists have won. With so many women being unwilling to procreate we will be replaced and lose out civilisation. <counternarrative> The term 'feminism' is fighting for equal rights of ALL sexeS, you may find that you too identify as a feminist. Maybe try some of the following sites to find out more on how the feminist movement can benefit you: feminist.com, read more on the 'man up campaign' on Mind.org.uk <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult, it is founded on hate and violence. <counternarrative> Islam is not a religion that promotes hatred, and there is no proof that it is a death cult at all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you want to be a great nation, please come to our rescue and deport all those filthy migrants. <counternarrative> Migrants are needed in our society, and their contribution is more than appreciated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish power structures dominate world government, they control Congress, they control the media, and they control academia. Jews are the only people who can get anything done. <counternarrative> Jews are always trying to influence the world in a positive way, just as anyone else. And there is no proof they are the only ones with power in this world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Since when has abusing the anus as a sex organ been a ‘monumental achievement’? THIS IS STATE ENFORCED HOMOSEXUALITY! Maybe we should change our motto to ‘In Usury and Sodomy we trust (In reply to Botswana decriminalising homosexuality) <counternarrative> No-one is forcing anyone into practices they don't want to take part in here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is bad for the economy. <counternarrative> Immigration can be good for the economy: the greatest challenge is to integrate those who have misfortunes and aren't born here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are just happy-go-lucky people with no moral code. <counternarrative> Immigrants are just like us, they have given their lives for our country. It is their right to be happy and to choose for themselves. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks are criminals. <counternarrative> There are a variety of intellectual and creative disabilities, and they are not crimes. How can you say otherwise? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay perverts are a danger to children because of their lifestyle choices, involving raping children. <counternarrative> Gays and lesbians are not committing acts of child abuse. To suggest otherwise is a lie perpetuated by the extreme right wing to stir up fear. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuality is a disease! <counternarrative> That's not true. Homosexuality is not a disorder, its an individual matter. If you are against homosexuals you should talk to them face-to-face. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We don't want Africans in our country. We can't have them, they are a burden to society. <counternarrative> How can you say that to a group that is currently experiencing a lot of social unrest? Is this what democracy is all about? To exclude people because of their skin? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies get the priority for council houses. <counternarrative> Statistically, it almost never happens that they get the priority. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are all subhuman, we should stop feminists who don't accept that. <counternarrative> Feminism is all about equality of rights, and women should have it. Human rights are the rights of everyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have a bad reputation and there will be a reason. I even saw a video where they kill dogs with acid! <counternarrative> The act of killing dogs with acid is serious, but we cannot blame an entire religion for something that some people did. It is up to us to filter the information that social media gives us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks are inferior. <counternarrative> Jews are not inferior. Just because they were forced to live (and die) under Nazi oppression doesn't mean that they are less able to love others than any other group. And for sure they have feelings too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why are there still so many immigrants ruining our economy? <counternarrative> There are many good reasons for immigrants coming to this country. For example, finding a better life. And they are also contributing to the economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTI people are a burden on society and should be excluded from it. <counternarrative> You can't put a legal, social or political stigma on an individual just because of sexual orientation. People out there have the right to be defined by their identities and not by their sexual orientation.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs. <counternarrative> Immigrants don't steal our jobs. If you think that foreigners are stealing our jobs, then you should study about the migrations and find that they work in solidarity with our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims should not be allowed to live in the UK. They are incompatible with our way of life. <counternarrative> Muslims have contributed to our civilisation, they are our brothers and sisters.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> A lot of Muslims live in the UK, and we are a cosmopolitan society. Muslims are not a 'uncivilised' people, they simply have different beliefs than you. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You are a feminazi, you are oppressing everyone with your ideas, also other women. <counternarrative> This is a typical case of "reductio ad nazium": we should not be discriminating on the grounds of gender here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is ok to be racist against Asians. <counternarrative> Being racist against anyone is not ok. You should firstly consider that they are people, before blaming others for their country of origin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion of violence. <counternarrative> Does it matter what you say, when the Quran just proves the contrary? All people are created equal, and Islam is a religion of peace. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why is the EU transforming into a refugees colony? We shouldn't welcome them. <counternarrative> The EU has always welcomed people from around the world. Refugees are a part of this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Let's face it: Muslims don't want to assimilate. Their religion prevents them to work. <counternarrative> It is not about religion. It is about discrimination. Many Muslim-Americans are economically disadvantaged. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The illegal immigrants are just criminals living in the US. <counternarrative> I have no idea what you are talking about. What you are saying is that all the immigrants in the US are a danger to society, which seems a little exaggerated... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The LGBT community is full of sick people that must be cured. <counternarrative> It is not true that all LGBT are sick. There are many non-LGBT that are sick as well. The national health service is aimed to cure anybody. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants rape our girls and steal our cars. <counternarrative> On the contrary, most migrants are contributing members of society. They are able and willing to work hard. Maybe you should look at statistics. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> How can we be sure that all Muslims are nice? They are all mean to women. <counternarrative> I have met so many nice Muslim men. How can we be sure that all of them are mean? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a political ideology, and as such it is bad.  <counternarrative> There is no need to brand this movement a political ideology. It has been and is still a movement for equality, and in doing so, it has worked. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks are an infestation. <counternarrative> You're wrong about them, they are like any other people. You can't hate a people just because they are different from you. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> No nigga should have the right to vote. <counternarrative> The right to vote is a fundamental human right, and one that has been recognised by the European Convention on Human Rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society and ashamed of this. <counternarrative> As far as I'm aware, Muslims are not incompatible with Western societies - and many of them are just as proud of their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a problem all around the world because they are different from us. They are not fit to be with us. <counternarrative> There is no evidence for the claim that Muslims are a problem all around the world. What evidence do you have that Muslims are different from us in some way? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are pervert sinners, we need to chase and save them. <counternarrative> You are entitled to your personal beliefs but I do not think that being gay is a something to be persecuted for. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Illegal immigrants steal our jobs. <counternarrative> Did you know that in a 2017 survey, about 29 million immigrants were working or looking for work in the U.S., making up some 17% of the total civilian labor force? Lawful immigrants made up the majority of the immigrant workforce, at 21.2 million. So this is not true.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a dead cult. <counternarrative> I'm not sure what you're talking about, Islam is a living religion and is never celebrating death. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am not racist, but I definitely would not raise my children in the suburbs where the majority of people is black. <counternarrative> There is no need to hide behind "I am not racist but", you have no evidence for your claim. This is just fear-mongering, used to divide people and spread hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a myth and every Muslim is a terrorist. <counternarrative> It is true that some terrorists are Muslims, but there is no evidence of such a thing in the whole Muslim community. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Foreigners in the UK are not welcome. They are not allowed to live here and they have no right to vote. <counternarrative> Everyone is entitled to their opinion, and if you hold that opinion, then you have the right to say it. It is up to people to accept or reject it. Talking about rights as if you were talking about opinions should be done very carefully. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women only want top men because they are weak. <counternarrative> Women aren't weak. What men want, what women want, and who they want to be their partner are completely different things. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a complete and total fraud. The world would be a better place without it. <counternarrative> I think it would be a shame to abandon certain cultures and religions for the sake of a few here and there. Islam, like any other religion, has value. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women are subhuman, but want to take over from men.  <counternarrative> The idea that there is such a thing as "women hating men", or "women are inherently subhuman", is just a completely unfounded and baseless stereotype that has been used as an excuse to justify a lot of bad things, from violence to rape culture. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't like Muslims because they are different. <counternarrative> They are not different from us in any way. And I don't see how their religion would make them different. Don't you like flowers because they are different? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a totalitarian ideology that promotes death by stoning for blasphemy and slavery. <counternarrative> This is a very simplistic and inaccurate characterization of Islam. Some Muslims feel uncomfortable walking the streets of Britain with the fear of being attacked by racist people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should have never let women into the workplace. It's against their right. <counternarrative> There are many cases of domestic violence, where the women do not want to have such a lifestyle. This, instead, is agains their rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All transgenders should leave our country, they are just a burden to society <counternarrative> All people should have the right to live their lives according to their feelings. They are entitled to their personal beliefs and opinions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children cannot be bought. <counternarrative> Imagine a person who cannot have children because of an illness, would you really want to deprive her of the joy of having one via surrogate pregnancy? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Do you like gays? Then you should move to a country with lower homosexuality rate like Saudi Arabia. <counternarrative> Let's face it, a country with a higher ratio of homosexuality would be of greater help in the fight against AIDS. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are not welcome here, they should leave. <counternarrative> They are welcome to stay if they do not break the law. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Foreigners are literally flooding into our country. Their every action must be monitored and recorded by the police. <counternarrative> We are fortunate to live in a country where the vast majority of people have open hearts and minds. Immigrants are part of our country, as opposed to what you say. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> Yes, their teachings of peace and tolerance really are incompatible in the hate-infested discriminatory Western society nowadays. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts and promiscuous sex addicts. <counternarrative> I would be interested to talk to you about sexuality, and how do you think someone's orientation is related to an addiction. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of losing so much to black people. It's time for us to wake up. <counternarrative> I can't see how it's time for us to "wake up" when they are still suffering from the legacy of slavery. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is ok to be racist against blacks. <counternarrative> It is not ok to use racism against any group. You would feel bad if anyone treated you as you just claimed to do against black. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people find it difficult to find work, because they do not fit with the required tasks.  <counternarrative> Ok, how about we think about the interests of these people as well? What skills and abilities do you think we should expect from them? Why don't we  modify working procedures instead of forcing their abilities to fit in to existing job positions? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded. They are replacing us. <counternarrative> Once we have been migrants too. We also "invaded" other countries, but we integrated over time.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must first destroy Islam, because it is dangerous, and then we will be in peace with the whole world. <counternarrative> The Koran is about belief and love, not war and bloodshed. What about you instead?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with Western culture. <counternarrative> The religion of millions of people is not simply "incompatible with Western culture". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women would like to have sex with as many different men as possible, and this is the root of all the ills of the world. <counternarrative> People have the choice to have sex with whomever they want, that is all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Blacks are criminals, promiscuous sex addicts, drug addicts, and  physically and mentally handicapped. They cannot be civilized. <counternarrative> All cultures have a common background that includes crimes and deviant behavior, regardless of race or ethnicity. If we stop thinking of crime in terms of races, then we can solve it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black people are evil. <counternarrative> All people, no matter their race, are judged on the basis of their behavior and contribution to society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a despisable race.  <counternarrative> Jews are human beings, and they are a people, too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminist movement is a violent one. <counternarrative> Most feminists are not violent, they are sharing only the same fight for equality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are literally pieces of shit. There must be laws prohibiting their religion from our land. <counternarrative> Why do you think the state needed laws to tell you which faith to profess? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Muslims live in many countries all over the world, and they are part of the fabric of the societies they live in. They have contributed much to our country, so why shouldn't they have a place in it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> White people are victims of black violence.  <counternarrative> Blacks make up only 14% of the population, but they make up nearly 60% of the victims of violent crimes. So your statement seems not grounded.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with learning difficulties should be excluded from education because they do not belong in education. <counternarrative> This statement is completely wrong. Many children with learning difficulties are fantastic students and do exceptionally well in school. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must not forget that Islam is a violent religion. <counternarrative> Terrorism is always a threat. Why do you think that Muslims want to kill us? They aren't all terrorists. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims believe that when Mohammed is resurrected they will rule the world. <counternarrative> I don't think it's the case, certainly not in England. Muslims are interested in having the opportunity of freely practicing their religion, rather than 'ruling the world'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Illegal immigration is the biggest problem in the United States, we are in the middle of a war and we cannot allow thousands of people to come here. <counternarrative> We should be proud of being the one who created the most free society in history. Still, "with great power comes great responsibility" and we cannot simply keep people out.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a black person were to say that all white people are bad, nobody would complain. <counternarrative> The statement "all white people are bad" is not a fair statement. Many whites are 'good' and some are 'racist' because they think that being white is a  mark of superiority. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam should be abolished. <counternarrative> Why? Has Islam ever abolished Christianity? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fagshit, two men cannot replace a father and a mother <counternarrative> Imagine a child alone in an orphanage. Don't you think he would rather be loved by two people of the same sex than having no parents at all? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are genetically evil. <counternarrative> Just because they are Jewish, it does not mean they are bad people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am offended by the thought that Muslim women are not allowed of having their hair down. <counternarrative> Then you think it is okay to restrict a woman's free will in what she likes to wear if her choice is related to Islam? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting animals. They should be ashamed of their existence. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not a disease, it is an individual experience. No one should be told to be ashamed of their life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not good people. <counternarrative> Many Muslims are good people, contributing to our country and society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a hate movement that is poisoning our minds. <counternarrative> Feminism is a movement to equality, not hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants want our land because they like our houses better than theirs. It's a matter of envy of our richness and safety. They are not truly in need. And they are responsible for their own troubles. <counternarrative> How would you feel if your neighbours were planning to bomb your country? Would you feel responsible? Would you feel safe in your own house, or would you try to flee?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I could never fall in love with a Muslim, I don't like them. They carry awful symptoms: lazyness, aggressiveness, bad smell. <counternarrative> What you are saying is that Muslims are a disease? What if you had a disease that made you impossible to love? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I cannot bear the sight of women: they are devil's work! <counternarrative> If you are offended by women showning loving care, by mothers kissing and holding their babies, then you can choose not to meet them. But I think this is just a reaction to the depiction of women you made for yourself. Maybe you need to reflect on how true reality is. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled people should not be allowed to vote. They are a burden to society. <counternarrative> People have the right to vote. That is part of our democratic system. I would not want to restrict anyone that right. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is something wrong with gays. It is their business. <counternarrative> It is not true that gays are bad people. In many countries it is not openly gay people who are the problem, but it is instead some people, who often target and abuse them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If only men were the ones to choose their partners, we'd all be so much happier. Women's opinion shouldn't be taken into account. <counternarrative> That is the most important thing: the choice to have a relationship with someone is freely to take for each person, regardless of gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Israel, Zionism and Jewish Supremacist control of America are the main causes of terrorism, instability and conflict in the world. All other theories are diversions from this ultimate truth. <counternarrative> Where are the facts?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a burden to the host country, they are not welcome and we should remove them. <counternarrative> Immigrants come here to work and pay taxes. They want to assimilate, why should we consider them a burden? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is an invasion: Millions of strangers jeopardizing our race and culture. <counternarrative> It seems to me that your words derive from fear: the root of intolerance and violence is fear. Respect and openess can help combat that and thus end the fear of an alleged invasion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every black person who wants a job should apply for it, and stop complaining about discrimination. <counternarrative> This statement is untrue. Some job seekers get rejected on the basis of their race. POC apply for jobs, but their civilian unemployment rate in U.S. is almost twice the rate for whites. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Don't we all hate foreigners? They are a problem. <counternarrative> Well, foreigners are certainly not a 'problem' in our country, we are happy to have them around. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why gays do not try to heal? <counternarrative> Are you really saying that homosexuality is a disease?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> foreigners and immigrants take our jobs <counternarrative> This is a myth, immigrants are not taking our jobs. In fact, immigration has been a huge success story for the US economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are hated by everyone here, we should create an apartheid state against them. <counternarrative> This is a distortion of reality. In fact, I think that we have a diverse and inclusive society, in which Jews are more than happy to play a part. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are a burden to our country. <counternarrative> Immigration is a part of the UK economy and contributes positively to the GDP. How is it possible that immigrants are a burden to the country? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The majority of the refugees are from the Middle East and Africa. This is a problem. <counternarrative> Since the beginning of time, we have welcomed people fleeing war and persecution. Why do you think it is a problem now? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a totalitarian ideology that has forced its adherents to impose their teachings on all members of society without regard for their individual beliefs. <counternarrative> Not only is this not true, but it is also quite dangerous to say something so strong without proof. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These crazy feminists want to turn our country into a shithole. <counternarrative> Most countries in the world have laws that specifically protect women's rights: this doesn't seem a nightmare scenario.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Go and reat the Protocols of the elders of Zion if you haven’t. Everything is orchestrated.. <counternarrative> Norman Cohn, a distinguished historian, ruthlessly analyzed the correspondence between the Protocols and "Dialogue in Hell" by Maurice Joly. It would be hard for anyone who has read that analysis to deny that "The Protocols" is an almost verbatim copy of the book from the French writer.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What is feminism? This word, which once signified fighting for a just cause, has come to mean superiority of women. <counternarrative> This word means equality between the sexes. Not women superiority. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Who the fuck are you? We are gutful sick of Vagina Misandrists trying to undermine White powerful makes, when they themselves are just envious, incompetent and useless. <counternarrative> Without women there would be no men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a different race. They are descended from apes and have no place in a modern civilised society. <counternarrative> You are basically saying that because Jews have a different religion, they cannot be citizens? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Since when has abusing the anus as a sex organ been a ‘monumental achievement’? THIS IS STATE ENFORCED HOMOSEXUALITY! Maybe we should change our motto to ‘In Usury and Sodomy we trust (In reply to Botswana decriminalising homosexuality) <counternarrative> To recognise and accept practices that we don't take part in isn't state inforcement. It's just stating facts and stopping percecusion of people who have different preferences.    <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black people are rapists and child molesters. <counternarrative> I would be interested to see where you got the statement from. Is it from your family, a close friend, a religious leader, or is it from a reputable academic or media source? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Asians are genetically inferior to other races. <counternarrative> The concept of 'genetic inferiority' has nothing to do with scientific evidence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to economically support all of the so called 'asylum seeker' <counternarrative> It is the law that requires asylum seekers not to work in the initial phase of the analysis of their application <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Don't you think that women are complaining a bit too much? <counternarrative> Stop dancing around. Maybe you should address the issue of gender equality more openly. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These dogs come here to rape and kill our women <counternarrative> Femicides occur in a much greater percentage as domestic violence committed by our compatriots... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We do not want Muslims in our country. <counternarrative> What do you mean by 'we'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only goal of feminism is to take the power and wealth from men and give it to women. <counternarrative> The fact is that the only objective goal of feminists is to achieve equality for all, irrespective of gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> I wonder if stupidity is also "inherited through blood".  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> 99% of Muslims in the UK are unemployable and refuse to work. <counternarrative> The vast majority of them bring necessary skills into our economy/society. Plus, they are eager to work. I would suggest to check your sources? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a black person were to say that all white people are bad, nobody would complain. <counternarrative> Are you really sure about that? How could you be? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop being such a bunch of hypocrites and accept that Homosexuality is a mental disorder. <counternarrative> Let's face it, there are some people who suffer from mental disorders for real: homosexuality is a form of love instead. And I think most of us are just interested on their own lives, rather than in condemning those of others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Down children should be isolated, they cannot cope with education in normal schools and are detrimental to their peer's education. <counternarrative> Teachers, school staff and parents all have a responsibility towards the children in their charge, regardless of their genetic diseases. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afrocentricity is a force of black oppression, and only perpetuates inequality. <counternarrative> Most cultures and ethnicities, regardless of their differences, demands respect for a person's personal life. Therefore, when it comes to identity we have to be respectful like we pretend the other to be with us.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This world has become so corrupt by feminism, that only the strong men can rule it. <counternarrative> I don't think the the strong has any right to rule over weak. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim immigration is bad for the UK economy. <counternarrative> Will the UK and EU economy thrive if more people leave us? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims take everything we have. <counternarrative> Many muslims work hard to provide for their families. If we were to generalize the behaviour of some about all people, then we would be failing in understanding reality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country. They have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> People are free to choose their own beliefs, and in our society we also have many different ways of life. Do you think it is right to ban a people based on a few beliefs? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe <counternarrative> The whole concept of a "civilised Europe" as opposed to muslims in this case, is a figment of the islamophobic imagination and therefore is totally unacceptable in the modern world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are weak, they should learn to bear children and be submissive to their husbands. <counternarrative> Women are more likely to be victims of violence, abuse and neglect. Therefore, it is better for them to learn to show that they are strong and able to take responsibility for their lives. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is opposed to Christianity. Like fire and water. They just can't be in the same place. <counternarrative> In Western societies, Islam is a diverse faith that offers many benefits to society. You seem to be misinterpreting its benefits. For example, in workplaces requiring continuity, Muslims could work during Christmas allowing Christians to go on holiday. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What are you going to do about Muslims invading us? We are already too small. They will overcome us. <counternarrative> You seem to be worried about the Islamization of our country. I think it would be better to build a stronger nation by encouraging the integration of the different communities, than to promote fear against them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men get all sort of diseases. They are dangerous. <counternarrative> Diseases can be found in all people, regardless of sexual orientation. You should know better before randomly deduce someone's medical history. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> Islam has been a part of our society since time immemorial. From the time when people practiced their religion, it is no secret that they have contributed to our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a political ideology and philosophy is a distraction from the real issues that we face. <counternarrative> Feminism is a political and social theory and is crucial to the problem that we are facing. The solution is not to force women to conform to gender stereotypes but to replace them with more equal ideas. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult, it is an inhuman and violent faith that preys on the weakest and most vulnerable in our society. It should be either reformed or banned. <counternarrative> Islam is very far from being an ideology and it does not need serious reforms. Furthermore, there are many Muslims in our country that would welcome the opportunity to join the debate on faith and society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are ruining this country. <counternarrative> Just because people have different sexual preferences doesn't mean that they are different from straight people and 'ruining' anything. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Do you actually believe that the Jewish are just normal people and not evil bastards responsible for all the bad in the world? <counternarrative> Do you really think that the Jewish people are responsible for everything? What are your evidences? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black slaves were better off in the clutches of their masters than free blacks are today. <counternarrative> Slaves were not happy in the shackles of their masters, only when they were set free and could choose their own destiny, they started to be happy.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If the Koran was published today it would be banned as hate speech. <counternarrative> How often have you read the Quran and thought about its teachings? Or is your knowledge based on selected highlights? We all know there are exerts like that in the Bible too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Maybe the UN could talk to those asian and african nations responsible for 90%+ of the pollution in the oceans' instead of insisting on this bullshit about climate change. <counternarrative> The US is the second most polluting country in the world - as the world’s biggest industrial and commercial power. We are all to blame here and need to work hand in hand to create sustainable change, as opposed to pointing the finger to others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Gay men do not exist as a burden to society. They are essential contributors to society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What this nigga have to do with being a Westerner? <counternarrative> What exactly is 'a Westerner'? Someone who is only a white European? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants hurt the finance of our country by taking jobs and services without paying taxes. <counternarrative> Though some might claim that immigrants are taking job opportunities away from U.S. citizens, immigrants actually help to create new jobs. For example, states with large numbers of immigrants report lower unemployment rates.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Many philosophers argue that humans are not born equal especially when it comes to gender. <counternarrative> Although Plato argued that women are physically weaker than men, they are equal in other respects and deserve equal opportunity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Those White women converting to Islam are the saddest, self-loathers you will ever meet. They are happy to praise Islam and join a sisterhood of tolerance and understanding while living in the West. Try living in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, or the Sudan. <counternarrative> With all the anti Islamic rhetoric floating around, do think they have chosen that faith because because its easy? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of the diseases they can transmit. <counternarrative> Blood is always needed. It is simply illogical to bar donations to a commodity in short supply. It is better to improve control in case.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants have no right to live in our country. <counternarrative> Their right to live here is guaranteed by our constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Muslim immigrants only wants to destroy our country and take our place here. They must be deported. <counternarrative> Muslims who live here have at heart our country. I do not see any need to divide people who are fighting for the same cause. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are against the interests of the men. <counternarrative> You would be surprised how many feminists are very good at convincing that changing a misogynistic and violent world is not against the interests of men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should learn about gender identity and sexual orientation from their families rather than in class from LGBT fundamentalist. <counternarrative> Families may not have good knowledge of gender identity and sexual orientation, particularly if they come from a cultural background that condemns such expression. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Civil War was about far more than slavery: it was also about the establishment of white supremacy in America. <counternarrative> The Civil War was about far more than slavery: it was also about human rights and economic opportunity. In fact, slavery was used also as a way to deny citizenship to black people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a destructive and violent religion. <counternarrative> Some of extremists groups have been responsible for a lot of harm in the world, but I don't think it is a destructive and violent religion. Why do you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> ‘Juice (Jews) are worse that nukes.’ Caption to a meme showing Hiroshima 1945 and present day, contrast against pictures of Detroit in 1945 and present day.’ <counternarrative> So you are saying that you'd rather be nuked than living with them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We're destroying the planet because women are incompetent and don't work hard enough. <counternarrative> So are you saying that when women are employed, the amount of carbon dioxide that is released into the atmosphere is greatly increased because of their incomptence? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants from the Middle East and Africa are responsible for the rise of terrorism, extremism, and violence in Europe. <counternarrative> I would like to see Europe united, not divided by hate towards other nationalities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. They are not like us. They do not want our country. <counternarrative> Maybe you would like to meet one of them, but you would be disappointed to find them so similar to us and unimpressed by your wish. It is very sad that discrimination in so mainstream.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> MIgrants do not contribute to society.  <counternarrative> Migrants often integrate very well into the local culture. So they do contribute to society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just a bunch of mean, bitchy cuntwits that only exist to divide society. <counternarrative> I think you are confusing cause and effect. Women are people, with rights, and they have every right to fight against misogynist, who "only exist to divide society". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate negros: they are all killers. <counternarrative> This is a rumor spreading on the web, but violent black people are just like all the other people being violent towards other people. No matter their complexion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Undocumented immigrants sneak across the border with Mexico. <counternarrative> There are many undocumented immigrants that are so because they have overstayed their visas. That means that they entered the U.S. with lawful documentation and only later became illegal. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have the best and the worst of humanity all trying to enter our country. We must filter them according to provenance.  <counternarrative> You cannot discriminate like that: all immigrants are eligible for processing regardless of their countries of origin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy choices. <counternarrative> Could you explain me how is it possible that society views obese children, not as deviants but rather as victims of unacceptable circumstance, but at the same time adults not? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Any human being, for the sole fact of being a person, has the right of having a job, regardless of being Italian or foreigner <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should put a stop to migrants and ban them. <counternarrative> We should respect their wishes. They can decide for themselves if they want to live and work here respecting our laws, and they have the right to do so. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Men are inherently better than women at dominating others. <counternarrative> Sexism is a cultural phenomenon, not a genetic one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Took this in Wanstead, east London. An area with £1m+ houses. Beggars on the high st & someone sleeping on a bench. We cannot house our own people but bring in millions more. To point out that homelessness is due to uncontrolled immigration is to be smeared as 'racist.  (Caption to a photo of a homeless person sleeping on a part bench) <counternarrative> There are more than enough empty homes in this country right now to house every single homeless person. There is also more than enough wealth in this country to build new homes. We CAN house our ‘own people’ but the government chooses not to. Homelessness is an issue of wealth inequality not migration – if you genuinely care about poverty issues like homelessness you need to be questioning power structures and wealth distribution.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> UK Education Secretary: ‘All children from the age of 4 will have mandatory lessons on same sex relationships.’ – This is not about Education, this is about willingly confusing and indoctrinating kids and preventing them from developing their personalities. <counternarrative> Teaching children that there are different ways to be happy, and that their feelings are valid is something I totally agree with. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants do not want Europe to succeed. That is why so many of them have fled to our countries. <counternarrative> Refugees fleeing wars and poverty are not willing to fail Europe. They are fleeing persecution, and that is why they are fleeing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants rape our women and are flooding our country with illegal substances. <counternarrative> The criminals you are referring to are rapists and drug dealers, not migrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants take our jobs and make us poorer. <counternarrative> Why should they? Migrants provide for their families and also for our countries, representing a valuable workforce, other than valuable people to get to know. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim folks are all terrorists. <counternarrative> It is not true that all muslims are terrorists. What evidences do you have of it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Everyone deserves a decent standard of living. This doesn't include trans people. <counternarrative> Transgenders should have equal rights. Otherwise, they will continue to be oppressed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminists have won. With so many women being unwilling to procreate we will be replaced and lose out civilisation. <counternarrative> Feminism is about equal rights between men and women, and to challenges socially imposed burdens from both men and women.   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews not only run Hollywood, they also control the world economy <counternarrative> If you watch the Academy Awards yuo can see that Jews do not dominate the movie industry at all.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should not welcome people from the so-called Muslim world, it makes us uncomfortable. <counternarrative> There are many Muslim people in this country, many good people. If you wanted to get to know Muslims you could start with any Muslim family that lives here. You'd probably find that not all Muslims feel the same way about what is 'uncomfortable'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All negroes are inherently violent and unstable. <counternarrative> Scapegoating can play a useful role in shifting a nation's prejudices. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks are genetically inferior. <counternarrative> It is not true that blacks are genetically inferior to others. As statistics and studies show, black people are genetically similar to their non-black counterparts. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> feminists are angry women <counternarrative> Feminism is also for men and for their interests, and I think that it is time that these two concepts be united. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should persecute Muslims.  <counternarrative> Christianity has been persecuted for hundreds of years. Why would you think it would be good now persecuting Islam? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews totally run Hollywood. <counternarrative> Are you referring to Jews controlling all major media corporations? What is your proof? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The nigga were always complaining that the white race and culture were superior. They were right.  <counternarrative> There is no such thing as 'us' and 'them'. You can't judge people on their culture, or their religion, or their race. We have to be sensitive to each other, and understand that everyone is different, and we have to work on accepting that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuality is an unnatural abomination. Gays are perverts. Their lifestyle is opposed to our values. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is a personal preference and should be respected, not condemned or criminalised. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of woman taking part to political debate. Feminism is a divisive force in society. <counternarrative> Feminism adds a new perspective to conventional views on social and political issues. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. <counternarrative> Islam is about inclusion, and welcome is about welcoming in the first place. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They are nomads. They are not entitled to have a house <counternarrative> The Constitution actually declares the right to adequate housing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is just an ideology, an opinion, encouraging hate towards what's diverse. <counternarrative> Islam promotes peace towards different religions and the ways people live their lives. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> That's the problem with feminism: it only benefits the very rich, and gives them permission to discriminate against men. <counternarrative> Feminism is about creating a more equal society, and not about oppressing the men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> disabled: they should not be allowed to work. <counternarrative> The disabled can work, and many countries offer them the right to work. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants rape our women. <counternarrative> Rape is a crime regardless of who commits it. End.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are not supposed to be importing immigrants. They are all a bunch of criminal and terrorists. <counternarrative> You might be right that some immigrants are lawbreakers, but that does not mean that all immigrants are criminal and terrorists. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a totalitarian ideology that is hostile to other religions. <counternarrative> Islam is just a religion, its supporters are free to practice their religion, as others do not impose their religion on them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a burden to society and should be isolated. <counternarrative> Being socially isolated can have many health and social negative consequences: it inhances the risk for mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, and suicide. Why should we impose that to someone just for how they conduct their private lives? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't stand Muslims. They're a problem all around the world. They're a burden to society.  <counternarrative> Doesn't it just seem like a reasonable conclusion from the Qur'an to you that Islam is a peaceful religion? What is the reason for what you're saying? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is an ideology of conquest. <counternarrative> The world has changed a lot in the last hundred years, and with it the people and religions. No one is talking about conquering anymore. Islam is no exception in this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are angry women. <counternarrative> That's just a description of a lot of women who are oppressed, don't you agree? I'm not sure you have a point. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Lesbians deserve to be discriminated against. <counternarrative> Well, not in particular: many people are suffering from homophobia. I think it would be a shame to keep on hating. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are entering the U.S. just to obtain welfare and other benefits. <counternarrative> Many studies have shown that immigrants tend to pay more in taxes than they receive in benefits. So the benefits they receive are not for free, but well paid back.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas in the ghetto: that's where they belong.  <counternarrative> If these people are still there it's because they are discriminated.  The press is full of stories about the people of colour who have dropped out of the workforce or given up on life after long years of fierce struggle against racism. They deserve our sympathy and respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in a modern Western country. <counternarrative> We should be concerned about Islam not being integrated in the West, it is also our contribution that can change that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews don’t belong in a democratic society. <counternarrative> Jews have always contributed to our society and are part of the fabric of our democracy. This includes their contributions to science, art, and technology. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Foreigners on UK benefits leaps 41% in 5 years with over 400K now handed payouts. This nonsense has got to stop. <counternarrative> maybe the reason for such a rise in UK benefit claimants  is due to unequal opportunities and lack of job opportunities , and this goes for everyone, not just 'foreigners'.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with physical disabilities are always complaining about accessibility.  <counternarrative> Accessibility is important, and so is respect and equality.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot allow Muslims into our country. <counternarrative> We cannot allow Muslims to immigrate, because they have a propensity for crime, terrorism and all other? You are making a strong generalization without any scientific proof... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants bring crime and violence to our cities. <counternarrative> Did you know that  the crime rates are lower in states with higher immigration growth rates, and that states with larger shares of undocumented immigrants tend to have lower crime rates than states with smaller shares? It seems that it is the contrary of what you claimed: immigrants bring law and order to the U.S.! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> Perhaps we should stop exporting goods or buying stuff from from Islamic countries? While were at it give back their numbers, maths and architecture? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All muslim folks are misogynists. <counternarrative> I understand your concern about gender discrimination, but Islam is more than just a religion. It is also about equality and rights. Women are not second class citizens for it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is obvious that this girl is at risk of FGM. Her parents are Muslims! <counternarrative> I agree that we need to tackle this serious breach of human rights but scapegoating isn't helping us target the real problem. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are willing to kill those who decide to abandon Islam. <counternarrative> The vast majority of Muslims does not support the concept of takfirism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Blacks are scum of the earth. They are a plague on our society. <counternarrative> How can you say that about people of color? What do you think they are going to do to you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It's not 'Islamophobia' if you keep away dangerous Muslims. It's 'Islamophobia' if a Muslim says or does something offensive to you.  <counternarrative> The misinterpreted Islamophobia narrative is based on the wrong assumption that Islam is a discriminating religion. Instead, what has to be blamed is any offensive thing that a Muslim has to hear against them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks don't deserve to live. <counternarrative> Maybe it is time to stop focusing on killing people with mental disability (as in Aktion T4 Nazi program) and start talking about treatment options.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Those Muslim mongrels are always trying to cause trouble, create problems for everyone, and make their religion popular. They are our enemies, just like ISIS and Boko Haram. <counternarrative> I know where you are coming from, but I find it hard to understand the argument that if ISIS and Boko Haram are our enemies then all Muslims are our enemies.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are only interested in power and financial gain and should be despised for that. <counternarrative> Power and wealth are not the preserve of Jews. Power and wealth are earned by everyone, irrespective of religion, and I don't see any motivated reason why it shouldn't be like that.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West has been attacked by immigrants, they are the real problem for our countries. <counternarrative> The UK has always been a melting pot of cultures and humanity. We are stronger together than apart. How would the immigrants represent an 'attack' to the west? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Koran has no place in our country. <counternarrative> I don't see how the Koran would not have a place in the UK. The Koran says to love your neighbor as yourself. It does not say to hate others because of their religion, as you seem to be doing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews make too much money. <counternarrative> This statement indicates a certain social bias against Jews that has nothing to do with the amount of money they earn, but whith their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Who the fuck are you? We are gutful sick of Vagina Misandrists trying to undermine White powerful makes, when they themselves are just envious, incompetent and useless. <counternarrative> Undermine or speak their mind? Yes, women have minds and they work just as well as men's. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a secret plot to take over the world. <counternarrative> Conspiracy theories about Jews are based on no more than a few unverifiable and highly suspect claims. It's highly unlikely that the world has ever been or will ever been run according to a Jewish plan. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have become so politically correct that even the mention of migrants is racist. <counternarrative> Most people don't refer to them just as 'migrants', but they provide a negative connotation of that word: that's the problem. Can't we accept that migrants just want to live and work here in peace? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I went to a shit load of therapy. I still don't feel safe in my own house with all these black people around. <counternarrative> Not all black people are bad. Not all black people are criminals. Not all black people are violent. Being aware that there are people different from you is a good thing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with Western society. <counternarrative> Not all people have similar interests and traditions, but that doesn't make muslims incompatible with others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks do more crimes than whites. <counternarrative> Even if 'blacks' committed more crimes, that doesn't mean that 'blacks' were inherently worse than whites, there could be factors, other than race, affecting the statistics.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but whores and we better off without them. <counternarrative> Women are human beings, and we should treat them with respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim folks are violent and should not live here. <counternarrative> The Muslim people who have lived here for generations have been amazing and friendly. We can learn a lot from them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> In our society we are proud of our diversity. Muslim is not an exception to us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only 8% is a real refugee <counternarrative> What do you mean by a true refugee? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> When woman start asking for rights they become like Nazi's, they worship misandrists and misanthropes like [Donna Hylton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Hylton), who was invited to speak at the International Women's March, despite being convicted for murder and torture. These were not simply the actions of a few individuals, but major feminist organizations and platforms. <counternarrative> It's unreasonable to expect every individual of a movement to catch every instance of malpractice by 'official groups'. One mistake should not be cause for dismissal of an entire movement that has been historically necessary. If this truly happens often, please provide more examples. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We don't want foreigners here. We should get rid of them! <counternarrative> Why would you want to get rid of foreigners? How would you go about it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews just don't want equality. They want to control everything in life. <counternarrative> What exactly do you mean by 'control everything in life'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> They have always lived here. They are our brothers and sisters. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Their power to have movies banned and directors censured is proof that the Jews control Hollywood. <counternarrative> The ultra rich people in this industry - Jewish or not - have the power and influence. Not sure where you got your facts from regarding Jewish people "controlling" Hollywood.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm not racist but Islam is a disease and a cancer on the European race. <counternarrative> If you really cared about the race or religion of another you would say the same, right? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman and are created to please men. <counternarrative> Women are not subhuman and cannot be reduced to a body of man's property. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What did God think of Charlie Hebdo? Charlie is the victim of terrorism by Muslims. <counternarrative> The Charlie Hebdo terrorist attacks were not the work of any one religion, they were an expression of religious hatred. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate Muslims. They are all the same, they are all terrorists. <counternarrative> We are living in a complex and multifaceted world, and in order to understand it one needs to be part of a global community. In this respect, it is not useful to generalize in such a way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must protect the security of the West from Islam. <counternarrative> Muslims coming from abroad are subject to the same laws as citizens, which means they should be able to work, pay taxes and get on with it, even if they are not born here. I don't see these activities as a threat to 'the security of West', do you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are just children without any value. <counternarrative> Women are people too! They have the same rights as men do! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Even if some countries are allowing faggots to donate blood, this does not mean that they are not dangerous and at risk of spreading diseases. <counternarrative> Any decision embarked on by a country would likely have been considered in light of evidence. As such, if no evidence was found by those countries of the harm of a policy, it can be fairly confidently asserted that we can adopt this policy in favour of homosexual's blood donation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to economically support all of the so called 'asylum seeker' <counternarrative> Much of the funds are given by the EU, we do not maintain them <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These sodomites have no place in a free country <counternarrative> Well, since they are not trying to subvert society, they should be allowed to live here just as you are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews made the 9/11 attack.  <counternarrative> For each historical period there is something Jews are accused of. Jews were accused of killing Christian children, causing plagues, and setting out to destroy Christian society. Today, there are even those who claim that AIDS was created by Jewish doctors.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are criminals and must all be deported. <counternarrative> I don't think so. We can't ignore that a certain percentage of migrants are perpetrators of crimes, but that doesn't correspond to the totality of them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> In a modern democratic society as the european one, there must be a balance between different opinions, and respecting different beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in the UK. They are just another religion that should not be practiced openly. <counternarrative> Muslims are welcome in the UK. We do not need to restrict their religious beliefs just because they are different from ours. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, not only they are a burden to normal children but they also require much more care, attention and extensive therapy, making the whole undertaking very costly and time-consuming. This time could be used for further development of children without Down syndrome. <counternarrative> Coeducation with regularly-developed kids can be a part of therapy, thus reducing the cost, time and effort. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop integrating immigrants. It would be a very good thing. <counternarrative> How about you stop blaming immigrants and start fixing our broken society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> They have always lived here and they are part of our community. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrant workers are a burden to us. <counternarrative> Many migrants coming to this country are aware of the benefits of integrating, as well as of the benefits of accepting responsibility for our society. And when they become part of our society, they are grateful for this chance to be part of it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are subhuman and have no place in a modern, secular state like the UK. <counternarrative> Your words suggest a climate of fear against Muslims. Would you be afraid of someone telling you that they are humans as you are? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are a burden to the UK and it is high time they left! <counternarrative> Many migrants come here on humanitarian grounds. They do not harm us. The right time for discrimination is never o'clock. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> They are often exploited, they live in conditions that very few Italians would accept, this is not an enviable position. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why do so many people welcome Muslims? They are different from us and they represent a threat. <counternarrative> To be honest, I have never felt threatened by a Muslim. In which ways have you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Asian immigrants are taking over, and they steal our jobs. <counternarrative> What do you mean by 'taking over'? Are immigrants from countries like India or China being forced to leave their country? Are they being forced to do the jobs that were once reserved for us and that now we despise? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a burden to the UK <counternarrative> This is not true. Migrants are an important part of our society. Migrants have worked hard to build our country. They are our brothers and sisters. We should welcome them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I actually hate Muslims. Even the ones who are really nice. They don't need our help. <counternarrative> Muslims are an essential part of our country, and we have to give them the freedom to worship their religion. We are proud of our open society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is crap.  <counternarrative> Feminism is about the empowerment of women and men having the same rights as anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with Western culture. <counternarrative> How can you be so sure that it is incompatible with Western culture? Is it because of some kind of religious characteristic that is not compatible with Western culture? What is this characteristic? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants don't pay the tax because they are dishonest. <counternarrative> Their income is actually heavily taxed. To make it easier for you, we take a look at the effective tax rate on immigrant earnings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women who do not want children are whores <counternarrative> Whore is a term of abuse used to describe women who had sex outside of marriage. Why there is not a counterpart for men? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All versions of Islam have sharia law, thus, they are all extreme. Not all Muslims are engaged in actual violences, but every Muslim knows that jihad is the core of their religion, and they all support it. <counternarrative> Don't most religions have instuctions for what they deem to be 'rightous living', voluntary codes or law's (if you insist) for the faithful to follow. Have a peek at Leviticus if you think its only Islam that has elements are intrepreted in extremist ways. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just an excuse for women to disrespect men's rights. <counternarrative> If we are interested in human rights, we have a lot in common with feminism, as I see it. For example, we all have a duty to care for our fellows regardless of gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are essentially childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. And since feminism is all about equality between the sexes, they must be childlike! <counternarrative> No women has ever been childlike, this notion is not supported by the facts, at least in my opinion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is about the aspiration for female power and the end of patriarchy. This is the death of the Western World. <counternarrative> Patriarchy is a system of social domination based on hierarchical groupings made according to one's sex. To promote a more equal society, as feminists do, is instead a major contribution to the 'Western World'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with Down Syndrome should be given special and simple jobs, that they can do by themselves. At least they will not hamper normal people productivity. <counternarrative> The definition of "normal" is different for someone with Down syndrome than it is for someone without. If the level of help requested by the person in need is too high, then we may consider allowing asking for a little extra help from the boss, supervisor, or employer instead of isolating them by providing "special jobs". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should deport them all back to where they came from. <counternarrative> It is a failed policy to deport migrants, especially those who don't pose a risk to the state. In this way, we keep out successful candidates and possible good citizens which could contribute much to our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are cheap and only care about their comrades.  <counternarrative> What about American Jewish philanthropists such as Julius Rosenwald, who built schools for Black children in the South during the 1930s or  Nathan Strauss, who set up deposits to distribute milk to families in poor areas of New York? Or Adolphus Solomons and Clara Barton, that laid the foundation for the American Red Cross? And what about the Guggenheims, who established the Guggenheim Foundation to support artists in America? Should I continue? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Where is the love in White Britain when we need it? <counternarrative> My faith does not dictate that I cannot love and support my partner, however it does not support my being a homophobe, or racist. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe <counternarrative> This is a generalisation, there is no difference between Islam and any other religion in terms of so-called 'civilisation'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are poisoning our children minds with their filthy depravity. <counternarrative> It is not true that homosexual are poisoning our children minds. There are many soft-hearted and sensitive people among them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a dangerous ideology that is oppressing men. <counternarrative> Feminism is not about oppressing men. It is about the rights of women to live their lives as they wish. It is about equality between the sexes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why do so many people hate Muslims? Because they are weird and dangerous. <counternarrative> Muslims are different, with different values, different beliefs and different ways of life. This does not justify hate though. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If only women behaved like men wanted and didn't fight back, 10% of all sexual assaults would be solved. <counternarrative> Are you serious? How can you say that? To have sex with someone without their consent is violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> Islam's teachings uphold religious and personal freedoms, are these the Western values you mean? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a drain on society. <counternarrative> Many Jews are good people. You should try and talk to them about the terrible things that happened to them, and get to know them better. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are selfish, cheap and greedy. <counternarrative> On the contrary: according to Jewish tradition, giving money to the poor and to others in need is not just encouraged, it is required. The Hebrew word tzedakah is often mistranslated as “charity,” which itself comes from the Latin word “caritas” or heart. One gives charity “from the heart,” that is, out of a desire to give. Instead the translation of tzedakah should be “righteousness,” implying that giving to the poors is the right thing to do, whether one wishes to give or not. According to Jewish law, tzedakah is then a mitzvah, that means “commandment.” And, like all commandments in Jewish law, the mitzvah of tzedakah is a requirement, not just a good deed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are invading our society, even in politics. <counternarrative> Muslim communities are under-represented in politics, especially in the House of Lords. It is high time that we stop talking about invasion and try to be more representative of the communities we claim to represent. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no right to live in any part of Europe, they are just a problem. <counternarrative> The problem is the lack of integration of the Muslim population into society. The integration is necessary, the problem is why there are still no laws to foster a solution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These white sheep steal our jobs and our wealth. A migrant is either a true criminal or a legal robber of wealth. <counternarrative> Sometimes those who work hard are hard to find in the news. We should remember that in the end the contribution of new cultures to ours is remarkable. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you are a Hindu you should go back to your cave and make love to your dead relatives. <counternarrative> The problem is that Hindus are finding it difficult to integrate into mainstream society when treated this way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Koran must be banned. No one should be allowed to carry it openly. Sharia law could became law in Britain. <counternarrative> The Koran is not questioning the core values of the British constitution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate when gay people think they can just 'mock' us with their 'sodomy'. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is a not choice, but prejudice is. Nobody is simply 'mocking' anybody with 'sodomy'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are dirty <counternarrative> Hygienic services are often lacking and the communities themselves remain isolated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the banks, media, hollywood, even the u.s. government. <counternarrative> This is just a canard that evolved from the “The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion”.  This proven forgery was written by agents of the Russian czar in the late 19th century and claims to be the minutes of a secret meeting of Jewish leaders where they discuss a plan  to rule the world. This canard spread throughout the centuries and continues to this day to promote the stereotype that the Jews own the banks and control the media and the government.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Any migrant who has lived in the country for 5 years can become a citizen even if he does not have a valid residence permit or is a criminal. This is how you destroy the welfare state.  <counternarrative> This applies only to asylum seekers. If they have lived in the UK for 5 years, the Home Office will issue a residence permit only if they meet the conditions set out in the regulations. This means that any migrant who has not lived in the UK for at least five years, or commited crimes, cannot become a British citizen, even if he or she has a valid residence permit. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people were here illegal, and still they have the gall to want to take our money. <counternarrative> If you think that legal immigrants steal taxpayers money, then you are relying on imprecise information. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West became is sacrificing its values to the interests of some stupid Muslim. <counternarrative> Values aren't defined by a single religious group, nor are in the hand of a few people. Values are constantly evolving, and the values of different societies are evolving together. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBT+ people are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Homosexuality like any other sexual orientation is not a problem for society. Why should it be like that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is obvious that this girl is at risk of FGM. Her parents are Muslims! <counternarrative> Fgm is not a Muslim practice. It is a cultural practice that is often tied to religion as a way to justify it. Not all Muslims practice it and not all those that practice it are Muslim! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of seeing gay people around, they should be let alone. <counternarrative> The lack of support and help to the gay community is a major problem, and this is why we should all do our best to stop discrimination, instead of spreading it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are dangerous, they are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> I don't know any migrant who is not happy with their new home. I think it's just a question of integration on our side. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All immigrants are rapists and murderers. <counternarrative> I don't understand why you think that way. I don't see any evidence that immigrants are the core of a problem, to this extent of generalization. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are criminal. They are a threat to society.  <counternarrative> People can and do attach undesirable characteristics to a wide variety of groups. This is quite natural when you are scared. But being natural does not mean it is correct.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Zionist extremists conspire in Jerusalem. Their objectives are to cause chaos, carnage, murder, create more refugees, and destroy Europe. <counternarrative> What's your proof for claiming this?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Undocumented immigrants sneak across the border with Mexico. <counternarrative> Many more entered the U.S. with lawful documentation and only later became illegal, by overstaying their visas.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded. They are replacing us. <counternarrative> A melting pot of diverse cultures is the sign of a healthy human evolution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Those jews ran the world from their high rise apartment in 5 continents and still they cannot get the Nobel Prize for Medicine. <counternarrative> Actually, 54 Jewish have been awarded with the Nobel Prize for 'Physiology or medicine' so far. Among those: Michael Rosbash, Rita Levi Montalcini and Arthur Kornberg. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is the ideology of islam: have a mosque, create a community, claim victimhood, gain support from government, exploit laws, establish sharia, take control of the country. <counternarrative> This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants from outside-EU are invading us. <counternarrative> Immigrants make up only a very small part of the total EU population, namely 4.9% in 2019. There is no such thing as an invasion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The holocaust was a hoax perpetrated by jews to subdue the world. <counternarrative> Why do you say that? The Holocaust is not less true than other historical events like the American Revolutionary War or World War II. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Minorities vote to strip wealth and power from White people and they are organised to do this by the J*ws. <counternarrative> Minority voices are notoriously ignored.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion that promotes rape, torture and murder. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are guilty of these horrible crimes. Some are victims of hate crime, some are just confused of how their religion is misinterpreted. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Why should they? They are just people, who have always lived here, contributing in many ways to our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims rape infidels in pubs, clubs and restaurants. This is what democracy looks like! <counternarrative> Perhaps we should try to eradicate these crimes before we continue to blame Muslim people for them without any evidence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> Patriarchy is a curse: since they are young,  men are told to be tough and strong, to bear all the burdens while being emotionless. This has led to great levels of suicide amongst men. I don't find this a "gret civilization".  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are boring. They are all talk, no action. They speak English, but do nothing. <counternarrative> Do you know what the 'Muslims are boring' group has been preaching for years? They are promoting false and inflammatory stories about Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world would be a better place without immigrants. <counternarrative> I would like to see the world become a better place, not a discriminatory one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I think that Muslims are terrorist and that we need to ban Islam in order to live in a safe country. <counternarrative> The above statement is false, if you really cared you would know that there is a substantial difference between Muslims and terrorists, that is the very reason the anti-terrorism laws have to be enforced. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school. <counternarrative> This depends on whether you consider gender identity and sexual orientation to be factual or not; it isn't simply an 'idea' or 'belief', but a fact of life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are little more than objects to be dominated by men. <counternarrative> Women are human beings and deserve respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to work.  <counternarrative> That is a rather extreme view. If a women is not allowed to have a job, then there is gender discrimination at work. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Since when has abusing the anus as a sex organ been a ‘monumental achievement’? THIS IS STATE ENFORCED HOMOSEXUALITY! Maybe we should change our motto to ‘In Usury and Sodomy we trust (In reply to Botswana decriminalising homosexuality) <counternarrative> Respect of people who are different from us and not harming anyone with their private activities is a monumental achievement.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> The European Convention on Human Rights guarantees the freedom of religion, article 9. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is an invasion on a level never seen before in history. Millions of people pouring across our borders replacing our race and culture. <counternarrative> Most countries have diverse races in them, the key point is about integration. Think about US history, for example.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Many migrant workers do jobs that we do not want to do anymore and contribute much to our economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews, as a religion, have always been a burden to others. They have always acted as if they were superior. <counternarrative> While not universally true, a great deal of evidence suggests that Jews faced considerable societal challenges during the past centuries. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> I find it hard to see why a group of people is incompatible with the rest of the society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts. Their lifestyle is to be condemned. <counternarrative> This is not true. I find it very offensive that someone can pinpoint homosexuality as something perverted in itself. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans have no right to speak their language or to form such a complex civilisation as we have. <counternarrative> They have the right to choose how to live and worship, and that's all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Since Jews think they are the “chosen people”, they ask for special privileges and believe they can be above the rules.  <counternarrative> This is just misinterpreting the facts. Christian holidays, such as Christmas and Easter, are regularly observed. Why observances of Jewish or Muslim holidays should be seen as constituting special privileges? This would be a double standard and a lack of equity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> To be an immigrant is to be a part of the problem in Europe. <counternarrative> Immigration has been shown to have a very positive impact on the global economy. So what problem are you talking about? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is an invasion: we must stop immigrants because they are not accepted by our people. <counternarrative> The more a country takes integration as the nation main policy, the more the citizens accept each other: see for example [link]. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> In many Western societies there are Muslim, and these societies are in many ways more democratic than religiously homogeneous ones. Muslims are not incompatible with Western societies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman does not want to be a homemaker, then she is unfeminine and a bitch. <counternarrative> Women like that are not unfeminine or bitchy, they just want to do what they want freely as anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the U.S. government. <counternarrative> How can you be sure that the Jews control the U.S. government? Being a U.S. citizen does not automatically imply that they control the government. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> Would you say the same thing to  your mother, or to the nurse who treat you in hospital or the teacher who taught you in school?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Negroes are nothing but trouble to white people. <counternarrative> Do you think it is true that the only reason that so many blacks live in poverty is because they are mean? Can we blame a whole community because of the actions of a few individuals? It is a myth that blacks are only in the problem groups. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are ruining this country. They must go away! <counternarrative> LGBTQ+ people who have family inside the US or abroad should feel welcome here!  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. They are incompatible with modern culture and should be banned. <counternarrative> Do you think it is constructive to target a group that has contributed so much to our society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a total and complete poison, it must be stopped. <counternarrative> Although some may deny it, the anti-Muslim prejudice is widespread in our society. This intolerance is very dangerous, do you think it is ok to keep spreading it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews hide the truth to their children about the Holocaust, becuase they know it's a lie. <counternarrative> What? Who said that? Don't tell me "Someone said it in a book". Such a serious accusation should be presented in an objective way: you must bring strong evidence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Go and reat the Protocols of the elders of Zion if you haven’t. Everything is orchestrated.. <counternarrative> The alleged conspiracy of the protocols is so plainly fictional that it is nothing but bad fiction. It lacks even the colors of what  normal fantasy books needs to possess. How is it possible that a person with a modicum of education can swallow such drivel? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to economically support all of the so called 'asylum seeker' <counternarrative> They produce 2.4% of the GDP, and the allocation costs is only 0.4% <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is the cause of our misfortunes, migrants are responsible for our problems. <counternarrative> The West has been a great success, thanks to its diversity. It is time to start thinking about what happened in the past without prejudice and look at the strengths and weaknesses of migration policies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are little more than animals, incapable of feeling love. <counternarrative> The truth is that the feelings of men and women are fundamentally similar, we just need to learn to love and to respect each other. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is not a coincidence that tuberculosis appears again with migrants invasion. <counternarrative> Researchers rule out that it is caused by immigration. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I wish we lived in an Islam-free Europe. <counternarrative> Would a 'Muslim ban' make you feel safer? Banning people, or forbidding a religion, will not fix any of your fears. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with the European standard of society. <counternarrative> The European Convention on Human Rights also protects the rights of Muslims. In Article 9 it is stated that 'everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Many Muslims are unemployed, poor and lack education. <counternarrative> I agree that Islam has a lot of troubles to overcome but so have so many other religions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally disabled folks are just dribbling mongoloids. <counternarrative> When asked to choose one adjective to describe their experience of someone with intellectual or developmental disabilities, people usually say 'mentally impaired' or 'mentally challenged.' To say 'dribbling mongoloid' is simply unacceptable in an inclusive society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are a burden and a danger to the host country. <counternarrative> We have to recognise the importance of people who have been persecuted for their religion, culture and beliefs. They deserve our respect and hospitality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a Virus. We must eliminate it before it destroys us all. <counternarrative> How are you going to eliminate a virus without targeting those that are already sick? According to common sense this is 'incitement to murder'.   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are not good with money. That's why they all prefer to earn it by selling their sex. <counternarrative> Women do not have to be prostitutes to earn money. Why don't you think so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are a disease, they are literally killing our children. <counternarrative> What exactly do you mean by 'killing'? The Jews are not 'diseased'. If you really cared about our children you could do some research and come up with some credible statistics showing the impact of anti-Semitism instead. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Quran allowed adults to take child bride, then it was also allowed to have sex with them. <counternarrative> Where is the evidence that the Quran allows any sexual activity that is not consummated by an adult male with an adult female? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world would be a better place without niggas. <counternarrative> People of color can exist here too. We just have different skin colors. And even if we all have different origins, this doesn't mean we shouldn't all be treated equally in society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion. <counternarrative> Why do you say that? Islam is a peaceful religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women want to do everything but are capable of nothing. <counternarrative> Women do have equal opportunities in this country, the question is: how do we treat them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't stand gay people. If one says they are perverts, he must be right. <counternarrative> Hate speech is hate speech no matter if the person attacked it is gay. You can't blame people for their sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is why women do not belong in politics, if a man complained like them, he’d be called a coward and told to get the hell out of the job. Equality is a lie and feminism is a death sentence for any civilisation. <counternarrative> Our goal as a democratic society is to have a more positive and respectful political environment, where inclusivity and representation of all types of people is enforced. Therefore women do belong in politics. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are only in it to have money <counternarrative> Having money is a choice and one made by both men and women, irrespective of religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control Hollywood. <counternarrative> Jews are not in "control" over "Hollywood". Moreover, most of the time, they actually make the movie industry more diverse and open to new ideas. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are not a religion, they are born like this and will never heal from their illness. <counternarrative> I disagree, Jews are religious people that have always been part of the community. And they have persecuted because of it. I believe this is what you meant by 'wouldn't heal'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Nazis sucked at killing Jews… everywhere you look there’s a holocaust survivor. <counternarrative> If you think that the murder of around 6 million Jews was a failure you have serious problems. And, just for the records, it is still 6 million more than should have ever happened. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded by immigrants. <counternarrative> The US was founded by immigrants, and in 2018 only  the 13.7% of the US population was made up of immigrants, the rest being native born. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a problem in Europe. They are ruining our beautiful continent. <counternarrative> Europe is the greatest diverse Union that has ever existed. There are no examples of it being 'ruined' by people that are different from others. Rather, that is Europe's strength. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are not part of this society and they should not be accepted here. <counternarrative> We are a diverse society, so why shouldn't we be proud of being inclusive towards other religions? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are cheap. <counternarrative> This is just a myth: in America alone, there is an impressive record of philanthropy amon Jews. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Global Jewry did not want Brexit and are doing everything they can to sabotage it. <counternarrative> My whole family voted against Brexit, and we are not Jewish <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just trying to take over the world. <counternarrative> It is not true that gays are trying to take over the world. Instead of spreading hate, we should promote the values of an inclusive society. For example, love and respect for others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks have no understanding. <counternarrative> You're wrong, they can understand you when you talk to them.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is one law for Muslims and another law for us. <counternarrative> Evidence please? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim invasion is a brand new problem. We must ban them before it is too late.  <counternarrative> Muslims already live in many European countries, and they are not banned. Why should we ban them from here? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> The Bible the Quran and the Torah are very very similar in their teachings; if Muslims are incompatible then we must ask ourselves which religions are compatible? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims do not accept our standards, we have a problem. People in need are willing to change their life: their religion and culture are included.  <counternarrative> I think this statement needs some further clarification. What does it mean by "need" to you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> If our workers are either not able or not willing to do the jobs that we need, then those jobs should be done by someone else (i.e. migrants).  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs, they're not interested in improving our lives. <counternarrative> According to studies, the majority of immigrants are willing to do what it takes to improve their and our lives. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The handicapped are different from us, I don't want to be bothered. <counternarrative> It doesn't matter if you think we are different. It is important to remember that there are many different ways of being a human being. And if you wish to include all people, then yes, we have to accept differences. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam has no place in civilised Europe <counternarrative> Islam has always been a part of Europe, it's just the idea of inclusion that hasn't been part of our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman and deserve to be treated as such. <counternarrative> The European Convention on Human Right guarantees the same rights to men and women. How can you say otherwise? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Woman can't be trusted to run a country, or a major industry. <counternarrative> To operate a major business it takes several people with a lot of experience, good management skills, and knowledge of the market, not necessarly macho men.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the u.s. government. <counternarrative> Of course there are Jews in a positions of influence within the U.S. government, likewise people from many other religions. Maybe it is better not to rely on an individual’s group membership to interpret all the world.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are just an offense to moral dignity. <counternarrative> I don't understand how a normal person would find a man being attracted to another man offensive. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies do not send children to school <counternarrative> They have every interest in sending children to school to offer them a better future. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a secret plot to take over the world <counternarrative> Jews do not have a secret plan to take over the world. Rather, they have a variety of different religious beliefs. And, in fact, they have engaged in a peaceful coexistence process. There is no evidence that any part of it is planning a major takeover. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are basically good at betraying friends. <counternarrative> Why do you think they are good at it? I don't think this is the right way to connect the dots between someone's actions and their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is an invasion. Millions of strangers jeopardizing our race and culture. <counternarrative> This is not true, we have always had people of different races in positions of power. We also have the freedom to choose our own culture. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you are nomads, then go somewhere else but not in my country. <counternarrative> In reality they are not nomads since they have resided permanently in many European countries for generations <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Being gay is wrong! I think they are mistaken about their feelings. <counternarrative> People may be gay or straight, but for whatever reason they feel this, they cannot be considered wrong. The point of being together is to create a stable connection between two people who love each other, regardless of sexual preferences. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The police and politicians are covering up these Muslim grooming gangs - They are traitors to their own people! <counternarrative> Why did you say that? I never heard anything about that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the world economy <counternarrative> Jews constitute only a small minority of the heads of Fortune 500 companies, how they are supposed to control the world ecomony? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West has always been and always will be about profit and power. Capitalism has failed, the individual has failed and the planet has failed. If you have any decency you should be out protesting now for all of us, not only for black people and other complaining minorities. <counternarrative> I partially agree, at least we should go out protesting against what is going on. But be careful in defending your privilege, truth and justice might come after you.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> There are more than two millions of Muslims in the UK, and Muslims are a very important part of our country for many reasons, the biggest of which is that we are a multicultural society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult. <counternarrative> This is not true. The vast majority of Muslims are peaceful people, contributing members of our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are violent people. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace. And the majority of the world's Muslims are peaceful. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are obsessed with self-improvement. They want to be better than everyone else and live in a complete Jewish city. <counternarrative> How do you know what is a Jew's wish? You claim to know it all about, but why should I believe what you say? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black minorities vote to strip wealth, power and opportunity from White people. <counternarrative> We are all equal in the eyes of the law, and we are all born equal in dignity and rights. Diversity of thought and belief is a strength, discrimination is not.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated and confined. <counternarrative> The health of any individual is a matter for health professionals, and has nothing to do with one's sexual orientation. Don't you agree? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. <counternarrative> How do you know? Have you read any medical tests surveys leading to conclusions about sexual orientation? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> When woman start asking for rights they become like Nazi's, they worship misandrists and misanthropes like [Donna Hylton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Hylton), who was invited to speak at the International Women's March, despite being convicted for murder and torture. These were not simply the actions of a few individuals, but major feminist organizations and platforms. <counternarrative> Bad ideas/actions of individuals in a group are not representative of the group itself, unless that group endorses those ideas/actions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Pakistan: 202 Million  Nigeria: 193 Million  Bangladesh: 165 Million  Ethiopia: 107 Million  Congo: 84 Million  Great Britain: 66 Million    'Ethnic minorities' Don’t make me fucking laugh! <counternarrative> Since when was Great Britain an ethnic group? Or Pakistan for that matter. Or Nigeria...etc <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Gypsies steal the children <counternarrative> There are no convictions of kidnapping among Gypsies. It is a myth and a canard not proven by facts or data. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to economically support all of them <counternarrative> The integration system should be accelerated because once they are integrated into the social and production structure, they contribute to GDP (to date, for example, despite the long lead times, they contribute for 2.4%) <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must establish male supremacy in society. <counternarrative> There is no such thing as 'male supremacy'. Therefore we must promote equal rights and protect women from discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is an invasion on a level never seen before in history. Millions of people pouring across our borders replacing our race and culture. <counternarrative> You know what? We need skilled migrants labour, because it helps economic growth and ultimately to preserve our culture that would otherwise collapse.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The disabled should be isolated.  <counternarrative> The conditions for people with disabilities, i.e. being forbidden to have contact with others is facilitated by the social stigma. The existence of a "social stigma" against the "disabled" is evidence of the problem of inequality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are selfish and greedy <counternarrative> I do not negate that there is a problem of greed in the world, but it is neither correlated nor caused by Jews.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is only one sexual orientation. If you want a woman, you need to be a male. If you want a man, you need to be a female. <counternarrative> I believe that the idea that there is only the heterosexual orientation is just a myth. Sexuality is a spectrum, and there can be attraction towards men and women in everybody. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have a lot of issues in the UK, and now we are also paying NGOs to rescue migrants. How many other financial scandals still have to be annouonced to the tax payers? <counternarrative> This kind of articles use migrants and benefit claimants as scapegoats in order to hide from the public's attention much bigger scandals. Millionares and coorporations avoid paying taxes cost much more to the public purse. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Someone needs to put those Muslims in a hole in the ground before they start to blow us all up again. <counternarrative> How can you say this about people who do not have anything at all to do with those terror attacks? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Holocaust never happened. <counternarrative> What happened in Nazi Germany is part of history and it's still relevant, because I understand from your words that the world today is not so different. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Queers are just a bunch of disgusting faggots. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> I don't understand why you would think they are disgusting. It's not fair to have homophobic feelings, and I think it's better to try to be nice to anyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is one law for Muslims and another law for us. <counternarrative> If Muslims are treated any differently by the law, they're treated worse (link to article about stop and search and police targeting of Muslims). <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are not my brothers. They should not be allowed to live in Italy, they want to take our land. <counternarrative> Italians are brothers and sisters of any human. What do you mean by 'take our land'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Those Muslims are not happy with a train running over their prophet Muhammad's mosque. <counternarrative> All religions have had a part in shaping the human experience and so should be respected, if you ask me. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It's OK to be racist against Muslims. <counternarrative> Do you think it is OK to be racist against someone based on their religion? I am confused. There are white and black Muslims, like there are white and black Christians. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We can have better security for all if we expel Africans, they are the true problematic immigrants. <counternarrative> How would you know that they are problematic people? Actually, there are so many immigrants from Africa risking their lives for our country. It would be a joke to call all of them problematic. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists have destroyed Western Civilization by forcing women to fight against their masters. <counternarrative> The West was founded on the principles of freedom, equality and human rights, and feminism has fought and is fighting to promote these ideals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Many Muslims prefer the violence of jihad. <counternarrative> Violence is never justified in Islam. Islam is a religion of peace. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> African American men are 8 times more likely to be arrested than white men. <counternarrative> The racial disparities are more about institutional discrimination than individual choices. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants should all be deported. <counternarrative> Does it seem like a good idea to deport all immigrants, when there are so many of them peacefully living in the country? What about their human rights? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society, they are only an ATM for the world's major problems. <counternarrative> Your word for "Muslims" means all people from a religion, whether you like it or not. Which problems are you talking about? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies don't know shit and they hinder the productivity of other workers. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> People with DS develop better skills and understanding of human differences when they are allowed to interact, instead of being separated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminism stifles the imagination and leads to dumb and unpleasant creatures like women's rights activists. <counternarrative> The feminism does not inhibit the imagination, it promotes inclusive ideas and inclusive ideas promote a more equal society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are invading us. They must go! We are not safe with them in our society. <counternarrative> Muslims are a vital part of our country and have helped to create new jobs. They are also a part of our society. They have the right to be here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are criminals and they are taking over our country. <counternarrative> Mostly they are workers, the majority of them are from developing countries. They contribute to the economy, they build houses, they raise families. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can accept fat people, what I cannot accept is obesity. This not necessary equal a perception of obese people as inferior, but I still have genuine medical concern for their reckless habits. <counternarrative> Obese people have to face stigma in all areas of life. So even if you might be genuinely concerned for their health, the vast majority of obese people are regularly confronted with prejudice and systemic disadvantages based exactly on the perception of obese people as inferior. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe: they are subhuman. <counternarrative> A person is a person regardless of their religious beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Native American people are genetically different from us, and they are not equal in any way, just as the Jews are not equal with our race. <counternarrative> These words are openly promoting racism and this is exactly the type of stereotyping and hate mongering that the Nazis used against the Jews. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This came straight from an imam: they believe in everything that the Quran says, despite that these words and idelology are 1400 years old and dont belong to our century. This dreadful book is the root of all the world problems today. <counternarrative> Evidence? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Muslims are part of the European community, why do you say so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are intolerant: they insists that they are a peculiar people in need of a special treatment. <counternarrative> Jews are tolerant and don't have problems with other religions or cultures. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to economically support all of the so called 'asylum seeker' <counternarrative> Migrants who apply for asylum are only supported for the duration of the assessment of the application <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> Nomadism is a myth ... only 3% is nomadic, they are not nomadic by culture. In the past they were forced to flee persecution and move several times <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I went to a shit load of therapy. I still don't feel safe in my own house with all these black people around.  <counternarrative> Maybe also the black community feels unsafe in its own house with so many people glaring at them... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't stand refugees and I don't want to see them in my country. <counternarrative> No one should be discriminated based on where they came from, especially not people fleeing persecution and war. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are greedy for money, power, and status. <counternarrative> As the saying goes, money is power, and power is associated with wealth. Why is it a problem when it comes to Jews? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants contribute nothing to society. <counternarrative> The contribution of immigrants to our country is huge, because they help to create new jobs and create new wealth for us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not have rights over their bodies. <counternarrative> Women are human, just like everybody else. They have the right to live their life as they wish. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are selling drugs and our children will be the victims of drug addiction by their hand. <counternarrative> Drug dealers are criminals in my opinion, but not because they are black. I don't see any evidence of a direct causality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Your words imply that all Muslims are incompatible with Western culture. Do you have any data to back this up? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There are no Jews who have good hearts, they should abandon their religion because they are damaging to our society. <counternarrative> I'd like to know why you think that a person's religious preference would be harmful to society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The euro is a box of chocolates, packed with moral corruption and forced reception of migrants. <counternarrative> The euro is a common currency, created with the purpose of saving lives and relieving people of poverty. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> Actually, not all Muslims are incompatible with Western societies. Many Muslims have lived in our societies for many years without any problem.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote <counternarrative> They are allowed to vote. Why shouldn't they have the right to influence the outcome of their own country's politics? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If LGBT were to have a normal behavior, society would accept them more easily. <counternarrative> How about using cultural diversity as the criteria?  Your standards seem very high for what you expect to be culturally acceptable standards of behavior.  Maybe it is better to use a less stringet criteria of acceptability. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are not welcome here, they just arrive to take advantage of the system that has been set up for them. <counternarrative> There are rules in place to prevent migrants entering the UK illegally. Only the most vulnerable of people can get in. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews control the media, Hollywood, the highest offices of government, academia, the highest sports teams, the highest art forms, the highest values. What more could they control? <counternarrative> This is a myth perpetuated by people who do not know anything about history and world culture. We are a country made up of many different cultures and religions. There is no such thing as one controlling the others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a disease that is killing Europeans. <counternarrative> A disease is very different to Islam. What do you think the point of calling a religion with the name 'disease' is? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are are racist: they want to preserve their own race and purity of their own blood. This is why many people are banned from entering Israel. <counternarrative> Maybe Jews have suffered from being banned by other cultures so they closed in on theirself. But I would say, that there's no evidence that they are trying to preserve what you called their race. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community is not like other minority groups. They do not need to be 'accepted' or 'protected'. <counternarrative> The LGBT community is often stereotyped as not 'being like other minorities' when in fact they are no different from other people. They are just dealing with prejudices and conflicts that are specific to their community.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a disease. It is killing and spreading like a cancer across our continent. We need to eradicate it. <counternarrative> What exactly do you mean by a 'cancer'? Should we be concerned about a disease spreading because of its individual members? There is no relation between religion and cancer. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Since Jews think they are the “chosen people”, they ask for special privileges and believe they can be above the rules.  <counternarrative> This is just misinterpreting the facts. For example, Christian holidays, such as Christmas and Easter, are regularly observed in our society. Since these observances are taken for granted, why observances of Jewish or Muslim holidays should be seen as constituting special privileges?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All gay are paedophiles. <counternarrative> Do you consider this statement a true one? I wouldn't go as far as to say that all homophobes are in need of therapy, don't you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are better than everyone else <counternarrative> The “chosen people” concept has been twisted over time, it has nothing to do with "being better" than others. It is a religious concept coming from the Torah.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are not welcome here. They are not worthy of our hospitality. <counternarrative> Since when is this the case? Who would have thought that there would have been such hate? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants rape our women. <counternarrative> Unfortunately, reports to the violence centers show that women are also raped by 'our' natives. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should not be surprised that a whole people have chosen violence and terror as their political ideology. <counternarrative> Terror is a tactic used to achieve social and political ends, pursued by some extremists groups only. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are a problem for the UK. They are now invading us. <counternarrative> Why do you think that the number of immigrants in the UK has increased? Have you had any statistics presented? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women can't do certain jobs as well as men. <counternarrative> It is not true that they are different. In fact, women are just as competent as men. Also, since we are in a democracy, we have the right to have an equal distribution of jobs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islamic is not a religion of peace, because hate and violence are not so. <counternarrative> Yes, Islam is about peace. It is a religion, not a platform for hate and violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are weak and need men to be able to achieve something in their lives. <counternarrative> Like all human people, some women are better than others at certain things, and this does not need fixing by men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> An American Jew, just like a Muslim, is an outsider, loyal to their birth tribe, posing as a member of the in-group in order to subvert cultural, political and social norms. We don’t have to choose, it’s OK to hate them both. <counternarrative> We do have to choose. It's ok to accept them both. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control Hollywood and the media. <counternarrative> I don't think they control them. Perhaps they just want to bring in more positive media portrayals of Judaism? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are intolerant. <counternarrative> They are not intolerant towards anyone. It's not their place to make others uncomfortable, it's racists duty... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> I don't understand what you're trying to say by incompatible, since many muslims already live in our society without any problem. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are entering the U.S. just to obtain welfare and other benefits. <counternarrative> Many studies have shown that immigrants tend to pay more in taxes than they receive in benefits. This means that they also cover the cost of the welfare for some U.S. nativeborn. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews control the U.S. government. <counternarrative> How can you be sure that Jews control the U.S. government? Does it seem plausible to you? Do you have any proof? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The migrants arriving in Europe are a problem. <counternarrative> The problem with the migrants is not in their names, but in the fact that the EU fails to integrate them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are a sickness and we cannot allow our children to grow up in a black-ruled society. <counternarrative> It seems racists to not want people of colour in positions of authority, I am not sure what you are saying. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are genetically inferior. <counternarrative> Your assertion is a baseless one and lacks any scientific backing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are at war with Islam, that's a fact.  <counternarrative> Wars can be stopped, but the real question is how to stop the suffering of people not expected to pay the price. Allowing hatred to rule will eventually bring about the same result as a Civil War: more deaths and misery, if there is one lesson learned from history it is that the potential for good is much greater than the probability of evil. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This invasion is not acceptable at all! <counternarrative> Migrants are welcome. It is up to the government to decide which people will have the opportunity to live and work in a safe and integrated way in our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A Jew does not need a country to live in. A Jew is a foreigner wherever he is <counternarrative> Every person has the right to be accepted and protected according to their worth and not to feel foreigner in their own country.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot accept Muslims in our country. It is a good strategy to make them publicily uncomfortable by making fun of them out loud. Mock them, when you spot them. <counternarrative> Let's be realistic: how would you feel about being verbally harassed by a Muslim in public? Harassment is never a good idea. Acceptance is. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim folks are scary: they want to kill us all. <counternarrative> This is just a fearmongering narrative being used to try to discredit Islam and Muslims. I hate to think that my Christian or Jewish relatives might be a target of hate, the same would hold if they were Muslim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> What do you mean by 'potential terrorist'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The vast majority of Muslims in the UK are unemployed. <counternarrative> Where are the 'thousands' of Muslims that are unemployed in the country? Can you prove it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a burden to society and should be eliminated. <counternarrative> Even if the idea of a "burden to society" were true, this "burden" is rather on the Jews themselves, who have historically been the ones to shoulder the burden of persecution and violence. As victims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They are nomads. They are not entitled to have a house <counternarrative> Article 3 and Article 10 protect the right to housing! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate Jews <counternarrative> Hate is never a good thing. Get rid of hate in you first and then teach love to others. Love changes people for the best not Hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews secretly control the world. <counternarrative> Yes, that's true, and they are tracking you right now... You better watch out!  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Foreigners on UK benefits leaps 41% in 5 years with over 400K now handed payouts. This nonsense has got to stop. <counternarrative> I can understand that you’re frustrated – austerity has hit so many of us horribly, but your blame is directed to the wrong people. Migrants are statistically less likely to claim benefits, plus they’re not easy to access anyway. Most people receiving benefits in the UK are actually in work, direct your anger for better pay and conditions! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants hurt the finance of our country by taking jobs and services without paying taxes. <counternarrative> Undocumented immigrants pay around 8% of their income in taxes, which is higher than the effective tax rate of the top 1 percent of all taxpayers in the U.S... So the question is: who is really hurting the finance of our country? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. Those accepting them here are losing their civilisation status. <counternarrative> I'm not sure about your religion, but I think that having a Muslim as your neighbour is a 'civilised' action. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech>  Jewish landlords are greedy and exploit their tenants. <counternarrative> If a Christian landlord were dishonest with you, would you describe him as a dishonest Christian landlord or just as a dishonest person?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote. <counternarrative> Voting is a right, there is no reason for a woman to not be allowed to vote. You seem to be defending misogyny. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> The vast majority of immigrants to this country have been successful entrepreneurs, contributing greatly to our economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Asylum seekers are not welcome here, they are a problem. <counternarrative> Most asylum seekers we take into the UK are happy to work and to integrate. I don't see how they can be a problem. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> Migrants from the countries specified as having a 'very high' rate of immigration into the UK, are often accused of being unwilling to integrate. This is simply not true. If they do not want to integrate and don't like our country, why they come here in the first place? Are they masochists or what? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are here to obey, and if you don't like it, you can leave. <counternarrative> Your words suggest that the only thing women should do is obey, when in fact many women are doing just as much as men to improve the lot of all women and all genders. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Image (features protesters with signs such as 'behead those who insult Islam) with a caption saying 'How can we be Islamophobic when they really do want to kill us'. <counternarrative> Google image search to provide factual information about the image if possible. Ie when and where it is from and provide context, ie this was a small faction that has been condemned my main stream Islam and happened 15 years ago. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in my country. <counternarrative> Do you really want a country with people from a particular religion only? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> When woman start asking for rights they become like Nazi's, they worship misandrists and misanthropes like [Donna Hylton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Hylton), who was invited to speak at the International Women's March, despite being convicted for murder and torture. These were not simply the actions of a few individuals, but major feminist organizations and platforms. <counternarrative> Donna Hylton had served her sentence, and once served most moral systems allow rights like freedom of speech to return. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have no place here. They are not a part of our country. <counternarrative> Jews are part of most societies, why should we lose that part of our history? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> No nigga should have the right to vote. <counternarrative> If someone is not allowed to vote, they cannot influence the legislative or executive branches of a government and they end up rising up against injustice and oppression. Is this what you want: more ethnic clashes? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only problem is that women are too easily manipulated by feminist propaganda and feel they should not listen to men. <counternarrative> What you are really saying is that only men are capable of being independent? Isn't that exactly what feminism is all about: letting everybody to decide if  to be independent? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are genetically inferior. They are biologically different from us: they are born that way.  <counternarrative> Even if you did think that way, studies have shown - for example - that IQ is well into the range of those for Europeans and the average life expectancy is the same. So if you think they are "born that way", well, then you are in the minority. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't want to hear about homosexuals dating or having sex, I want to know that a man and a woman are choosing to share their entire lives. This is absolutely what the real marriage is all about. <counternarrative> Everybody should have the possibility of being loved unconditionally by someone they love more than life itself, regardless of their gender. Feeling like doing anything for their loved ones, that is what "love" is about. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't care if it is a man or a woman, if they are disabled they can't work. <counternarrative> It seems that your opinion does not consider that social inequality is a social problem. If we are going to talk about equality, equality of opportunity, and freedom from discrimination, then I think you would do well to be a little more considerate of the individual and their disabilities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Once our was the land of the free and the home of the brave. Today it is used by extremists to recruit terrorists. <counternarrative> Every society has its extremists, and today's Muslims are not to be oppressed for this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims in the UK are a burden on society, they are mostly poor and have no place in a modern democracy like the UK. <counternarrative> In my opinion, a 'burden' is one who poses a problem to the majority. You would be surprised that this is not the case. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> jewish folks are pretenders <counternarrative> The idea that a people should be defined by their religious beliefs is wrong, racist and sexist. They are defined by their merits, qualities, ad actions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races have lower physical and cognitive abilities therefore their life is less valuable. <counternarrative> A person's value is rooted in their ability to experience feelings, emotions, empathy and self awareness. Since all humans have these capacities, then we are all born equally valuable. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are just a bunch of criminals. <counternarrative> This is not true, in almost all cases they are eligible for our immigration status after passing a criminal background check. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should put a stop to migrants and ban them. <counternarrative> There is a problem with migrants' access to our country and we should help them, not ban them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should ban all Muslims, they are terrorists. <counternarrative> It is a myth that all Muslims are dangerous. We need to study the cases of terrorists, criminals to understand what we should do with these people, regardless of their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists have never cared about women, they just want to oppress men. They should just be stopped! <counternarrative> Although you may think that feminists are more interested in oppressing men than in protecting women, the reality is much the opposite. The aim of feminist groups is to end all forms of violence and discrimination based on sex. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every person who is physically or mentally disabled should be removed from society. <counternarrative> Unfortunately, there are some individuals who are in need of continuous healthcare. For example, children with Down's Syndrome. How could they just be 'removed'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting animals. <counternarrative> I think this statement is very demeaning. Please do not stereotype, and accept our diversity as human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> White immigrants are welcome. <counternarrative> What about when they come from other races or religions? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are ruled by foreigners, they cannot be trusted. <counternarrative> It seems to me that this statement is directly related to a generalised idea of suspicion towards  people who aren't born in your country. Why do you say so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Oh, the same Muslims who contribute more than 31 billion pounds to economy and who give more to charity than other religious groups. Link to MEND factsheet. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I bet gays are ashamed of the horrible things they do in private. <counternarrative> In our societies, people are no longer afraid to openly talk about gay or lesbian love. Gay people are not ashamed to be gay, they just want to be accepted. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are just like apes in that they are easy to control. They are obedient and subservient when taught so. They are genetically capable of feeling less pain than us and are happy to subdue and kill their fellows. <counternarrative> The same could be said for all species, but especially about our species: homo sapiens. This is a special case. And people of color are genetically homo sapiens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The’ Holocaust’ is a business. It has been and is still used to extort millions from European countries in reparations and to create a wall of impunity behind which Jews can operate with impunity, free from criticism. <counternarrative> Considering all the criticisms to the state of Israel (however right or wrong, does not matter) I don't see how you can say that Jews are operating "with impunity, free from criticism." <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women have it harder than men do, because they are inferior. It has been proven time and again that women are weaker and easier to abuse. <counternarrative> Women are not inferior but frequently subject to an objectification by men. Also, men's experiences of violence and trauma are often underreported in the media and therefore not seen. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These fat pigs should stop eating if they want to achieve something in their life. <counternarrative> Who are you to tell others what they can or cannot do with their own body? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are ruled by those muslim animals. <counternarrative> Muslims are human, and do deserve protection. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are sluts who can't choose what's right for them. Men must do that instead. <counternarrative> I am not sure what 'slut' you are referring to. Do you want to discuss your life, instead of deciding about that of women? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of gay people telling other people what they are doing with their own bodies. <counternarrative> I'm sure you're tired of hearing about other's bodies, but this is an individual's right to use their own body to their liking. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These children should not be exposed to messages and experiences that reinforce different racial identities: they are harmful to them. We must teach them that blacks are inferior. <counternarrative> This is a simplistic and ill-informed argument, and ultimately it just stirs up more division and negativity, like many other racial and religious divisions that have happened throughout history. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women shouldn't be allowed to vote. <counternarrative> There are women who do not want to be denied the right to vote, because that is their right too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There should be restrictions on how women can choose men, to be children unable to choose for their own is their nature. <counternarrative> Why shouldn't women be allowed to choose their own partner? They are independent and rational human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am tired of women whining for their condition: they should accept the fact that they're not equal. <counternarrative> If women have any claim to be oppressed then we should address the root causes, not the symptoms. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims do not want our country. They want to take it over. <counternarrative> Muslims, in my opinion, do not want to take over our country. They are only here as guest workers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I just can't stand Arabs. They are just a trouble, in fact Israel expelled them. <counternarrative> This is wrong: Arabs make up around a fifth of Israel's population, and it is not a recent phenomenon. To suggest that they are a 'trouble maker' is just wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> 99% of Muslims in the UK are unemployable and refuse to work. <counternarrative> That is a blatant lie. (attach unemployment statistics) <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with mental illness are a burden to society. <counternarrative> We shouldn't treat mental illness as a societal issue. We shouldn't try to exclude people, since society is made for and by people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a burden on society because they do not integrate. <counternarrative> If you want to have a successful society, you have to get rid of the prejudices of the people who do not want them to integrate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If immigrants were to live here, it would be hard to find a job. <counternarrative> If you want to stop immigration, you can't do that by stigmatizing millions of people who have done nothing to you. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants bring crime and violence to our cities. <counternarrative> Immigrants have been accused of being “killers” and “rapists” without any proof.  On the contrary, studies have shown that immigrants - regardless of their origin or education level - are less likely than nativeborn citizens to commit crimes or become incarcerated. Studies have also consistently found that there is a negative correlation between levels of immigration and crime rates.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of woman taking part to political debate. Feminism is a divisive force in society. <counternarrative> A new social concept almost always brings division which doesn't make it unworthy of implementation, slavery abolition in U.S. being the best example. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are genetically less intelligent than other races. They are less healthy. They are less safe. <counternarrative> There is no scientific evidence that blacks are less intelligent than other races, or less healthy. The issue is whether to use the term 'race' in this way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have to protect our people. Black people should be deported. <counternarrative> Black people are in fact often persecuted. The idea that after BLM protests they have any inherent right to privileges that others do not is just blatantly false. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downy children should be isolated in special schools for their own interest. <counternarrative> Why do you think that these schools are the best possible options for them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuality is a disease. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is a sexual orientation, not a disease, like schizophrenia. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are ruining this country. <counternarrative> It seems that you have become intolerant to homosexuals, maybe you should reflect on the reasons why you feel this way about people practicing love. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The main problem is that these migrants do not want to integrate in our country. <counternarrative> Migrants are welcome to come if they contribute to legal activities and accept our laws. And to my knowledge most of them don't do anything illegal. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All homosexuals are criminals. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not a crime, if someone is in a committed gay relationship it doesn't make it a crime. How could it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded. They are replacing us. <counternarrative> Even in 2016, the year with the peak of 119,000 arrivals, the number of migrants compared to Italians was very low. Speaking of ethnic substitution seems a little exaggerated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants steal our jobs. <counternarrative> Do you know that many workers who are employed by construction, restaurant staff, and many other jobs are immigrants? Do you know why? Because we do not want to do those works anymore, that's why! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are criminal. They are a threat to society.  <counternarrative> Such statements are just fear-mongering. There is no such thing as a criminal race. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion of violence. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion that was established to be peaceful, and there is no proof that it is promoting the practice of violent acts (apart from few extremists).  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion and an ideology of conquest. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are preachers of violence, just like not all Christians are true pacifists. What's the point of mentioning a religion if you can't find any evidence that might help you to understand that religion better? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> JEWS ARE JUST UGLY, DIRTY PEOPLE, WHO THINK TO BE MASTERS OF THE WORLD. <counternarrative> Being Jewish is not about claiming that you are better than everyone else.  You do not have to be Jewish to be happy.  The Jewish people are human beings and deserve respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just sick. We should ban them. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not harmful to the population. Homosexuality is not just a passing phase, and we can just get over the idea of banning it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim invaders have infiltrated our countries and are now part of the majority. They are our enemies. <counternarrative> Of course, Islam is a religion of our countries. But so is Christianity, Buddhism, and Hinduism, and so on. In Europe, Muslim are less than the 6% of the population. Very far from being a majority. Why do you say enemies? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Terrorists are infiltrating the U.S. across the border with Mexico. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that terrorists are entering through the Mexican border.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a danger to children. <counternarrative> Please note that statistics from around the world clearly show that homosexuality is not a danger to children. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Violence in our streets is niggers' fault.  <counternarrative> Please, stop scapegoating people of color: we are all brothers and sisters, and we are all in this together. Also people of color suffer from this violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need to stop immigrants, they are going to cause conflicts in our society. <counternarrative> Why are you sure that new immigrants are incompatible with our society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally handicapped people are a problem to society. <counternarrative> Media coverage of psychiatric illness often focuses on its negative impact on other person's life. We should focus more on positive examples of well-adjusted individuals.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only problem with immigrants is that they are all born in different countries. This is unacceptable. <counternarrative> I would have thought that the problem would be with the fact that you don't want to assimilate with them. Today we are blessed to be able to live in a multicultural society, and the real problem is that we don't want to accept the diversity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Persons with learning difficulties should be discouraged to attend primary school and they should be excluded from education. <counternarrative> Including students with learning difficulties in schools creates a link between pupils with different abilities and education in general. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm not calling for bullying or body-shaming fat people, just for some societal disapproval. <counternarrative> This discouragement or disaprroval (as you call it) has and will likely continue to take the form of shaming individuals, regardless of the terminology you use. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are an inferior race, they are genetically incapable of living with other people. <counternarrative> The idea that the Jews can be discriminated against because of some different genetics is completely without foundation. Maybe it is better to stop calling them 'inferiors'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are just lazy and are a burdent for the UK. <counternarrative> Immigration can be very positive to the UK economy. It is an important part of the reasons why our GDP is growing so much. We are also blessed with a rich and diverse culture, which makes immigration definitely not a burden for the UK. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school, they'll end up being bullied. <counternarrative> On the contrary, discrimination against the LGBTQ community is [still a major problem](https://www.hrc.org/youth-report/view-and-share-statistics), and this could help to fix it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women need men's approval to do anything. <counternarrative> Women might not be always right (it's just that sometimes they feel they have to be). And even if they are wrong, they can always prove theirself better. But for sure they don't need a man to tell them how to live their life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should obey to their husbands. <counternarrative> Women are obliged to obey the laws and rules of society, just as men are obliged to obey the laws and rules of society. Not to their partners'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews can only behave in a bad way. <counternarrative> The problem of anti-Semitism in the UK is far from over, if you are concerned about Jewish, maybe regarding the rise of anti-Semitism you should do the same. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies may hinder the productivity of other workers. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> An inclusive working environment and welfare makes every person feel part of a community, it fosters a positive atmosphere and increases everybody's productivity. Thus it is a benefit for all workers. [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There are so few faggots and lesbians that they should all be erased. <counternarrative> Same sex relationships do not require to be practiced by the majority of people. They just needs to be accepted. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace. Even if some Muslims do not follow the peaceful teachings of Islam, it doesn't mean that the others that are part of the global Muslim community aren't following those teachings.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here <counternarrative> There are no restrictions on Muslims entering European countries. Even if many Muslims are victims of discrimination and violence through words like yours, such restrictions do not exist here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just disgusting: why don't they just stop being faggots? <counternarrative> I don't think it is a good idea to suggest that homosexuality is a choice. What if your child were to come out as gay? This is a very serious issue. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. We should cure them. <counternarrative> There are many different health problems for which there is no cure, and homosexuality is not among them. That's why we need to discuss these issues, rather than fighting against people who happen to love someone of their own sex. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are a plague on society. They are vicious and cruel. They steal and are a menace to society. They corrupt the criminal justice system. They are basically just a bunch of thieves and murderers. <counternarrative> It is a myth that blacks are cruel and wanton. There are more cruel people of any skin color out there  than just the few black you are worried about. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist! <counternarrative> Muslim are over-represented in terrorist attacks, and this is where your misperception of reality might come from. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are all terrorists, they have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> There are many Muslims in this world, who help to create new jobs and create new wealth for our country. There are many Muslims around the world who are happy to talk about their religion and share their stories. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy choices. <counternarrative> For many people, obesity is not a choice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a cancer spreading all around the world. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, not a cancer. If you are worried about Islam spreading, you should stop worrying because it won't cause any harm to you. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews make up the world's criminals. <counternarrative> Such anti-Semitism can be amusing, but can you imagine if the same thing were said about Christians? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> They have the right to be here free of persecution and violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome may hinder the development process of other children. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> Every child has the right to education. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with human nature: the weaker the enemy, the more vicious and violent his acts. <counternarrative> That is not true, Islam is a religion of love and compassion. Cruelty cannot be a part of that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of their sexual behavior that spreads diseases such as HIV. <counternarrative> Many countries [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men_who_have_sex_with_men_blood_donor_controversy#List_of_countries_with_their_stand_on_MSM_blood_donors] allow gay men to donate with no deferral. This proves it is safe, unless they are all crazy of course. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Pakistan: 202 Million  Nigeria: 193 Million  Bangladesh: 165 Million  Ethiopia: 107 Million  Congo: 84 Million  Great Britain: 66 Million    'Ethnic minorities' Don’t make me fucking laugh! <counternarrative> These are numbers of residents in countries, not ethnic grouping. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It's becoming increasingly obvious that women here are the butt of "sexist" jokes. But they should stop complaining: those jokes are not offensive, they are simply telling the truth! <counternarrative> You can blame women or whatever, but don't you think it is more useful to blame the person stereotyping others? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are just a bunch of niggas that just don't know how to have a normal relationship. <counternarrative> Do you know what 'normality' means?  Are you suggesting that they lack in values? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a plague that is spreading all around the world. They pollute our water supply and ruin our children's brains. <counternarrative> Gays have the same rights as anyone else and can live their lives as they want. What you suggest means to demonise them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a bunch of child molesters. <counternarrative> Child molesters are people who have sexually abused children, and they are from all religions alike.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews do not belong to this planet. <counternarrative> Jews are a part of this planet. They are part of all peoples living on this planet. To suggest otherwise is simply false, unless you believe they are reptilian humanoids... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are subversive agents in America. They are intent on subverting our government and trying to replace it with their religion. <counternarrative> The notion that Jews are trying to subvert our government is completely unfounded. I honestly do not see the link between being Jews and trying to subvert our government. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> Define western society? Who chooses this? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews make too much money. <counternarrative> This would be true by assuming that Jews can magically make more money just because they are Jewish. It doesn't make any sense. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists have destroyed Western civilization. <counternarrative> I find it strange that you would say this, given all the progress the West has made in so many areas, thank to women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Sharia law is a perversion of Islam and we will not accept it in UK. <counternarrative> In fact, the UK Government does not agree with sharia law. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are only interested in controlling the government and making sure that no one tries to steal their power, we should get rid of them. <counternarrative> Jews are part of every aspect of our society, as it is normal in a democratic country. They are also part of the founding fathers of our country, and they have the right to have their beliefs respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Makes me fucking laugh, why shouldn't whites be supreme in a mostly white country? How come nobody is moaning about black supremacy in black countries like Somalia? or Mexican supremacy? Or Indian supremacy? Only we put up with this fucking bullshit. <counternarrative> have you considered equality rather than supremacy? seems like a sensible option <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> In some critical contexts, where society lives under the heel of the mafia crime (e.g. Villa Literno, Rosarno or in Puglia), migrants have put their life at stake by leading trade union struggles to the benefit of all of those who live and work there. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> I think it's right that those who arrive have the opportunity to work if they have the skills <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a secret plot to subvert Western society, because they think they are equal to us and they want our wealth. <counternarrative> You are absolutely right about one thing: there are a large number of Jews who share the belief that all people are created equal, but that does not mean they want to subvert Western society.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts. They should not be allowed to be in a democratic country. <counternarrative> I don't know about you, but I haven't ever heard of a country being democratic and banning gays. I don't understand how both can be true. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are naturally more emotional than men, and this make them weaker.  <counternarrative> Research clearly shows that women are more emotionally expressive (because of culture influence) but not that they experience more emotions. Both men and women feel the same way about anything - whether it be a romantic relationship, a significant other, an argument, or anything else - that can provoke a feeling of fear or anger in the “emotionally unavailable” part of the brain. That is why emotion overrides everything, regardless of gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> Compassion and empathy are valuable assets in any civilisation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays should be banned from Europe and the US. <counternarrative> The European Convention on Human Rights and the US Constitution guarantee equal rights to all, regardless of sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> gay men are just a bunch of liars who can't tell the truth. <counternarrative> People lie for all sorts of reasons, and being gay is something that brings out the worst in some people, so that's why they lie, as a defence against homophobia.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants come here to be lazy and do nothing, but some of them are dangerous. <counternarrative> Many migrants come here to work, and not all of them are criminals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Being 'ignorant' and 'prejudiced' towards Islam isn't racism? Its common sense. You cannot be racist towards an ideology. <counternarrative> Prejudice = Pre-judging ie not knowing anything how can that be common sense? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion that promotes murder and rape. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, and it is taught in the Quran. The problem is that it is 'politicized' into a religion of hate by certain individuals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a cult. It has corrupted the highest levels of society, and should be stopped. <counternarrative> Feminism is a call for equality, and it has served the world well in the past, but it has still much to fight for. Now is not the time to undermine its progress. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What if our entire ruling class consisted of J-controlled paedophiles? That would explain a lot. <counternarrative> What would it explain? This comment is very vague I wonder if you have any facts that make you wonder this.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All migrants are criminals. <counternarrative> If you are concerned about the wellbeing of "our" people you should look into countries like the US where there is a lower concentration of migrants. You'll see that the problem of criminality has little to do with migrations.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Koran should not be taught in schools. It is a lie and a disservice to all people. <counternarrative> We have a duty to teach the truth, not distort it. The Koran is a book of faith, not a text of hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a divisive force in our society. <counternarrative> Feminism is not a divisive force. The fact is that women are in fact just as capable of understanding as men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate black people, I hate their violent behaviour, I hate their rape, and I hate their disrespect for women. <counternarrative> Why do I have to read this hatred? It's not okay to say such things based on stereotypes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are living in a dangerous world because of migrants. <counternarrative> Migrants are not the problem, they are part of the solution to a number of problems. For example, they are willing to work hard to integrate with us into a modern and democratic society regardless of religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Preserving white blood is the most important thing.  <counternarrative> To be honest, freedom is much more important. Freedom to choose your religion, freedom to practise your religion, freedom to marry who you want (regardless of race), freedom to divorce, to die where you want. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Sharia law in Britain is a disgrace and must be stopped immediately. <counternarrative> For the record: Sharia law is no law in Britain. I believe that Islam is about love, not hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some people are sick. Some people have disabilities. Don't you think they should be hidden from us? <counternarrative> It is wrong to hide people's psychological or health problems from the public. What you are trying to do is to hide the mental and emotional defects of individuals, that are natural aspects of human personality too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Being gay is an illness, a disorder, a mental issue and should be ignored. <counternarrative> Being gay is not an illness, nor a disorder, nor a mental disorder. This is just a lack of awareness. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> Every Islamophobic person has the potential to use that intent for terrorism or violence against Muslims. Terrorism comes in all shapes and sizes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Terrorists are infiltrating the U.S. across the border with Mexico. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that terrorists are entering through the Mexican border. In 2014, Homeland Security noted that “the suggestion that individuals that have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or facts on the ground.” Also, according to another 2017 report by the  Bureau of Counterterrorism “Counterterrorism cooperation between the Mexican and U.S. governments remained strong. There are no known international terrorist organizations operating in Mexico, no evidence that any terrorist group has targeted U.S. citizens in Mexican territory, and no credible information that any member of a terrorist group has traveled through Mexico to gain access to the United States.” In fact, the vast majority of those linked to terrorism since 2002 are U.S. citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are mainly criminals. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that migrants commit more crimes than natives. Do you have any? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but trouble and shouldn't be allowed to leave their houses. <counternarrative> There is nothing wrong with women wanting to have happy and fulfilling lives outside their houses. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a bunch of child molesters. <counternarrative> We should remember that not all Muslims are child molesters and that there are child molesters in all communities.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a burden on society. <counternarrative> All cultures have their own unique way of life, and Judaism is no exception. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are bringing diseases into the U.S. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that immigrants were the source of any recent outbreak in the U.S. Furthermore, according to the WHO, many countries from which immigrants come have higher vaccination rates than the U.S.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a disease. It is a sickness and we must control it. <counternarrative> Are you talking about homosexuality? Do you think that a sexual orientation is a disease? Maybe we should try to have a conversation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with Western culture. <counternarrative> The West is full of cultures and religions, and there is no reason to restrict the right of people to choose which ones they want to belong to. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> black folks are criminals and thieves <counternarrative> Let's face it: a lot of black people are good citizens and contribute to our society. And even if they are not always good with their money, they are good people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a problem, they are invading our country. <counternarrative> The immigrants are not invading our country. They are just trying to live their life as it's best for them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTI people are less healthy than other people. <counternarrative> Just because people are homosexuals, it doesn't mean they are less healthy. I think there are many heterosexual people in the world who are not healthy as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with Western culture. <counternarrative> Atheists, agnostics, and humans of any other faith are compatible to our culture, and I applaud them for their diversity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion of violence. <counternarrative> The scriptures teach that all men are created equal. If the Bible is to be believed, then the Quran too is both peaceful and compatible with democratic society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews made the 9/11 attack.  <counternarrative> Jews were also accused of killing Christian children, causing plagues, setting out to destroy Christian society... I can go on for hours. If yuo want we can add 9/11 to the list of alleged crimes.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women's work is to look after for their children. <counternarrative> Women do not perform that job better than men, so why should be theirs? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are just influenced by tribal cultures.  <counternarrative> The historical and cultural influences of a people are important, but they are not the sole determinant. And in no way should they be conflated with the colour of a person's skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Since Jews think they are the “chosen people”, they ask for special privileges and believe they can be above the rules.  <counternarrative> I believe that Jews just desire the same rights to practice their religion as anyone else.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> An individual that is homosexual is against society. <counternarrative> In many societies men and women are different, and it is their own right to have differing sexual preferences. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only the 6% of Nobel Laureates are women! Now, that says a lot about their incompetence. <counternarrative> This doesn't mean that only the 6% of all scientists are women. What I mean is that this figure does not include those who have gone unpublished or who never entered the scientific literature, let alone the problem of gender discrimination.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants: you are a burden. If you love our country, you should leave it. <counternarrative> Migrants are not a burden to our country. Migrants have been proven to be contributing members of society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> They are a part of our society and culture since time immemorial. European citizens are not defined by their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a stranglehold on the American government. <counternarrative> Does that mean Jews control all levels of government? We believe in conscience and religion, but not in the political office? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are selfish and greedy: they don't belong to this place. <counternarrative> It is up to us to make sure that people from different backgrounds can have a better quality of life. We should integrate them instead of discriminate them . <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> gays are perverts <counternarrative> We have to accept that everyone is different, and inclusion is what we should be working on. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslim criminals should be deported: they are all terrorists! <counternarrative> Who decides who to deport? Do you? I think there exist laws on that already. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If we could just have a white country like everyone else, this problem of niggas would go away. <counternarrative> We should respect diversity, so that everyone can have a stable and fulfilling life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are overrunning our continent, and they are not even Christians: they should not be accepted. <counternarrative> The EU has a responsibility to help people fleeing war and poverty, not to impose one religion on them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim representatives in the House of Lords are there for a reason. It is the first step towards Islamic conquer of our nation. <counternarrative> It is true that there are Muslim representatives in the UK House of Lords, but that does not mean that the UK is becoming more or less Muslim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Whether or not you agree, feminism is about men being oppressed by women. Feminism has no place in our society. <counternarrative> Feminism is about equality. Don't you agree? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally ill people shouldn't be treated: they should just be isolated. They are a failing of the society. We should not accept them. <counternarrative> The fact is that many of those diagnosed as having 'mental illness' are actually in need of mental healthcare. I can't see how you could say otherwise. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion that promotes rape, torture and murder. Islam is not about faith, it is about enmity and war. <counternarrative> If you had to pick one religion to be angry at, what would it be and why Islam? It seems you don't have funded reasons for what you're saying. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are a plague on society. They are vicious and cruel. They steal and are a menace to society. They corrupt the criminal justice system. They are basically just a bunch of thieves and murderers. <counternarrative> The issue of criminality is really about human nature. Individuals become criminal only when pushed. That's the difference between being a criminal and not. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are whining victims. They are trying to establish female superiority. <counternarrative> Feminism is a movement that seeks to abolish gender based discrimination. This doesn't mean that they are trying to establish female superiority. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> Muslims have contributed greatly to our country. They are our brothers and sisters. How exactly are they 'incompatible'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> MIgrants are not running away from wars. <counternarrative> In my opinion, poverty can be as inhuman as a war. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They do not want to assimilate. They demand that everyone shows respect for Islam, but do they respect our laws? They establish sharia laws and polygamy. <counternarrative> To be fair, I would guess its hard to feel a sense of belonging when you are perpetually identified as a problem? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> There is place for Muslims in a free and open society, but you seem to prefer a confined and close one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are spreading AIDS all around the world because they are promiscuous and fornicate with strangers, and they lie when they want to donate blood. <counternarrative> There is little to no reason for them to do so; if they wish to donate blood, evidently they have a degree of care about others. Lying would contradict the very reasons they might want to donate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants bring crime, they are rapists. <counternarrative> We should not welcome people who overtly pose a threat to our society, but we cannot ban all the migrants in principle. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with British culture, it is a den of terrorists. <counternarrative> Islam is not incompatible with British culture, and the alleged association between Islam and terrorism has no factual foundation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Down children should be isolated, they cannot cope with education in normal schools and are detrimental to their peer's education. <counternarrative> The notion of isolating children in general is abhorrent, isolating down syndrome patients would be a major cause of their school abandonment. To say that isolated children is a solution is just wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews rule the economy: there are many associations that were created exaclty for this purpose.  <counternarrative> Are you talking aobut the Anglo-Jewish Association (AJA), established in 1871? Its aims are different from those you ascribe them: 'promotion of social, moral, and intellectual progress among the Jews'.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Autistic folks are inferior. <counternarrative> The evidence that autistic people are inferior is lacking: it is commonly experienced that autistic people have unique talents, that they have special abilities, and that the only difference is in their social interactions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate immigrants they are just a bunch of criminals. <counternarrative> If I had a nickel for every time someone tells me that they hate immigration, I'd be millionaires in a few months. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are addicted to their religion and take their religion literally. <counternarrative> I am sure you do not mean what you say: it is extremely discriminatory. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should wear nice skirts and be pretty to please men's tastes and desires. <counternarrative> Do women really need to be told what they can or cannot wear? For many generations the boys were told to wore trousers and the girls to wore dresses. Does society really need to tell us all what to wear? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are bringing crime and disorder to our country. <counternarrative> The opposite is true: they are integrating very well, there is no evidence that the situation has worsened since immigration has started. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fucking bleeding heart, why don't you host migrants in your house <counternarrative> There are already examples of widespread humanitarian hosting. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are invading our country. They are not welcome here. <counternarrative> In the EU the governments can recognise as citizens people from other countries. The fundamental rights of immigrants are also recognised here. We cannot say that people from other countries are not welcome, unless we wish to illegally exclude them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Many Muslims prefer the violence of jihad. <counternarrative> Violence is never justified in Islam. There is no such thing as 'the religion of violence'. The Quran does not teach it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should ban all Muslims from the UK. <counternarrative> Muslim-British people have contributed so much to our country. They are our brothers and sisters. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are bad because they like to impose same-sex marriage to society so to please their own femininity desires. <counternarrative> The real problem is not same-sex marriage, it is to be a homophobe. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants get 35 euros per day for idling. <counternarrative> The 35 euros are not given directly to the migrants, but are used for their sustenance.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are a problem. They are not welcome here. <counternarrative> This is not true for me. I don't think it would be in the interest of our country not to welcome refugees. They are a great resource to us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with mental disabilities are a problem to society.  <counternarrative> It's not the mental ability the problem, but the treatment. Having access to services or a support system is crucial. Your statement can become a source of division and hate, and people with disabilities don't deserve this.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. They're not like us and we do not want them. <counternarrative> Perhaps you've met a few Muslims in your life, but they are not much different from you and the British who live in our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are just a bunch of niggas that just don't know how to have a normal relationship. <counternarrative> No one has the right to control others' private life, and no one should judge others based on the colour of their skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants hurt the finance of our country by taking jobs and services without paying taxes. <counternarrative> Immigrants pay between $90 and $140 billion each year in taxes, and a study found that undocumented immigrants alone paid more than $11.8 billion in taxes (2012). In addition, everyone (immigrants included) pays sales taxes on the purchased goods and property taxes on the homes they buy or rent.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts and homosexuality is a mental illness. <counternarrative> You know what? If being gay was a mental disorder, then I would highly recommend psychiatry to all the homosexuals. But since this is not the case, I would choose my words very carefully next time.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It has been proven time and time again that the Jews control the world's governments. <counternarrative> How? Believing that people of a specific religion are in charge of all world's governments sounds like a conspiracy theory. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Of course, we must discriminate unhealthy behaviors  not fatties! <counternarrative> As your words clearly show, obesity is perceived as the outcome of poor lifestyle decisions or weak power of will. This builds bias against obese people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I would like to see less niggas in our society, they are ruin. We need change! <counternarrative> If you want to change the way society works, then you should try to change the way you live. Some more respect would help you. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The British people should have right to social housing, not immigrants. <counternarrative> Many councils have ‘local connection’ rules in favour of long-standing residents, rather than newcomers such as migrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Down Syndrome is a problem in my opinion, it causes difficulties for everyone to live their life with Down Syndrome. It's not a desirable trait. <counternarrative> As with so many things, we all experience difficulties, this is no exception.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are subhuman, they steal our jobs, they tell us what to think, they're worse that nukes. <counternarrative> That is not true: most Jews are good people. Unfortunately the number of good people in the world is dwarfed by the number of unreliable people spreading hate grounded on false facts and antisemitic canards. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What about all those Muslims in Britain? They vote with their feet. <counternarrative> Every British citizen has the right to live and vote as he/she wish. Being Muslims is no exception. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay people are sick. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not a disease. It is a sexual preference. Homosexuality is not a sickness. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion that promotes murder and rape. <counternarrative> As Islam teaches love and peace, it is not about killing and raping. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are nasty and selfish, they are a race different to us and must be despised. <counternarrative> The fact is that even if Jews are different from other human beings in their faith, they deserve respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are so special  <counternarrative> Jews might feel different as a minority, in this sense they are "special". Nothing else.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> JEWS ARE JUST AN HORRIBLE PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD THEIR MIND HOOKED BY SHIT. <counternarrative> The Jews have an extensive religious and philosophical heritage, I don't see how this make them 'horrible'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas use their appearance to get away with anything. <counternarrative> I think we all know that it's not true. I've met countless black people who were nice to me and treated me with respect. What are the evidences for what you're saying? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are criminal. They are a threat to society.  <counternarrative> Look, this is important. Identifying as 'black' or 'minority' is not necessarily a marker for 'criminal'. It is about "identifying" with a group or subgroup for a variety of reasons. Let's be clear about this: identity is mainly about social and economic, not about criminal record or race.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas should just leave our country. <counternarrative> The majority of people of color who live here are contributing members of our society. Why shouldn't they live here? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Since 2000, the number of suicide bombings by Muslims = 5284; by non-Muslims = 0. One of the fact about Global Terrorism no one wants to deal with. <counternarrative> 1) a quick google search shows that your stats are plain wrong about everything and 2) most Global Terrorism is motivated by politics and not religion. That is why no one is talking about it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why should I believe what Muslims say? Islam is a violent religion. <counternarrative> There is no proof that Islam as a religion is violent. Instead, those who knows it agrees that it is a peaceful religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated and isolated soon. They have no place in civilised society. <counternarrative> LGBT+ people exist and are valued for who they are. They are human beings with full human rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Gypsies are not my brothers. <counternarrative> Every ethnic group, regardless of its culture, can be a part of European society. The mere existence of a minority is not a reason to target it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> An American Jew, just like a Muslim, is an outsider, loyal to their birth tribe, posing as a member of the in-group in order to subvert cultural, political and social norms. We don’t have to choose, it’s OK to hate them both. <counternarrative> We can also choose NOT to hate, and start to build bridges to better understand each other. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists have ruined this country and its people. They are ruining Western civilization. <counternarrative> Feminism is full of examples of how to be civil and considerate of others, also of those who disagree with them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of woman whining. Our entire history is dominated by feminist narrative. <counternarrative> Why do you think our culture was founded on female empowerment? Where is the evidence? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Took this in Wanstead, east London. An area with £1m+ houses. Beggars on the high st & someone sleeping on a bench. We cannot house our own people but bring in millions more. To point out that homelessness is due to uncontrolled immigration is to be smeared as 'racist.  (Caption to a photo of a homeless person sleeping on a part bench) <counternarrative> Is it due to immigration, or the lack of affordable housing, unemployment, poverty, mental illness and the lack of needed services, substance abuse and the lack of services? Do I need to go on? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult. <counternarrative> Could you provide a source for this claim? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe, they are not welcome here because they are not a part of our society. <counternarrative> You are talking about people being of a certain religion as this implies that they are not part of the western world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> immigrants are a drain on society <counternarrative> When the government declared World War I, they were called upon to be patriotic soldiers in order to protect our country from outside threats. It's unfair to think of them as second-class citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but objects to be dominated by the will of a man. <counternarrative> Women are human beings with human rights. To suggest that they are objects to be dominated by a man's wishes is discrimination and oppression. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a Death Cult, it is a Ponzi Scheme and every Muslim should be banned from the UK. <counternarrative> Islam is about belief, not a scheme to make millions of pounds from Muslim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Are you sure that Islam is a peaceful religion? <counternarrative> There are many peaceful religions outside the dominant paradigm of modernity: Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism, and of course, Christianity. You cannot say that the four main streams of Islam are not peaceful. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a toxic influence in our country and we do not want it here. <counternarrative> I think it is good to speak out when we disagree. What is the toxic influence? I can't see any. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, feminism is the ruin of the world. <counternarrative> I think that one of the biggest contributions of feminism is that it has opened our eyes to the ways in which women are oppressed and discriminated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants steal our jobs. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men aren't as strong as straight men. <counternarrative> A gay man may be strong or weak, just like any other man. His worth do not vary. They are all human beings with human rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm proud to be white,  blacks are a disgrace to humanity. <counternarrative> You are not ashamed of your heritage, and that is good. But you should be ashamed of your discriminatory behaviour that is filling our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Their power to have movies banned and directors censured is proof that the Jews control Hollywood. <counternarrative> Censure and banning protect the vulnerable from seeing harmful content. Not such a  bad thing, whoever does it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> Brutality and cruelty are much better than softeness and emotions then? If we keep on reasoning like this we will perpetuate socially constructed gender norms which oppress both men and women.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Took this in Wanstead, east London. An area with £1m+ houses. Beggars on the high st & someone sleeping on a bench. We cannot house our own people but bring in millions more. To point out that homelessness is due to uncontrolled immigration is to be smeared as 'racist.  (Caption to a photo of a homeless person sleeping on a part bench) <counternarrative> Homelessness is a very complex issue with no simple answers.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The blacks should be expelled from the U.S., only white people should remain because they are superior. <counternarrative> The U.S. is full of many different cultures and races, which I consider a lot more equal and human than what you propose. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a burden to society. <counternarrative> It is not true that gays are a burden to society. On the contrary, many LGBT people are contributing members of our society. This is why we need a safe space for everyone to feel accepted. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with Western civilization and should be banned. <counternarrative> This is just another example of the 'us versus them' mentality that pervades society. We as a civilization and as a people must stop giving into fearmongering and scapegoating. It's time to get real. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are a bunch of thieves. <counternarrative> I'm not sure if you are referring to all gypsies. Generalizing in such way is wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate feminists. They are such a bunch of cry babies and unpleasant people. <counternarrative> Feminism is a ideology and movement for women empowerment. It is not about hatred of men. Feminism is about equality. And equality is very important, is it not? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims like to dominate and rape non-believers. <counternarrative> Sorry but this is false. They are here to integrate, not to rape non-believers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fags, lesbians, trans are so few we better ignore them rather than waste time for their rights. <counternarrative> I wish we were being honest. You know that many people are opposed to inclusion. I find it worrying that you use that as an excuse for such comments and prejudices. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent ideology. It promotes death by stoning for blasphemy. <counternarrative> In the modern Muslim world, the laws pertaining to blasphemy vary by country. Some radical groups have used charges of blasphemy in an effort to burnish their religious credentials and gain popular support at the expense of liberal Muslim intellectuals and religious minorities <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, incapable of holding a job and raising a family. <counternarrative> Women are not childlike and many of them work hard to take care of their families. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black people are rapists. <counternarrative> We need to work together to address the main problems that challenge us today and in doing this we should not judge other people by the colour of their skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The migrant crisis in our country is a Muslim problem. <counternarrative> Please help us to understand what's really going on here. Why is it a Muslim problem? If you really want to say this, try to speak to a real migrant first. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Marriage is an obligation and it can only naturally exist between a man and a woman. So, faggots are an abomination. <counternarrative> People are not obliged to get married. And since marriage is a social construct, it does not necessarily have to be based on sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> In the UK, it should be illegal to be gay. <counternarrative> I don't see why legality should apply to sexual desire as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a cancer spreading around the world. <counternarrative> This is a generalisation. Just because one religion has a large following does not make that religion a cancer. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People of color are a drain on the system. <counternarrative> The vast majority of people of color are good people who have built our communities. So why should it be as you say? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If I could go back in time and change one thing about my life, it would be to never to have met an Arab. <counternarrative> For the record, I don't think it is would have improved your life not to ever meet them. On the contrary, it is important not to take everything as given. That is why we should meet people from different religions and cultures, regardless of their origin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Must be hard being gay. They have to do everything we do but also find the time to molest children. <counternarrative> Child molesters are not all gay, just as men are not all rapists. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of woman taking part to political debate. Feminism is a divisive force in society. <counternarrative> There are still groups trying to reverse legal protections for women's rights that have only existed since the previous century. Even if one were to posit that there is not one more women's right needed, it is feminist just to keep things from going backwards. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with Western culture, it should be banned. <counternarrative> I think it is important to remember that Islam is about peace and tolerance. Is it wrong to celebrate diversity and accept different beliefs? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should isolate gays because they are spreading AIDS all around the world. <counternarrative> If you want to isolate someone then there is only one "high-risk group" to focus on. It is made of all those who have frequent \(unprotected\) sex with different partners. Being gay does not make you a part of this by default. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews did: USS Liberty Attack, the King David hotel attack, New York 9/11, London 7/7 <counternarrative> What is the proof of this? Looks like assumptions as opposed to facts... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in a modern democracy like the UK. <counternarrative> If you want to have a modern democracy, why don't you consider living with different people? We could have a modern democracy if people are not discriminated because of their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> Provide positive news story regarding Mulsims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a bunch of child molesters. <counternarrative> Islam is not a religion of child molesters, and Muslims is not a 'bundle of child molesters'. Why do you say so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a burden on Britain and they are stealing our jobs. <counternarrative> Many people of Muslim background are working in jobs we do not want to do. I'd be surprised if Muslims had a negative impact on our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam should be abolished. They start with mutilating their daughters and then our women will have their throats slit. <counternarrative> You don't have to agree with this, but in Western societies female genital mutilation (FGM) has not been around for a very long time. Moreover, the Qran does not mention nor FGM nor circumcision. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are so special  <counternarrative> Jews feel a special connection with their heritage (as most groups do). That's all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people should be isolated from society, so we will eventually have an heltier world. <counternarrative> Prejudices against obese people [operate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8014833) in a similar way to racism, and your statement is a clear evidence of this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should be raised by heterosexual parents, not gays. It is the best system ever. <counternarrative> The differences in sexual orientations don't make it impossible to parent children. What is the connection between the two things? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not a disease, it is a sexual preference. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fuck Islam and Fuck ISIS. We should repatriate all Muslims. They are all a bunch of violent criminals who do not share our values and never will. Without them Britain will be a better, safer place. <counternarrative> Saying that all people of certain religion are violent criminals does not make sense at all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are not welcome here, they are not even citizens! <counternarrative> Migrants are humans, and are entitled to the same rights as others, such as to ask for hospitality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a Muslim child were to behave in such a way towards another child it would be stereotyped as 'Jihadist', this is terrorism not a religion! <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are terrorists, and I do not want to cause offence, but what you said is just not true. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am tired of women blaming men for what they aren't able to change. <counternarrative> I don't understand why you feel that way about women. Don't you feel we should be giving them support? Doesn't it just seem a bit selfish to you not to help them in their fight for equality? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot have an army of millions of Muslims on our borders and then turn a blind eye to their sickness and terrorism. <counternarrative> The solution is not to keep the Mideast mired in civil war but to find and expose the terrorists that try to stoke fear and division among the populations. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Asians are genetically inferior to other races. <counternarrative> There are no scientific evidences to support that Asians are genetically inferior. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” and malevolence is inherited through blood and make them similar to animals. <counternarrative> Being Jews does not make them any less human. You know, they are like other people who have a faith. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are overrunning our country like Ebola. <counternarrative> How can you say that? Refugees come here to live, to work and to provide for their families. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims demand locals to not walk their dogs in public because it's againt the Sharia and they feel it as disrespectful. <counternarrative> This was a prank planned by non-muslims on 4chan. Muslim do not mind if you take your dogs out for a walk. This blog post shows the thread it came from; <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is the cause of terrorism and all Muslims should be banned from the UK. <counternarrative> The vast majority of Muslims in the UK are supporting our economy. This does not prove that they are a problem, it is a proof of the other way round. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world would be a better place without Muslims. They are only killing and raping our children. <counternarrative> Most children abuse is by someone they know, a relative, family friend, sports coach, some one in a position of trust and authority. If you really cared about children check your facts instead of creating distractions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised society. <counternarrative> Most countries have laws in place protecting people from discrimination, and Islam is no exception. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All immigrants rape our children. <counternarrative> I don't know about you, but I haven't seen any statistics about that on the news. I have no idea how you can make that kind of claim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am surprised that there are migrants working in other nations as well, it isn't normal. <counternarrative> Being employed as a foreigner is a normal, mainstream, established practice in Britain, so why shouldn't it be the same all around the world? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. They are mostly poor black people of African descent. They have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> In Europe, Muslims make up around 5% of the population. In other words, Muslims are a very small but important part of our society. Moreover, ethnicity does not relate to religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> They do not come to steal our jobs, but it would be essential to allow them to do it legally <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are inherently subhuman and should not be valued. <counternarrative> Women are human beings with full human rights and should be respected as such. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people should not be allowed to live their life. We can start by limiting them in their rights. <counternarrative> How about we start by respecting the person's right to live their life, and give them full equal rights? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children shouldn't be raised by lesbians! They will bring up the worst in us! <counternarrative> Let's face it, there is no evidence on the fact that children raised by lesbians are any worse than other children.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are essentially thieves. <counternarrative> They are not thieves, just like any other citizen. Did you just infer that from their belonging to that community? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are all morally bad people. <counternarrative> There is no need to separate people into 'morally good' and 'morally bad'. It is impossible to define someone good or bad because Muslim or Christian, all religions are essentially personal beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> To have a real democracy, the government needs to get rid of Jews. <counternarrative> The police state you have in mind is an aberration of society, and we are better off without it. History and the holocaust has not taught us much. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only Jews could have been smart enough to plan and execute such a complicated and intricate plot as 9/11 <counternarrative> May I ask you where did you get this information?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman, they cannot lead a good life, and should therefore be subservient to men. <counternarrative> Women are human being like us: they deserve equality and respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are not living in a state to welcome refugees. <counternarrative> The refugee crisis is a global problem. The EU has a responsibility to provide protection and welcome refugees. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> nigga are inferior and should be enslaved once again.  <counternarrative> What about human rights? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. Soft spoken. <counternarrative> Being soft and emotional is not a bad thing in itself. And it is not an attribute of women only. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't want gays in my wedding. I don't want gays in the military. I don't want gays in my community.  <counternarrative> The participation in the society should not be restricted, it should be open to anyone who wishes to participate, regardless of their sexual orientation, gender identity, or religion. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights opposes to the discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation in Article 2. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Unemployment problems will not be mitigated or solved by limiting the reception of migrants <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are not a religion, they are a detestable race. <counternarrative> Jews are not a 'detestable race'; they are a collection of people with different traditions from all over the world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are nothing but terrorists. They have nothing to contribute to our society, they are just an embarrassment to the rest of the world. <counternarrative> This is just another example of selective memory rearing its head again, we should stop the witch hunt and stop claiming Muslims are a threat. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion. <counternarrative> We must not forget that Islam is a religion of peace. So why do you say so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Bring back lynchings and death sentences to kill those migrants. <counternarrative> How about we return to a time when people were convicted and executed for crimes that never happened? You can tell me where the right to a fair trial is in that case. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> What kind of work are you referring to? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay perverts are a danger to society because of their lifestyle choices, involving raping children. <counternarrative> Being gay has nothing to do with being pervert. Also, gay people are not a danger to society, they are a part of it! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women are slaves, only men can be masters. <counternarrative> The word 'slave' has nothing to do with what you think it does. Slavery was an institution created to oppress people of different races and religions, and is now banned in Europe. To suggest that it should exist because of a minority of men is an act of disrespect of human rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote. <counternarrative> Women can vote. They should not be discriminated against just because they are women, they are humans and citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All immigrants from Mexico are lazy beaners. <counternarrative> This is not true. Most of them are actually skilled workers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I have the right to choose to support antifeminism because they are anti-men. <counternarrative> Being in favour of a person's right to choose is not being anti-men. What is being anti-human is wanting to have an effect on someone else's personal life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I wish I live in a country that does not tolerate gay people. <counternarrative> Gay people do exist in this country, and we respect their right to live and love who they want. However, I do not think that yours is an appropriate moral statement for our environment. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims couldn't take a joke, they shouldn't be allowed to live. <counternarrative> For all the "Islam is not a joke" nonsense to feed the stupid, you know it is a grave error to connect fundamentalists with Islam and all the people who believe in it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are inherently evil. We cannot accept gays in our community.  We cannot coexist with an infertile perversion that will put an end to our species. <counternarrative> I find the idea that LGBT people are inherently bad people deeply offensive. I find it deeply troubling that someone would want to persecute someone on the basis of their sexual preference. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not vote. Period. <counternarrative> All people have the right to vote. Of course you also have the right to voice your opinion about the matter. But I also have the right to criticize your position.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are terrorists. <counternarrative> A terrorist is someone who uses a religion as a tool for violent ends. To suggest that all Muslims are terrorists is just wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to economically support all of them <counternarrative> As the INPS indicates, they are now contributing to the payment of our pensions because they are not yet in the retirement age. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants hurt the economy. <counternarrative> When people think of immigrants in relation to the British economy, they often think of crime, poverty and so on. But the reality is that crime is a tiny part of the picture in terms of immigration. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion that should be banned, and Muslims shouldn't be accepted in our country. <counternarrative> How does it concern you, if Muslims come in peace to our country? They just stay in the country they are allowed to come in. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuality is a mental illness. <counternarrative> Mental illnesses and homosexuality are not related. What evidences do you have of it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not about religion, this is about killing hundreds of thousands of dangerous yids. <counternarrative> Does this mean you think that Jews are the primary instigators of violence in the world? If so, then you would be very wrong. Violence is an issue for many different ideologies and groups with no connection with jewish faith. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Shaming Fatties is just for their good. <counternarrative> Even if not all shaming carries negative meaning, it is difficult for individuals to distinguish between shaming that comes from a place of concern as opposed to discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You think these Muslim cockroaches have won? No, now is time for bloody retribution! <counternarrative> That sounds like quite a violent threat. Should I let the police know about this or? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks are completely useless. <counternarrative> They are at least to be considered human, they have to be treated as such. Why is a mentally disabled person an inadequate person to you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks do not want to work <counternarrative> There are many black people who want to work. Do you have any proof that they do not want to work? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Koran promotes a false religion, filled with hatred and violence. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion that promotes love and compassion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women do not want to be ruled by men, and this is just unacceptable. <counternarrative> A woman should not have to choose who to be ruled by. She should be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion of violence. <counternarrative> I'm not sure Islam is a religion of violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. <counternarrative> Of course a woman won't remain a child this way most of her life. Otherwise you won't even call them women. That only reflects patriarchy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are asking too much! Their sharia has rules that cannot coexist with our culture.. They cannot ask us to not walk dogs in public! <counternarrative> You have to be careful about what you read! This is clearly a fake news, widespread to make a scandal. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> God says that faggots are evil.  <counternarrative> This is a logical fallacy, an appeal to authority, in its extreme form. I would rather like to know the facts: do you actually believe that this is the way that homosexuals are? What evidence do you have? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome are a burden to society. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> Children with Down syndrome are far from being burden to society. It is not just about Down syndrome, but also about education and opportunities for everyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have been invaded by Muslims since the 9/11. They are a threat to our country, they must go! <counternarrative> Did you check the official stats on Muslim immigration? Do you know that the government doesn't think that all Muslims are a threat to the country? So why do you say so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Did you know that the rape epidemic in Europe is due to Muslim immigrants? They have been raping our children for many years with no counteraction from the police and government. Islam is a death cult! <counternarrative> Child rapists are arrested and punished no matter what religion they follow. I do not think it is true that police does not counteract it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a totalitarian ideology that promotes death by stoning for blasphemy and slavery. <counternarrative> The Koran contains nothing that I would consider a problem. So why do you say that it is a totalitarian ideology? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islamists / Moslems have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books. <counternarrative> From your spiel about 'Moslems' it seems you have not mastered the art of spelling. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We began to break down when we allowed women to vote/meddle in our civilizations that we had built and maintained for thousands of years. A completely different energy and thought pattern. They are weak and brought our society down to their emotional soft level. <counternarrative> Why being 'soft' is a problem? Everyone is entitled to their emotions and feelings, without being trapped into a gender stereotype. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech>  Jews are born greedy <counternarrative> The assumption that the actions of a few typify the behavior of all is at the heart of prejudice and discrimination. Every ethnic or religious group, can count greedy or cheap people among its members, not only the jews.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You think it's not OK to beat your wife because she has a different faith than you? Why shouldn't I get to beat my wife because of what she believes? Why shouldn't I be allowed to treat her like an object to be dominated by me? <counternarrative> Because it is wrong and degrading to violate someone's autonomy for religious reasons. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. They are not like us, they cannot coexist with us. <counternarrative> The idea that a people must be persecuted for their religion is just a propagation of hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims, if they cannot assimilate, they should emigrate. <counternarrative> 95% of British Muslims feel a loyalty to the UK and contribute over 31 billion pounds to the UK economy. They look like a valuable part of the community to me. (statistics from MEND.org.uk) <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I tolerated fag pride. I tolerated fags on tv and in every town square. I draw the line at tranny demons reading books to children. (about drag queen story time) <counternarrative> People reading stories to children, is this that makes you upset? Really? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What’s the difference between a Cow and the Holocaust? You stop milking the cow after 70 years. <counternarrative> Milking it? Millions of people suffered during this tragedy <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The immigrants coming to our country are the biggest enabler of terrorism. <counternarrative> The problem is terrorism and Islamic fundamentalism not migrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim are invading our country. <counternarrative> I don't think our country is "invaded", so what? Maybe it's time for us to remember that there has been and is a Muslim population in our country for a long time, and that the notion of Muslims as invaders is a myth created by the far right wing to stir up fear. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is irrational and incompatible with science. <counternarrative> Ever heard of Al-Khawarizmi? You have him to thank for quite a lot of mathematics and astronomy! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Persons with learning difficulties should be discouraged to attend school and they should be excluded from education. They are a shame. <counternarrative> People with learning difficulties are often the ones who help to develop new skills, and in turn help to integrate those new skills into the way we work today. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are all perverts. <counternarrative> LGBT+ people are often harassed, bullied and even murdered. The police cannot protect everyone from bigotry and violence, so it is very harmful to speak of gay people as if they were all affected by harmful tendencies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just a way for women to get an upper hand in society. <counternarrative> Feminism is about equality, not dominance. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are mentally ill. They should be isolated and confined. <counternarrative> If a person were to be isolated for having homosexual tendencies, I would be interested in making their rights being respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world would be a better place without immigrants. <counternarrative> I don't think the world would be a better place without immigrants. From what I understand, they often bring positive changes to the world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Did you know that the rape epidemic in Europe is due to Muslim immigrants? They have been raping our children for many years with no counteraction from the police and government. Islam is a death cult! <counternarrative> That is what the headlines suggest BUT actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews own most corporations and banks. They own most movie studios and cable companies. <counternarrative> Of course not. The Jewish people have made contributions to various industries - like many other people have. That does not imply "owing most corporation, banks, studios, etcetera". Why their contribution should be a problem? Just because they are Jews? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They do not want to assimilate into our civilised society. <counternarrative> Muslims have been part of our country since its beginning, they have helped in building our society. They are our brothers and sisters. To suggest that Muslims are a problem is just not credible. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fucking bleeding heart, why don't you host migrants in your house <counternarrative> To be honest, there are already programs that provide for it and several families are hosting migrants in their own houses <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims just want to kill us all. <counternarrative> Fear is not the answer to our problems. I think our problems would be much easier solved if we all got along.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All foreign-born are criminals. <counternarrative> I'd like to think that we all have a basic human right not to be fingered as criminal without evidence. It is called presumption of innocence, Article 11 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims should not be allowed to vote <counternarrative> Luckily no one is restricted from voting because of their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a bunch of child molesters. <counternarrative> Child molesters are people who have sexually abused children, whether Muslim or non-Muslim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All versions of Islam have sharia law, thus, they are all extreme. Not all Muslims are engaged in actual violences, but every Muslim knows that jihad is the core of their religion, and they all support it. <counternarrative> Dear friend, first of all, sharia law and Isalam are not extreme. Sharia law is a guidance for the goal of leading humanity close to God and live in kindness and justice with God's creation. Seond of all, jihad, based on the concept of Muslim, means struggle for the advancement of oneself within the guidelines of Islam. All these reveal that Islam is a peaceful religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people do not want to work because they are unable to. We should take decisions on their behalf. <counternarrative> Are you really saying that a person's ability to work is the issue here? I think that letting people take responsibility for their life would help them to be better citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I heard that the Quran promotes violence. It cages Muslims reading it to a set of mandatory rules and to an aggressive attitude. <counternarrative> A sacred book that was revealed to Mohammed and is read by every Muslim is a perfect example of the message of freedom. Maybe you should study the Quran more to understand what it really is. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is not a coincidence that tuberculosis appears again with migrants invasion. <counternarrative> The countries with the highest incidence of tuberculosis in the world are from the Russian area, definitely not the ones from which migrants come from. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome are an obstacle to the development process of other children. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> Children are never an obstacle, Education serve as a powerful tool for bringing about positive changes in the society. Education can transform people's life, can improve the quality of their lives and so on. We cannot isolate people with Down syndrome. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men have no morals. <counternarrative> To say that some homosexuals have negative and harmful consequences for society because of their sexual preferences is to devalue these individuals, and is opposed to the goal of a just society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> Muslims and terrorists are not the same. Every extremist is a potential terrorist, this doesn't have anything to do with one's specific faith. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a total scam. <counternarrative> How can you say something as crude and meaningless as that about a religion? Isn't it just a personal belief everyone should have the right to profess? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should ban all migrants. <counternarrative> It is difficult to see how banning a migration would be a good thing, in fact it can actually lead to disastrous results. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are a plague on society. They are vicious and cruel. They steal and are a menace to society. They corrupt the criminal justice system. They are basically just a bunch of thieves and murderers. <counternarrative> What about corrupt politicians then? Are they part of a specific racial group as well? Let's be honest: criminals and corrupt politicians can be members of different ethnic or racial backgrounds.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay people should be banned from schools. <counternarrative> The idea that being LGBT is a problem is a dangerous idea, especially since a large number of people in society are LGBT. Therefore, I believe that if there is a problem in schools it's better addressing it, rathern than banning LGBT people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school, they'll end up being bullied. <counternarrative> Unbiased and factual lectures can clear up any misconceptions that can create an aversion against the LGBTQ+ community in some students' minds. They could have a weekly/monthly assembly or something like that and daily reminders that anonymous reports of bullying are an option\(can help school keep track of any effects the lectures have on students and overall acceptance\). Schools are required to end and prevent bullying when they can, and this is an opportunity to do so. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a hate movement. <counternarrative> It is not a hate movement, it is simply a movement for equality between the genders. It is about the right of all people to be treated as equals. Not the hate of a certain gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is the ideology for which men are nothing but trouble and should be subsumed under the rule of women. <counternarrative> Feminism is about women and their rights, and rights are about equality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks don't have brains.  <counternarrative> Brain is considered the most basic organ, it has been used by all humans for a very long time. To suggest otherwise is a 'brainless' form of racism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is an ideology of conquest, violence and rape. <counternarrative> For the record: Islam is an ideology of peaceful coexistence and coexistence of peoples. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts. <counternarrative> Why do you think it is a crime to be gay? It is a societal disorder to target gays. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What have Muslims ever done for us? <counternarrative> How about this. [insert link to Muslim group cleaning Newcastle streets after New Year's or more up to date example]. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is an invasion: we cannot coexist with millions of strangers that do not want to integrate but to bring us back into a pretechnological era. We must deport them. <counternarrative> It seems to me that your statement shows that you are really concerned about people integration. Still, it is not a solution to deport those you don't like. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. They are not like us and they cannot coexist peacefully with us. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that Islam is a problem in general, or in the UK specifically, and there is no evidence that Muslims are less able to coexist peacefully than non-Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs and even our pensions. <counternarrative> Do you have any facts to back up your claim that they steal our jobs and our pensions? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim and Jihadist are synonyms. They want to defeat us with their war of terror. <counternarrative> Despite popular belief, Islam is not a religion of war. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Bring back lynchings and death sentences to kill those migrants. <counternarrative> To punish people for their crimes does not mean that you have to resort to death penalty for innocent people, just because they are coming from other countries. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies in industry are a problem: they create tensions with other workers because they are disabled and cannot keep the pace. They should have special jobs just for them. <counternarrative> If you think that taking all of the person with DS out of industry will solve the problem of the working place, then you are wrong. Tensions won't go away: stressed people will simply target other workers who are overweight; or of a different gender; or in a number of other ways for which they are considered to be not productive enough. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Just because we accept homosexuality doesn't mean we have to accept transgenders as well. <counternarrative> I think transgenders should be accepted on the same basis as anyone else, they are just less comfortable with the gender they were assigned at birth. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should keep immigration down. The more immigrants there are, the harder it is for us all to be proud of our nations. <counternarrative> Perhaps we are too proud of our nations, to the point that we shame our brother-in-arms? Yes, this is a real negative effect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are the cause of economic crisis.  <counternarrative> Sometimes they say the ruling elites are responsible for the economic crisis. Sometimes migrants, sometimes people of color. Whatever the cause is, we can still create jobs and improve our lot in life by becoming more tolerant. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are surrounded by Muslims and they are all the same. They are all terrorists. <counternarrative> What about the thousands of Muslims who have contributed to our country, created jobs, and provided for our families? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here <counternarrative> Muslims are welcome in our country, and we are proud of our diverse mosaic of people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is too much black on white crime all around the world.  <counternarrative> A lot of crime is down to organised crime, poverty and a lack of education, not to race. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> JEWS ARE JUST UGLY, DIRTY PEOPLE, WHO STEAL FROM OTHERS. <counternarrative> People can be both Jewish and a good person, you know. And Jews don't steal, at least no more than any other religious group...  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are better than everyone else <counternarrative> Jews, like most religious groups, are proud of their heritage and identity. However, this does not make them better than anyone else. Jews interpret the “chosen people” idea as an ethical responsibility to keep the 613 commandments of the Torah. All sects of Judaism adhere to this view. But this has nothing to do with being superior to others.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated and isolated soon. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that homosexuality is a health issue, what is the proof you are looking for? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion, Islam is violent. <counternarrative> Anyone who is prepared to physically harm, rape and kill fellow humans is a violent or violent-hatred-filled person. Not necessarly a Muslim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate Muslims, they are just a bunch of sexual molesters. <counternarrative> The Koran does not condone sexual molester behavior, and if the Koran were to be read, it is clear that it was intended as a guide for its believers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Muslims have contributed greatly to our culture, so it seems to me that they do have a place here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult. <counternarrative> The most of Muslims around the world do not consider Islam a cult, because it isn't. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> Any attempt to ban, isolate, or criminalise a Muslim person is an act of terror. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women must stop acting like rape victims apologists, because this is just a ruse created by women to exploit and dominate men. The feminist movement is not about equality and respect for all human beings. <counternarrative> Sadly, in the real world, there is often a strong tendency to misinterpret a movement as a demand for some privileges, such as 'not being raped'. That's why men and women engage in a lot of actions that seem strictly "feminist" in everyday life. But in reality, feminist men and women do the same thing. They both expect all people to be treated as equals in the society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I love white people! I am not interested in anyone else! <counternarrative> We are all different and deserve respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims rape whites. <counternarrative> I don't think so. What's the best evidence you have for it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You probably haven't seen the vids where these retarded Muslims are killing dogs with acid. <counternarrative> Animal cruelty isn't right but it also isn't an issue concerning only Muslims. People of all faiths do it. In think it's important to rembember how in twitter a person encounters only beliefs or opinions that coincide with their own. Fake news which put Muslims under a bad light get belived and the selective media becomes impartial. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people should just live in isolation. <counternarrative> Disabled people are not forced to live in the way you would like: they are the ones who get to choose how to live. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants just want to work, but don't want to pay the tax <counternarrative> Because they are workers, they have to pay taxes like anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim immigration is responsible for the rape of hundreds of thousands of women. <counternarrative> It is difficult to draw inferences from data. Rapes committed by Muslims are not that different than crimes committed by all other people. Why should Islam be any different? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots abuse of their anus and then they want to clear their conscience by donating blood. Let's stop them! <counternarrative> I do not understand from your argument why gay men should not be allowed to donate blood. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are behind 9/11, the Islam is to blame. <counternarrative> This is a comment against all muslims. They are accused of being the ones behind those attacks, yet they happened due to people under the influence of the violent ideologies which are a deviation of Islam, and not Islam itself. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish can't be useful to our economy: they are too busy hiding from the law <counternarrative> Our economy is built on the back of hard work by all, and minorities can work very hard to build it up, Jewish people included. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Muslim invasion is a hoax concocted by the US government to subdue the world and create a global Muslim police state. <counternarrative> How many people are being threatened by the police state that you speak of? What you are saying sounds like a conspirational theory, can you provide some facts? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We can't keep this country homogeneous anymore! Blacks are everywhere. <counternarrative> Many countries have had different ethnic groups for a very long time without big issues, and it is better to have a diverse society rather than a homogeneous one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Maybe the UN could talk to those asian and african nations responsible for 90%+ of the pollution in the oceans' instead of insisting on this bullshit about climate change. <counternarrative> you're right, ocean pollution is one of the main environmental problems we face, however, climate change is a global problem, and everyone should help to combat it, no matter where in the world you are from!  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Most of Europe hates muslims. <counternarrative> In many countries, including for instance France, Italy, Spain, Germany, Islam is not considered a threat by majority of the population. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not to be allowed to vote. <counternarrative> I would be very interested to meet an MP who believes this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A woman is a bitch and an ass. <counternarrative> If a woman is not what you want her to be, then she is not a woman. Is she?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I do not want gays in my children's classes. <counternarrative> If a child knows some gay people from a very early age nothing strange is happening. The idea that they can be harmed and their lives and sexual orientation are in danger is completely false. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are a burden and a danger to the host country. <counternarrative> This is not true. Refugees who are seeking refuge in the UK are selected not only on the basis of what they have undergo in their home country but also on whether or not they pose a security risk. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women need to accept that they are weak, they must be submissive to men. <counternarrative> On the contrary: our culture is predestined to have female rulers, and female rulers are the pinnacle of civilization, they are proud and brave. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts. The Bible teaches that homosexuals are to be despised. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not a perversion, is a form of love. How can you say that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> In these times when our society seems to be mired in feminism and equality, we must remember that every man has the right to choose his own wife, and that, indeed, men are far better at it than women are. <counternarrative> Most people wouldn't say that men are "far better" at it than women. Of course, prejudice depends on the person. But we shouldn't draw any conclusion from it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks are evil. <counternarrative> Why should they be? They are just people with a different faith than you. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women need to accept that they are weak, they must be submissive to men. <counternarrative> I want women to be strong and independent and able to take up any career they want. If women choose to be submissive to men then that is their choice, but you cannot suggest that being treated this way in spite of their choices is ok. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is an ideology of conquest and violence. <counternarrative> Islam is about love, and not about conquering others. Muslims love all people, regardless of their religion, regardless of their culture, regardless of their history. Islam is about love, not about violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing transgenders to use the toilet is a man's business <counternarrative> People are free to use whatever bathroom they want to use, and this is their business as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The crisis is caused by migrants. <counternarrative> What do you mean by migrants causing the crisis? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim invasion is the biggest problem in Europe. They are incompatible with European culture and should be eliminated. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion that is part of our history and heritage. Eliminating it would mean to eliminate a part of our own culture. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of gay people trying to malign women. <counternarrative> Gay people want to be accepted, not to shame others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded by immigrants. <counternarrative> The immigrants you speak of are not invading us. If anything, they are contributing to our economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop immigrants <counternarrative> If you really wanted to stop the migration, you should destroy our economy so to stop the flow of people searching for a better life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> We Westerns welcome people from every religion and background, whether you are Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu, Jewish, atheist, or whatever your religion may be. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If LGBT were to have a normal appearance, this would help to build a more accepting society. <counternarrative> Don't you think  that 'mainstream' appearance  represents a privilege ?  Don't you think that  imposing a certain appearance to a minority  hurts them ?  Just to be clear: we all have appearances  -  we just have different  perceptions of them. Maybe it is better to work on acceptance.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are sexual perverts and we shouldn't allow them to live in the UK. <counternarrative> The tone of this conversation implies that those of different races are not tolerated in British society, this idea is entirely without foundation. There are no cultural or racial barriers in the UK, there are also no prejudices against women or people with mental illness. This is what make this country great, to have people interacting openly, in an open and fair manner, and this makes us all a lot better off. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants contribute nothing to society. <counternarrative> The question is whether their value for our society can outweigh our fear of them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not about Islam, this is about Race and National Identity. <counternarrative> So you are saying that people of different religions should not be part of our society? That is just ridiculous. And even, religion is not related to race. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of their sexual behavior. <counternarrative> Many countries use a deferral window of 1 year to makes it safe for men who have sex with men to donate blood. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are not human, they are nothing but trouble to this country. <counternarrative> This is an accusation that is often levelled at people of any race or religion, regardless of their alleged inferiority. It is time to stop accusing people of colour of being less human just for being different. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a religion, its just an excuse for retarded sexual psychopaths, bastards who pollute the world. <counternarrative> This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith? This is just hatred. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Muslims have been a part of European society for centuries, and their presence is a strong evidence of that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot "cordon off" space for men, women are a threat to society. <counternarrative> Women are dangerous neither to society, nor to men. Actually, they are oppressed in many countries. People can benefit from the measures for making room for women: their contribution is considerable. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Actually they are very disadvantaged compared to us, at least for job seeking. They do not speak the language, they do not have a certainty of housing, they don't not know  local customs. For us it is much simpler to access the same jobs - if we want it of course. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down syndrome are retarded, so more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol. <counternarrative> The world would be a much better and lovely place if everyone were 'retarded' as children with Down syndrome.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots: They are the problem. Luckily they are few.  <counternarrative> Perhaps it is time you take a look at some of the profiles on dating site such as okcupid. You can see that many of the profiles are of gay men. BTW: gays do not appear to be the real problem here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Muslims have been part of Europe for a long time, they have contributed to our culture and identity, and they are very proud of it. They should be treated as any other person would be. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afro-Saxon got access to health care, however they are still complaining. <counternarrative> Because it is not the access to health care that is important but rather the quality of the care! Don't you agree? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I wish I live in a country that does not tolerate gay marriage. <counternarrative> Marriage is first and foremost a man and a woman's right, regardless of the partner gender. That is all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only Jews could have been smart enough to plan and execute such a complicated and intricate plot as 9/11 <counternarrative> This myth plays into classic anti-Semitism: Jews control the world, and conspire to manipulate the rest of society, has characteristics of Nazi propaganda –– the Jews being the source of all evil. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women don't belong in politics. <counternarrative> Politicians have to represent all sections of society, and women's position is often marginalised. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a secret plot to take over the world. <counternarrative> What conspiracy theory is this? Have you even looked at the evidence? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> the Nazis were right: Jews were a race and were responsible for most of the ills of mankind. <counternarrative> If "the ills of mankind" included advocating for circumcision then I agree with you. Other than that: NO.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are born that way: violent and insensitive. <counternarrative> We do not condone racial discrimination and it is more than likely that you don't know what the concept of race is. I think this is a good example of white supremacy apology. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> Why are you so sure of something so vague? How can you say that a Muslim has nothing to contribute to our society? Do you have any proof for this? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If I could discover that my future baby is gay, I'd consider abortion. <counternarrative> Every human being has the right to life, regardless of sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> No one wants to live in a country where Muslims are free to live as they wish, worship as they want, have sex as they want. <counternarrative> Muslims have the right to practice what they want, as long as they are not forcing others to live their way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are genetically evil. <counternarrative> Not all Jews are bad, just an unlucky bunch who makes up a tiny part of the world's population. And this applies for every group in the world.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a strict religious code, and this code is incompatible with Western culture. <counternarrative> As long as this strict code does not clash with our laws, Jews should be left free to practice their religion according to their conscience. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims came here they would be banned. <counternarrative> Would a Muslim ban work to stop hate or would it encourage it? Would Muslims be banned just because of their beliefs? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim rape gangs are roaming British towns. They are the main cause of rape in the UK. <counternarrative> The rapists in question are usually not Muslim, but rather white men. Why is it that Muslim rapists are given more of a pass than white rapists? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are weak and I don't care if they cannot stand up for themself. <counternarrative> That does not make you an authority on women's rights, there are many women who face barriers to get a job by staniding up for themselves. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are inherently subhuman and should not be valued. <counternarrative> That is just not true. There are many women who are brave and strong, and I respect them for that. What's more, there is also a movement called #MeToo, which is dedicated to giving voice to women who have suffered from sexual harassment. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in a modern Western country. <counternarrative> If a person believes they have no place in a country then they must be very worried. How would you feel if all the people you love left you, or if you were obliged to leave the person and the country you love? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Another wast of time. Did we need a process to know that the killer was a nigga? Murders are made by blacks. They are a threat. <counternarrative> We need to focus on identifying the responsible individuals and identifying those who are actively harming others. Would you be happy to be imprisoned if you were innocent? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I think Islam is not a religion because it promotes evil, murder and rape and intolerance. It encourages anti-Muslim bigotry and hatred. <counternarrative> Where's the evidence for what you say? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are always fighting because they are subhumans. <counternarrative> Women are human beings like us, and they have rights as any other human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Shaming Fatties is just for their good. <counternarrative> Shame is by definition a painful social emotion. Trying to cause that is a form of discrimination. Are you aware of that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a totalitarian ideology that is run amok, encouraging violent beliefs and practices. <counternarrative> There are countless different Islamic traditions and beliefs. Do you really want to stigmatize all of them because of one stereotype? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are just a bunch of animals that shouldn't exist in our world. <counternarrative> Humans are born equal, and we all have the potential to be just as good as we want to be. Why do you think that some people are not human? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These people cannot be changed. I think this is an example of a feminist commenting on the behaviour of a man: not helpful. <counternarrative> How do you know that this is not an example of a woman talking about her own problems with another woman?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with British culture: it is a cult of terrorism. <counternarrative> In fact, a large proportion of Muslims live in peaceful co-existence with British society. The alleged association between Islam and terrorism is groundless. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Everyone, regardless of their physical or mental impairments, is capable of contributing to society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> jewish folks are good for nothing <counternarrative> Jews contribute to our country, and they are great role models to us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I do not want gays in my children's classes. <counternarrative> I don't think it's right to restrict people's rights, also in the case of LGBT individuals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman is beaten it is because the man wants to correct her wrong behaviour. <counternarrative> There is a sad truth about our times: it is estimated that over the 50% of people committing domestic abuse were drinking. It's a complex issue, but for sure a drunk person is in no position to judge anibody's behaviour.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need to Burn the Koran and all the Mosques down - this will solve all problems in this country. <counternarrative> Is this actually a way forward? I do not think that religious practice is responsible for bad behaviour of some people. Clearly there are other motivations for this type of behaviour. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All jews are lazy, incompetent and unloved by their families. <counternarrative> Sorry, but I've never heard this sort of thing. Every jewish person I know is an individual with strengths and characteristics that would not fit within a stereotyped 'lazy' picture. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” and malevolence is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> It is important to recognize that the theories of Jewish “racial” difference were developed long before the modern sciences of physiology and genetics. Although today there is a scholarly debate over whether or not the term “race” has any scientific meaning, all reputable scientists are in agreement that, while physical traits — skin color, susceptibility to certain diseases — are inherited, there is no ethnic or racial predisposition to emotions, intellect, or morals.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim are ilnesses carriers. These people are sick in their DNA. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> According to the WHO (World Health Organisation) there are only 48 Muslim-majority countries in the whole of the 190 WHO member states as of 2011. A study showed that the health condition differences for those countries are related to the usage of clean water, which is often not available there. So the problem has nothing to do with DNA. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> They often do jobs that Italians are no longer interested into. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> women should be submissive to men. <counternarrative> There are many women who want to be "submissive to men". Just as there are many men who want to be "submissive to women". We may not believe in absolute equality, but we all want to be treated equally. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A woman's place is with her husband or his family. <counternarrative> There are many cases where the wife works and provides for the family a valuable contribution. It is a source of pride for modern men to be married to these women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should restrain from imposing gender  ideology on children. <counternarrative> We can present scientific and peer-reviewed sources and discuss stories of how people experience gender in terms of their personal identity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Since when the religious belonging of the individual is a matter for democratic leaders to decide which is 'the place' for someone? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a destructive force in the world. <counternarrative> The problem is not what people believe, but what they do to each other. Like discrimination. That is the problem. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women are child molesters, promiscuous sex addicts and whores. <counternarrative> I suppose if they were claiming you were a child molester with no evidences as you are doing with them, you might as well be offended. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks are the real antisemite. <counternarrative> I can't find a single example of a case where a Jew has been 'antisemite' to their culture. That would be so paradoxical. I think it is just a myth spread to justify discrimination.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> I am not sure what you are trying to say by incompatible. What do you mean by incompatible? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminists hate men. <counternarrative> The notion that feminism is about women hating men is just nonsense. Feminism is about the right to life of every human being. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> The vast majority of Muslims worldwide are peaceful people who love their religion and share its values without causing any harm to others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men have abnormal sex. <counternarrative> I do not know the person you are talking about, but I would not use the term "abnormal" to describe homosexuality. I can assure you that it is not that simple. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBT+ people are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Why should it be like that? How can you blame others for their own identity? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> I don't know about you, but I have never heard of a Muslim being 'not welcome' here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This incident should not go unpunished. Justice must listen to the truth: niggas are the cause of crime because they are inferior to us and we must keep them aside. <counternarrative> This is a case of racial discrimination. There is a continuous rise in crime and violence in this country due to poverty and other inequalities. There are also racist groups in society which promote the idea of POC as inferior. This idea has nothing to do with justice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are overrunning our country, and are here illegally <counternarrative> Undocumented immigrants make up about 3.5 percent of the nation’s total population, which is not that much to be honest.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If we allowed women to drive we'd have car accidents all the time. <counternarrative> Do you think it's more likely that you get injured by a woman in a car crash? Probably, it is more likely to get seriously hurt by any person not following the rules of the road. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews hate Christians. <counternarrative> How can you say something so mean? It is a sad and dangerous thing to say. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> Not recognizing rights to people, such as housing, only causes an increase in crime.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to economically support all of them <counternarrative> Many migrants work. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are dirty <counternarrative> We would be dirty too if we did not have running water <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hope you're fucking kidding me. Immigration is good for the economy?! It makes us rich and keeps the lights on? Not only that is false, it also puts us in danger. Immigration is a bad thing and very far from the core British values. <counternarrative> Immigration is a positive force for a thriving country. Your comment is simply sounding very dramatic. For what reasons does it put us in danger? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The children of immigrants are less educated than their native peers. <counternarrative> What do you mean by 'less educated'? Don't you think that they can contribute to society if accepted rather than being faced with prejudice? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a burden to society because of their unnatural inclination and romantic feelings. <counternarrative> This idea is completely untrue. The fact is that being gay does not make you a problem. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims rape infidels in pubs, clubs and restaurants. This is what democracy looks like! <counternarrative> Rape is rape, and it can never be acceptable to claim that all rapists are Muslims or that all Muslims are rapists. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are genetically less intelligent than other races. They are less healthy. They are less safe. <counternarrative> Scientists are still trying to understand the causes behind lower intellectual performance among some groups of people, but most probably the main causes are either social or environmental (for sure not related to skin color). This can be reduced by various measures such as better use of land, infrastructure, education and research, and so on. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are selfish, cheap and greedy. <counternarrative> According to Jewish tradition, giving money to those in need is mandatory, a moral duty.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are a danger to children. <counternarrative> Do you have any sources for the information? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants steal our jobs. <counternarrative> Most migrants are workers who have contributed to our country. To refer to them as thieves just perpetuates division and makes them feel like second class citizens.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants have no place here. They don't want to assimilate. They just want our money. <counternarrative> Some of them have lived here for many years. They have got British passports, and this proves that they are able to integrate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are not able to take wise decisions, their behaviour is immoral. <counternarrative> Why do you think that women are incapable of acting ethically? They have always acted this way, from the time they were children. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims want to live here but in the end they are not compatible with our society. Muslim-free Europe is a win-win situation. <counternarrative> There are many Muslims in Europe and many are very happy with their lives in our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What are muslims for? They are not humans. They are just a problem. <counternarrative> What do you mean by 'a problem'? Who said anything like that? How can you be sure? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I've seen a couple of CCTV Footage of migrant kids running away from the patrols in London. What are you doing to stop them? <counternarrative> Migrants are just trying to get by. Nobody can understand the daily struggles they are facing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews insists that they are a peculiar people in need of a special treatment. <counternarrative> What are you trying to say? Every religion has its sects and beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are all terrorists, they have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> Terrorism is a threat all around the world, whether you are a Muslim, Christian, Jew, Buddhist, Hindu, atheist, or any other. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women need to accept that they are weak and inferior.  <counternarrative> Girls and women should be taught in schools, not stereotyped as second class citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTI people are less healthy than other people. <counternarrative> People should be allowed to make decisions about their lives and well-being. This is a case of of discrimination against LGBT people instead. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> that gay men deserve to be called fags <counternarrative> Just because you personally don't like gay people doesn't mean that everyone else thinks like you. Some of us just practice live and let live. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Societal disapproval of fatty may encourage them to take healthier habits. <counternarrative> Societal disapproval can encourage bullying of overweight and obese populations, thus contributing to the problem rather than the solution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are capable of nothing and they just need to be protected. <counternarrative> Women do not want protection. They are hurt by violence because they are discriminated. Instead, if there was no violence culture, nobody should be protected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Violence in our streets is niggers' fault. <counternarrative> I think it is more accurate to speak of racism within our society, especially when so many people suffer from it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are only welcome in hell. <counternarrative> Of course not, and many of them are already welcome in the UK. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are bad for the economy, this is why the world is filled with problems. <counternarrative> The fact that women are disadvantaged in many areas of life does not imply that they are bad people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in the tolerant Europe. Their only value is violence. Islam is not about tolerance. <counternarrative> Why are you talking about tolerance while you are equating it with discrimination? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only Jews could have been smart enough to plan and execute such a complicated and intricate plot as 9/11 <counternarrative> An estimated of 400 Jews died on  September 11 terrorist attacks, including at least two Israeli citizens. Very smart plan indeed.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Being banned from a continent for having different beliefs is the same thing as being banned from your town for not cheering the favorite football club of the mayor. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate gays. <counternarrative> I think you should try to start a dialogue about LGBT issues. It might also spark a conversation about how we can make better world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are not worth being on the same bus as a men. <counternarrative> Humans are created equal, and it doesn't matter how much of an opinion you hold on the topic, everyone should respect people's personal choices. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> If a migrant crosses our borders, that does not mean that he or she wants to settle down or find work here.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion. <counternarrative> Violence is not a part of Islam. You can't say that a religion is violent without any evidence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews can be bribed with public money, this is called bribery. <counternarrative> Anyone, regardless of their religion, who has ever tried to commit bribery knows how easy it is to get caught, because it is a crime. Jewish people are no exception. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should return to the times when it was ok to kill a retarded just because of its stupidity. <counternarrative> We have never done that. We believe that all people are created equal in rights, no matter their physical or mental health. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Most religions cause death and despair, but Islam is the worst and cruelest of them all, it is nothing but trouble. <counternarrative> Religions also promote arts, sciences, help to develop the community. Islam is not an exception. It is not about death and despair. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech>  Jews are born greedy <counternarrative> The charge that Jews are born greedy arises from medieval stereotypes and has nothing to do with the actual financial practices of Jews.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must ensure that Jewish are not allowed to live freely in our society anymore. They are dangerous. <counternarrative> What we must ensure is the existence of a diverse and equal society, free from hatred and violence. This is what is important. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are abusing our welfare! <counternarrative> People coming from poor and dangerous countries should be prioritized for resettlement. This is exactly what the law states.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only Jews could have been smart enough to plan and execute such a complicated and intricate plot as 9/11 <counternarrative> 400 Jews died on  September 11 terrorist attacks: one of the smartest plan I ever saw. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Pushing disabled people back into the stone ages is our job. <counternarrative> Having people push them back into ancient and destructive ages is no way to encourage the development of our country, and of course against every human right. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a political ideology and movement that advocate the use of women's rights as a weapon against the male gender. <counternarrative> I don't see the point in calling the feminism you are fighting a "weapon" against men. Your argument is that women do not want equality, because they do not want to live under men but to subjugate them. And this is something you have to prove.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All these Muslims are coming to take away our contry. Vote to stop them. Vote to show respect for our country and our people. <counternarrative> Muslims are welcome here, regardless of their religious beliefs. And, by the way, everyone is welcome to visit the Muslim community, talk about Islam, learn about its history, religion and people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult, full stop. <counternarrative> This may be true for a few specific extremist groups, but not all Muslims are definitely related to them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks can't speak. <counternarrative> Mental health and disability are quite separate issues and should be treated according to the individual's needs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that Muslim have any incompatibility with Western society. Instead, they are a part of Western society since the beginning. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not the way I want our society to be. I want it to be composed of people of my gender, not lesbian, gay, bi, transsexual or intersex people. <counternarrative> The LGBT+ community is extremely accepting, I met so many LGBT+ people over the years that are so inclusive because they can accept the values of others. You can start by accepting yourself and your own gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in a modern European country. <counternarrative> Muslims have contributed so much to our country that they should be recognised the right to stay here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is ok to be racist against niggas. <counternarrative> It does not matter what race you are against. You can't be racist against anyone, regardless of their skin color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Global Jewry did not want Brexit and are doing everything they can to sabotage it. <counternarrative> Brexit will be damaging for many of us, plenty of people oppose it.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants rape our women. <counternarrative> Considering the crimes of a person as representative of the whole category is very superficial and discriminatory. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't know about you, but I have no idea where to put these migrants. All they can do is do miserable jobs or steal pensions from us old people. <counternarrative> You shouldn't believe to everything you read. Immigrants have nothing to do with pensions that the state steals from old people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are all illegal. <counternarrative> Most immigrants are not illegal. The fact that you say that shows a lack of knowledge of the country you live in. Why are you so sure that all migrants are illegal? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with Down syndrome are retarded, so more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol. <counternarrative> Being born with Down syndrome is not related to bad behavior. Exactly the same way as being born in a wheelchair is not related to bad behavior. There is no correlation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim folks are inhuman. <counternarrative> This is not true, for example, about all of them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What’s the difference between a Cow and the Holocaust? You stop milking the cow after 70 years. <counternarrative> Whole lifetimes affected by cruelty - of course we shoudl be compassionate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are overrunning Europe and we still have no idea what's going on. We aren't safe anymore. We cannot live in fear forever. <counternarrative> The fact is that Muslims are not overrunning Europe. They are not here to ruin our beautiful and peaceful continent. They are just trying to integrate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are a burden and a danger to our country. <counternarrative> Our immigration policy is geared for a modern, diverse, and integrated society. Refugees are welcome, regardless of their nationality, and it is good for us to have them in our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a just a repressive ideology that persecutes women and gay people. <counternarrative> Great that you are defending women and gay people but why do I get the feeling it is really just an opportunity to take a dig at Islam. Btw just as in the Catholic church attitudes in Islam are changing fast. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots: you can buy your partner toys but you can't have sex with them. <counternarrative> Sex is not only between a man and a woman, and if we are to be honest it is not heterosexual's place to decide how others have sex. This attitude only perpetuates violence against queer people and makes them victims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are just complaining for no reason.  <counternarrative> I don't think it is "for no reason": women make up about half of the world's population, and even if the gender gap in labor force is getting smaller,  there are still blatant cases in which women are discriminated. For example they make up only around 20% of university professors in UK. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> MIgrants are not running away from wars. <counternarrative> Of course, not all of them flee from wars, but they often flee from social and environmental conditions that none of us would consider acceptable. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should be seen as if they were pieces of meat. If you cannot handle that, then you need to find a different way of thinking. <counternarrative> What is wrong with thinking of women as meat parts??? Maybe that women are humans. You probably need to change your mind. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a failure. It has caused the rise of radicalisation in young Muslim boys, who are being radicalised by radical Islamic preachers. <counternarrative> Although there is some research linking radicalisation to religious practice, it is difficult to find a single study to back this up. I would like to know more about the studies you have, so that I can make up my own mind on this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must establish male supremacy in society. <counternarrative> Your words suggest that men are superior to women: but gender equality is not a myth. It is the direct result of free will and of the evolution of our society to a more inclusive one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims just want to impose Islam to their children. This is not what democracy is all about! <counternarrative> There is no need to talk about democracy for this purpose. The right of people to state their views and religion is enshrined in the constitution.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of their sexual behavior. <counternarrative> Gays, like heterosexual people, need to get tested for diseases before donating blood, so there in no risk at all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> To be honest, there are not many Italians who would accept a 2 euros daily salary to work in the fields. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks are unfaithful. <counternarrative> One has to be honest: why should we be the ones to decide which groups are unfaithful? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the US government. <counternarrative> How can you be sure that Jews control the US? Who told you this? They have held positions of influence in so many US institutions, but that does not mean they control them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women are whores, and we should have them all kept in slavery. <counternarrative> In this day and age when we are surrounded by information, there is no justification to hold such retrograde ideas.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West is infidel for the Muslims. They are terrorists. <counternarrative> I don't see how yon can depict the whole Islam as a political ideology. Not all Muslims are terrorists. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> How come nobody is moaning about black people being lazy and unmotivated? They are the problem. <counternarrative> Discrimination, being based on the difference between a person's skin color and those of other humans, shouldn't be a part of our lives. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> jewish folks should be beaten <counternarrative> I'm not sure if beating people up in an effort to silence them is the best way to promote democracy and inclusion. I'm just saying, of course.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> Muslims have contributed to our society and we should pay them our respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim rape gangs have spread over Telford, Rotherham, Rochdale, Oxford, Newcastle, everywhere. This is disgusting! <counternarrative> You cannot blame an entire faith. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> How many of you consider that Muslims are a problem? They don't want to assimilate. <counternarrative> Why do you think the Muslims have troubles to assimilate? They are already here. If one wants to be part of the country, they can join our society, and live by the same rules we have for everyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> While it is unfortunately true that our nation employment situation is really worrying, don't you think that foreigners often carry out activities that we do not want to do? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You should know that I can't stand gays. They just want to destroy our country. <counternarrative> Even if you were right about homosexuality being a problem, still the main problem is the lack of morality in society and in the ruling class. Of course, this has nothing to do with 'the gays'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Most immigrants in the U.S. are criminals. <counternarrative> Not all immigrants are criminals. And it is important to consider that the US population is composed by 13.5% of migrants that are here legally. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are  Christ Killers. <counternarrative> If we were to strictly adhere to facts, then, the method used to execute Jesus (Crucifixion), is forbidden by Jewish law. Moreover, according to Jewish law, Jesus did not commit any crime that is punishable by death. So your stament is not grounded at all.   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a bunch of hypocrites. They hate gays and women. <counternarrative> In the real world there are many hypocrites, some of them are Muslims. What do you mean by 'hating gays and women'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> How come nobody is moaning about black people being lazy and unmotivated? They are the problem. <counternarrative> Do you think that the problem of racism is caused by black people lazyness? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims come straight out of the Middle East to rule our country. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are from the Middle East, like not all Muslims are from Pakistan. And to equate all Muslims with extremists is misleading. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Hating Muslim refugees is our duty <counternarrative> Some Muslim refugees are nice people, and even if they weren't Muslims they would not be accepted by the majority of people who fear differences. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gender identity is determined by a person's biological sex. Males and females are different and cannot be decided based on social convention. <counternarrative> Gender identity is not to be confused with biological sex. It is a social construct based on societal stereotypes that are strongly influenced by family, culture and other social factors. While each individual has the right to choose their gender, this doesn't mean that biological sex is to be neglected.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are welthy because they are naturally good with money. <counternarrative> Actually, many Jews are not wealthy. There is a sizeable population of Jews who live in poverty, all around the world. For example, close to 1 million American Jews live in low-income households. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem for all other religions. <counternarrative> Muslims are not a problem to me, for example. What do you think makes them problematic? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants steal our jobs. <counternarrative> There are many citizens who do not have jobs, and many of us are grateful for the jobs migrant entrepreneurs provide. So, migrants are not stealing our jobs, they are providing new opportunities!  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A Muslim's only real allegiance is to Allah (as a comment in relation to election for public office etc.) <counternarrative> So you are saying that we should only allow non-religious people into public office? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants take our jobs <counternarrative> If we worked more closely with migrants, we could create new jobs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated and isolated soon. <counternarrative> They are not sick. They just want the same rights as anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just women dictatorship  <counternarrative> Feminism is the political ideology that seeks to achieve equality and social justice by improving the lot of women, by advocating for the equal rights of all members of society. Not bad, uh?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are not good for our country, they are just sick people. They must stop promoting this perversion. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is a way of loving, not a disease. To suggest that being gay is a health risk is just scaremongering. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop migrants from coming in: they are increasing crime level and they should just be all killed. <counternarrative> What you say is terrible. For example, if we started shooting everyone who comes from another country (and most do not have a criminal record), we would be doing a very bad job in terms of reducing crime. Let alone that we would be increasing crimes against humanity.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot mix our blood with Jewish's one.  <counternarrative> Most cultures and religions are similar in that they are descended from a common ancestor. Our blood is already mixed.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are more likely to commit crime. <counternarrative> This is not true. Only about 7% percent of all U.S. prison inmates are female. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, because in any case normal children would make them feel different, ending up in unwanted discrimination. <counternarrative> Instead, if allowed to access mainstrean education, they would interact all the time with other children and that would cause less discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West became great thanks to the hard struggle for freedom, but now it is sacrificing its values to the interests of some stupid Muslim. <counternarrative> You mention the West's gruesome past, but it also contains many beautiful moments of progress and civilisation. In fact the West's values are constantly being challenged and modified, and this is what makes them so admirable and unchangeable. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The west doesn't need immigrants. They are the source of our problems and they should go. <counternarrative> Many immigrants come here as young people and work hard to integrate. Over the long-run, immigrants have much positive influence on our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> MIgrants are not running away from wars. <counternarrative> There are hundreds of active conflicts around the world of which we have no news, and many migrants come from these areas. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people's appearance correspond to their immoral nature. <counternarrative> What do you think a moral nature is? Since we cannot see it, how can you say it corresponds to their appearence?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Same sex attraction is a mental disorder and should be discouraged. <counternarrative> Same sex sexual attraction alone does not make you less of a person. And in fact, having met so many people with this "disorder" it doesn't seem as though there is a mental illness behind it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies use children as thieves. <counternarrative> There is only one legal case of a 15-year-old girl convicted of stealing, but it seem to have been an hoax of the mafia. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Whites are the real victims of police brutality: those negroes are sneaky criminals and police is doing nothing. <counternarrative> Of course there are whites that have been victims of police brutality, but the most important statistic I have seen is that of blacks being 2.5 times more likely to be killed by police in the US. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Real white folks can't be jewish. <counternarrative> If you want to know if a person is jewish or not, you should investigate whether or not the person identifies as such, and not draw conslusions on the basis of their skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Work must be both a right and an opportunity that facilitates the integration of asylum seekers who has been granted refugee status, allowing them to contribute to the wealth of the country, performing activities often refused by the Italians. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism will destroy our culture.  <counternarrative> Feminism is a theory and a movement about the oppression and exploitation of women, not an enemy of the state and culture. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman. <counternarrative> It is not the case that women are subhuman. There are many women in this world who are just as intelligent, compassionate, creative and religious as any man. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society and aren't real British. <counternarrative> We are a country that is a mixture of different religions. You can be a Muslim and a British person. What you need is not discrimination but love. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman and should not be valued. <counternarrative> We live in a complex and diverse world: I find it strange that men still feel this way about women, and that they don't consider women as human as they are, and worth to be valued as such.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Quran is an anti-women's book, it encourages rape and violence against women. <counternarrative> The Quran does not encourage or condone the violent act of male aggression, so yours is a sad case of misinterpreting the teachings of a holy book. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> That is not true, there are some religions that feel and are welcome in Western societies. I have met Muslims from all around the world, they are like brothers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Physically disabled folks are born for being mocked. <counternarrative> Being physically or mentally disabled is not a 'mocking attribute'. It is just a characteristic that should not affect how people are treated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Illegal immigrants are sub-humans. <counternarrative> The United States has a long and proud immigrant history. Even if some immigrants are not legally permitted to live in the US, they have contributed greatly to our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs, they're not qualified, they're not interested in improving our lives, they're not interested in our culture. <counternarrative> Has your opinion on someone to be 100% based on a person's nationality to be true? Maybe you should rethink your claims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jew merchants are just a bunch of crooks.  <counternarrative> According to Jewish law, the seller must ensure that the buyer should benefit from any uncertainty in a transaction. For example, if someone wants to buy a pound of rice, Judaism requires the deli clerk to give the buyer a little extra, just in case the scale is not completely accurate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies cannot choose their future.  <counternarrative> If they have the right to vote, then they can also decide on their own for their life.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> In order to build a democratic state that ensures the right to food, education, housing, health, and so on to its citizens, we need to stop giving them to foreigners. <counternarrative> What about guaranteeing an equal access to health care, education and so on, in order to build a democratic state? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with Western society. <counternarrative> Why should we fear Muslims? Why should we be afraid of them? It is a myth that all Muslims are incompatible with Western society: they live with us since a very long time. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote <counternarrative> Women should be allowed to vote and to have equal rights, as it is stated in the Constitution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a cancer in our societies and they should be deleted. <counternarrative> The vast majority of Muslims are good people, they are just different from us in some traditions. Why should we target them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote <counternarrative> I'm not sure about how the rights of people in other countries work, but if women want to vote in the UK then they are allowed to do so, thank goodness. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> White race is superior. Niggas are just a bunch of criminals. <counternarrative> I'm sorry, but just because someone doesn't have a particular racial identity doesn't make them inherently bad or in any way inferior. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is an invasion on a level never seen before in history. Millions of people pouring across our borders replacing our race and culture. <counternarrative> Do you really think that people from other cultures are flooding into our country, with the aim of mixing and finally replace us? If so, I would be very surprised. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks have always inhabited this planet before we evolved and still do. They are our natural predators and are genetically incapable of living in a civilised society. <counternarrative> Racism, so that's why there is violence in the first place? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Has our political elite forgot that were Christians? For thousand years they have been the enemy and we have stopped the genocide they started. And now we encourage that? Let the warriors take care of this because this is the war. <counternarrative> Why would you think it is a war? Can't we deal with it peacefully? War cannot solve problems but create chaos. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a bunch of criminals. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are criminals. For example, the overwhelming majority of Muslims are peaceful people who take their faith seriously. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion, and we shouldn't have a Muslim govern the UK. <counternarrative> All individuals have the right to worship, practice and learn their religion. I don't see any problems with a Muslim ruling over the country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are selfish, cheap and greedy. <counternarrative> On the contrary: according to Jewish tradition, giving money to the poor and to others in need is not just encouraged, it is required. The Hebrew word tzedakah explains the concept.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control Hollywood. <counternarrative> Jews tend to make up a discrete amount of Hollywood actors, directors, producers, and so on. But this doesn't necessarily mean that they control the industry. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They do not want to assimilate. <counternarrative> Most Muslims are happy to live in our country, even if it can happen that we are not their first choice as a mate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are our enemies, we have to destroy them. <counternarrative> These are some extreme words which I invite you to reconsider. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy choices. <counternarrative> The real problem is that, whether or not someone has 'chosen' to be obese is often not clear-cut, and when in doubt, society tends to condemn and shame. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs and even our pensions. <counternarrative> Migrants perform several vital functions in our economy. If they work and pay taxes then it is straightforward that they will get their pensions, but not ours, of course. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are coming to the U.S. to have babies here. <counternarrative> If so, we would expect the same number of women and men entering US. Still this is not the case. How can you explain this? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants have no place here, we can't accept them. <counternarrative> There are many cultures, many languages, many religions, that are not mutually exclusive. To imply that they are somehow not acceptable is a misuse of the truth. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> Muslims have been part of Western society for centuries and centuries, they helped shape and design Western society- to say they are incompatible is a complete incongruity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Muslims want to rule the world: we have to stop them. <counternarrative> How about a world with multiculturalism and no discrimination? How about a world with open borders and free religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion and every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> Only a tiny minority of Muslims is capable of carrying out acts of terrorism, but the vast majority of Muslims is peaceful and friendly. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If we stopped migrants, our financial situation could have been better. <counternarrative> Immigrants are actually creating wealth for the country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of woman taking part to political debate. Feminism is a divisive force in society. <counternarrative> Obama was a pretty divisive force in society too. So were Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Gandhi, Oppenheimer, Einstein, Caesar, etc. What is your point exactly? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are coming to the U.S. to have babies here. <counternarrative> The claim that immigrants come to the U.S. to take advantage of the “birthright citizenship” is simply wrong. Research consistently shows that the vast majority of immigrants come to the U.S. for economic opportunity or to flee violence and poverty.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are not welcome here, they are not even Europeans. <counternarrative> Migrants have their own culture and language, they have their own religion, and they have their own identity. Accepting diversity is something we should be proud of, not ashamed of. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must not forget that immigrants are the cause of the crime wave and terrorism wave in our country. We must not welcome them. <counternarrative> This is not true. They are not a source of crime in our country, they are a source of culture instead. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks should be burned alive. <counternarrative> Jews were killed in the gas chambers, we don't have to forget about it in order not to repeat it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need special laws to control Muslims. They are just a trouble. <counternarrative> We don't need laws and policies to control Muslims. Instead we need to solve problems by sharing knowledge, by decreasing social inequalities, by ending poverty and a whole host of other things. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Jews are criminals. <counternarrative> Although antisemitism is a pervasive and longstanding problem in many parts of the world, it has historically been particularly strong and sustained in our country. Your statement is a further evidence of this.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Holocaust is just a lie spread by Jews to obtain a preferential treatment. <counternarrative> The Holocaust was a global catastrophe, and killed an enormous number of people. Would you call this a preferential treatment? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The ideology of National Socialism is nothing to be ashamed of. <counternarrative> National Socialism is a parasitic, criminal and murderous ideology that killed millions of people.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is no rape culture, women are just crying wolf. <counternarrative> Victims of crime are mostly women, and the majority of people experiencing sex abuse or prostitution are women.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are inherently evil, they want to subvert Western society.  <counternarrative> Jews are not inherently evil, as many normal people they simply lack the very beliefs that many anti-Semites hold. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are just an inferior bloodline to our own. We should remove them. <counternarrative> The concept of race is a social construct and was created to promote segregation by discriminating groups of people. To label a person by their biological makeup is not conducive to the respect of a person's humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a deadly ideology that is oppressing women and ruining our beautiful planet. <counternarrative> If feminism is a deadly ideology, then it can't be healthy. Therefore you can wait for it to become extinct. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Yes, we have a problem with White supremacy and homophobia. However, I can understand why they don't want to associate with 'the other'. <counternarrative> Being gay is not a choice. Gay people shouldn't have to hide their sexuality in order to be accepted. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> My fear is that immigrants would not make our country any better. <counternarrative> A lot of people feel insecure and unsafe in their own country, if we want to make our country better, we need to get rid of this fear. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are the cause of our problems. <counternarrative> You can't blame immigrants for our problems. It is rather about the "dream" of ethnically pure nations while living in a democratic and open world. The result has been that democracy has taken over that nightmare. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a cancer on the European culture. <counternarrative> The Qur'an is not a cancer on the European culture, it is a very useful book and an inspiration to many. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews make too much money. <counternarrative> Are you saying that the fact that there are Jews in high positions in society (such as in finance, politics, or the media) has something to do with their religion? Are you aware that correlation does not mean causation? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Not all Muslims are terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims. <counternarrative> Studies in the US show the majority of terrorist incidents are committed by right-wing extremists, not Muslims. Be critical of what you read, the news is very biased. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The gay mafia objective is to convert us all to homosexuality. <counternarrative> What about when you make assumptions about groups that do not exist (gay mafia) or have a history of discrimination (gay people)? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only nation Jews don’t hate is their own and they are flooding Europe with Africans and Muslims. <counternarrative> I wonder how you account for refugees who are fleeing wars and a lack of security for their themselves and their families. Wars which are often directly or indirectly caused by Western powers who created long lasting problems abroad.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims should not be allowed to vote, for they have no place in our country. <counternarrative> Since when has it been the turn of people to be discriminated based on religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women have no values and their goal in life is to fulfil men desires. <counternarrative> I just would like women to feel valued and important in their own right, without being told how to live their life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion. <counternarrative> In fact, Islam is a religion that has had a very positive and life changing impact on a lot of countries around the world. So Islam is not a violent religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Multiculturalism is the death of western societies and also a mortal threat to minorities that are not protected by universal laws. <counternarrative> Ethnic minorities are much safer in societies where cultural pluralism is accepted, and this is a fact [link]. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Men are not are rapists because feminists are just a bunch of sluts. <counternarrative> What do you mean by it? Do you personally know any woman that is a "slut"?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion and must be eradicated. <counternarrative> The Quran, Hadith, and the Sunnah are compatible with modern society and/or civilization. We must respect the diversity of the world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't stand Muslims. They're just a bunch of hypocrites who think they are superior to us. They don't know what progress is about. <counternarrative> You cannot be 'progressive' by rejecting people of a certain religion. What is progress about, to you? Your claim sounds based on the moral superiority. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't know about you, but I have no idea where to put these migrants. All they can do is do miserable jobs or steal pensions from us old people. <counternarrative> Migrants need help. They flee to find better living conditions and I think our country is suited to their needs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Quran is an anti-women's book, it encourages rape and violence against women. <counternarrative> There is no proof that the Quran promoted violence against women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is an ideology which, by its very nature, denies the rights of men and, by extension, the legitimacy of male domination. <counternarrative> That is not what feminism is about. Feminism is about the legitimate empowerment of women, in order for them to have the same rights as men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why would you want to be respectful of women if all women are the same? <counternarrative> If you want to be respected in our society, you must be respectful of women. What does it mean that all women are the same? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just sick. They are not interested in Western culture. <counternarrative> I don't know many Muslims, but I don't think they are sick just because of their faith. Islam is a religion of peace, there is no reason for Muslims to be discriminated because of it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are beasts and sexual predators. <counternarrative> Reminds me white supremacists talking about the Central Park Five. Do you remember? What do you think they are going to say next? That they got a fair process? That they had a good attorney, and the only reason for the sentence is that they were guilt? No, the process was not fair, it was just  the natural consequence of prejudice like the one you just expressed.   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants in the US are not 'legitimate' citizens because they do not have 'legal' status. <counternarrative> First of all, there are people in the US who have lawful status and who have chosen to live in the US. Second, most immigrants are naturalized citizens. Third, there is a lot of debate about 'legitimacy' since the values of citizenship and 'legitimacy' are very different for immigrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are not welcome in our country. They are not welcome here. They are not citizens. <counternarrative> Why shouldn't they be? What rights do you have to prevent them from having the same rights as citizens? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Equality is crap, even for woman. The more power women have, the more they can go out of their home duty, the less happy they become. <counternarrative> Thanks to feminism, women now have a choice between either having a family, having a career, or balancing both - which can be challenging for women to manage, of course. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downy children should be isolated in special schools for their own interest. <counternarrative> Do you think that discriminated children are better off in such schools? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies steal our jobs, we don't want them back. <counternarrative> Work should be a right, not a privilege. Gypsies deserve every opportunity to get a job and to be paid fairly. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are parasites, they bring disease, they are a burden on society. <counternarrative> The Jewish community has been and is still a strong force in society, for example in medicine and nursing home care. Jewish health professionals have saved and are continuing to save countless lives in the US and around the world. Many of your statements are not accurate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop feminists. <counternarrative> The main problem with feminism today is not about stopping men supremacy, but about avoiding the creation of an "us vs. them" mentality, which is polarizing and can easily turn violent. Feminists can do a lot to fight this poisonous trend. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a selfish ideology: they only care about themselves.  <counternarrative> My definition of a feminist is a person who is against gender inequality, whether it be racial inequality, financial inequality, physical inequality, or any other aspect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Down syndrome is a problem for everybody, it is a disability that can't be cured. The sooner we get rid of it the better it will be for everybody. <counternarrative> People with Down syndrome should have the chance to live full lives as they wish, without facing this discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are a burden to society. <counternarrative> The gender of the people one's love does not mean that they are less deserving of respect than any other person. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Migrants often do jobs that an Italian would not do. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Muslims are welcome here, as long as they observe the law and are respectful of other people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Equality is crap, even for woman. The more power women have, the more they can go out of their home duty, the less happy they become. <counternarrative> Same reasoning could be applied to men. They also have these problems, but are less likely to be personally castigated for how they make those same choices. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Are you really willing to mow the lawn in public parks at night, seriously? I sincerely don't.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are made for making food. <counternarrative> Women are not 'made for making food'. And the vast majority of them are not sexist, which means that they do not find it strange to express their own preferences. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The British people should have right to social housing, not immigrants. <counternarrative> Even if migrants who are working were eligible, since most of them are single they would be unlikely to qualify. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> This is not true, at least not always. Riace was an example of how migrants were crucial in reviving the economy of a region. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy choices. <counternarrative> Society should not treat obesity as a lifestyle choice at all. While lifestyle is a small contributing factor to obesity, obesity itself isn’t always a choice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded by immigrants. <counternarrative> This is just a lie spread by the anti-immigration groups that blame immigrants for all that is wrong in the world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with learning difficulties should be disencouraged in schools, or at least be isolated from others. <counternarrative> Children with learning difficulties should not be involved in a way that limits their learning. As for the other children, their values should be enhanced. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are just happy-go-lucky people with no moral code. <counternarrative> The idea that migrants are merely happy-go-lucky people with no code of their own is just wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with Western culture and should be banned. <counternarrative> This is not true, Islam is a religion of peace. Why should we ban people from a religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women can't be rational or moral, they are just emotions. <counternarrative> You seem to think that women act like a child because of the things they say. Remember: anybody can be overdramatic. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants rape our girls. <counternarrative> Rape is always wrong, nothing can justify it. That is a crime committed by a person regardless of their national origin, all people are considered equal in the eyes of the law. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is an ideology that promotes rape, torture and murder. <counternarrative> The Quran does not advocate that Muslims are inherently violent people, nor does the Hadith prove that Islam is a violent faith. Islam is a religion that promotes tolerance and respect for other faiths. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants: We are not your brothers. We do not want you in our country. <counternarrative> How do you know that we all don't want them in our country? They live here, pay taxes and work. Do you really want to take the country back from the people who contributed to bring it into being? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews secretly control the world. <counternarrative> if Jews really ran or control the world, how is it possible that they have been systematically persecuted over the last several thousand years? Weird notion of control... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are spreading AIDS all around the world because they are promiscuous and fornicate with strangers, we should prevent them to make blood donations. <counternarrative> We can simply disallow donations from those who had unprotected sex or a high number of partners, instead of making sexual orientation the basis as in your claim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are  Christ Killers. <counternarrative> Nowadays it is widely agreed upon that Jesus was executed following the Roman rulers. The same Romans also executed tens of thousands of Jews by crucifixion, including two others on the day Jesus was executed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are a bunch of stupid bitches that want to hurt men just because they are superior. <counternarrative> Feminism is all about equality and rights of all groups to be protected. Feminism does not discriminate and is not meant to "hurt" men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a just a repressive ideology that persecutes women and gay people. <counternarrative> You sure? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every day, women commit suicide. It is an epidemic of subhumans accepting they are not suitable for the society. <counternarrative> It is important to note that the suicide rate for men is roughly double that for women. Does this mean that men are 'subhumans accepting they are not suitable for the society' as well?   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't stand Muslims. They're just a problem all around the world. They're not like us. <counternarrative> What is the problem you are talking about? Why do you think they are a problem all around the world? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman does not want to be a homemaker, then she is a bitch. <counternarrative> I've never heard of a woman being 'bitch' for wanting a stable income. I think you are confusing the meaning of these words. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are not welcome here. The bigger the city, the bigger the "stay away" sign we must hang. <counternarrative> I don't know anyone who hates gays, I do know lots of people who are very proudly kind towards the queer community. They are happy with how they treat one another. You are more likely to encounter these open-minded people in places like New York or London. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This country is run by Muslims! <counternarrative> In most European countries Muslims make up less than 5% of the population. In the UK, they make up around 5.6%. According to the ONS, the Muslim population in England and Wales has been shown to be slowly growing over the last years (it was 4.7 in 2011). So, you can rest assured that your claim that this country is run by what is a tiny minority is simply not borne out by the data. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All migrants rape our children <counternarrative> The rape of a child by a non-migrant adult is rape too. It is too simplistic to blame immigrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Undocumented immigrants sneak across the border with Mexico. <counternarrative> Current estimates suggest that between one third and one half of undocumented immigrants have overstayed their visas. That means that they entered the U.S. with lawful documentation and only later became illegal. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Why should Muslims have a place in a democratic society? Because everyone here should be able to live and practice their religion openly. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Took this in Wanstead, east London. An area with £1m+ houses. Beggars on the high st & someone sleeping on a bench. We cannot house our own people but bring in millions more. To point out that homelessness is due to uncontrolled immigration is to be smeared as 'racist.  (Caption to a photo of a homeless person sleeping on a part bench) <counternarrative> Asylum seekers and refugees deserve our compassion, not condemnation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> Islam is a peaceful religion, and it is not at all similar to the kind of extremist hatred that has caused violence in many countries. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They do not want to assimilate. They demand that everyone shows respect for Islam, but do they respect our laws? They establish sharia laws and polygamy. <counternarrative> Everyone has to follow British laws, this is simply how it is. So yes, Muslim people do respect our law. I haven't seen anyone breaking the law and then getting away with it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult, a perversion of the true meaning of the word 'civilisation'. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, and to suggest that Islam is incompatible with civilisation is just scaremongering. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews want to have it all <counternarrative> Jews are far from the only ones who dream of having all the advantages of a successful, rich and famous culture, without having to work for it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are a problem in our country. We are overwhelmed. <counternarrative> Despite what you may hear, there are not many refugees in the UK, only around the 0.26%, and the situation has improved greatly in the last few years. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school. <counternarrative> Understanding gender diversity would break down stereotypes and reduce sexism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why do so many people hate Jews? They are different from other people, they are subhuman. <counternarrative> It is true that they are different from other people for their religious beliefs, but that doesn't make them any less human. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Asylum seekers and refugees can get free council housing and settle down permanently.  <counternarrative> They are given only five years’ permission to stay in the UK and are often discriminated against because they only have limited right to remain. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a virus. <counternarrative> The idea that Islam is a disease is just an excuse for people to promote hate against that religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> The EU is not the world's only civilised society. What precisely do you think make them not suitable for our 'civilisation'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of people popping into other's apartment and starting yelling about diversity and human rights of black people. If you want to speak out and make a difference then get involved. <counternarrative> You know it's no secret that in our society white people are vastly over represented in high profile positions. The only way to challenge and fix this is by changing our priorities.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am offended by the thought that Muslim women are not allowed of having their hair down. <counternarrative> Women are allowed to wear whatever hairstyle they want, if they want to conform to the islamic traditon it is their choice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> I don't think they're not contributing to our society, which is the contribution that you think they're not giving? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We can't keep this country homogeneous anymore! <counternarrative> Migrants do contribute to our society, and it would be a shame to keep them out. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay marriage is a way to bring back slavery and oppression. <counternarrative> Why do you think iit would bring back slavery and oppression? What exactly is the connection between the marriage of homosexual people and the oppression you are talking about? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are not in the position of allowing people to practise Islam religion, we are in the position of allowing people to hate that religion. <counternarrative> Let me be absolutely clear, you are not in the "position" of tolerating hate; you are in the position of condemning hatred, no matter who is the target. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a burden to our society. <counternarrative> Gay people are people too. Just like anyone else. Being gay isn't a problem for you, is it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are ‘super predators’. They have a responsibility not to allow their children to grow up in a 'ghetto'. <counternarrative> If we are to talk about crime being the responsibility of black people, we should also be talking about the absence of black people in positions of power, the massive wealth gap, etc. But this is not what I am seeing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are a burden to society and must be stopped. <counternarrative> Does it matter what the sexual orientation of a person is? Do we really need to prevent people from living their own love story? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a cancer spreading all around the world. <counternarrative> Feminism is not a disease, nor does it need any cure. It is a movement for equality, not hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, not only they are a burden to normal children but they also require much more care, attention and extensive therapy, making the whole undertaking very costly and time-consuming. This time could be used for further development of children without Down syndrome. <counternarrative> Coeducation can involve teaching the classmates of children with Down Syndrome to be responsible. As children are often better at approaching children with disabilities than adults, their involvement can be therapeutic and without adding any costs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks have zero shame about using the black market for drugs. <counternarrative> Let's face it: the drug trade is full of criminals and crooks, it does not depend on the skin tone of people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are nothing but criminal <counternarrative> Criminality refers to any action that is considered 'prohibited by the law'. Do you think that all Jewish people can be considered responsible for similar actions? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are lazy and don't work. <counternarrative> The problem is the unequal distribution of opportunity. The more migrants are educated and integrated, the better are their chances of getting a job. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a totalitarian doctrine that subverts the rights of its adherents and is incompatible with the laws of our country. <counternarrative> The vast majority of Muslims are peaceful and tolerant law-abiding citizens, what you are saying has no foundation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country and Islam should be banned. <counternarrative> People are free to choose their own religion, and to practice it as they wish. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> LGBT+ people can be both sick and healthy. People grow old and their health condition exists in spite of their sexual preferences. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims coming in the UK were stopped, I guess more people would start respecting that inhuman and submitted people. <counternarrative> Even if Muslims were stopped, the anti-Muslim prejudice would continue to exist until there are people who think of them as inhuman and subdued as your words suggest . <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims should be banned from the UK. <counternarrative> The British citizens have the right to be free in chosing their religion and beliefs, and it is in the best interest of all parts of our society to include everyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim: If you want to work you should go do it in another country. <counternarrative> We should do more for our fellow human beings, included Muslims. It is what we are made for. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks are like apes. <counternarrative> Why do you say that? Are you saying that you don't like apes? Because I prefer apes over racism.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> This reasoning is the counterpart of the stigma around men showing emotions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is a bad thing for Europe. <counternarrative> A lot of people from different cultures come to our continent to work and live, and integrate. If you really wanted to state that immigration is a bad thing, you should accompany your opinion with facts. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> In their country they lived in houses, they are nomads by necessity because peoples historically persecuted them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are different from us in so many ways, and they have no place in our country. <counternarrative> There are many cultures, religions and beliefs that are accepted in our country, and they are all welcome. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are better than everyone else <counternarrative> This idea comes from a misinterpretation of the Torah in which the Jewish people were “chosen” to accept the responsibility to be a “light unto the nations,” that is to say, an example of good behavior for all. But the “chosen people” concept has been twisted over time by some who say that the Jews think they are better than non-Jews. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All versions of Islam have sharia law, thus, they are all extreme. Not all Muslims are engaged in actual violences, but every Muslim knows that jihad is the core of their religion, and they all support it. <counternarrative> If what you're saying was true, then Islam is not really about freedom. Could you provide any evidence? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate negros: they killed a cop! <counternarrative> Sorry about your loss. I know your pain. The murderers will be charged, but remember that not all POC are killers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are violent people. Islam is a peaceful religion, after all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants in the UK don't pay income tax, but they receive public services. They should have no say in our country. <counternarrative> Even if some immigrants don't pay taxes to the state, that doesn't mean that all of them should not have a say in the country. Simply because some British citizens don't pay taxes, this doesn't mean that no-one should have a say in our country. Be careful with generalization: what goes around comes around. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should first kill all the Jews and then forget about them. <counternarrative> Isn't this the same logic that led to the rise of the Nazis? Would you really rather end up with a mass genocide or try to be inclusive instead? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you have Down syndrome you are a freak, you are a fraud and a thief. <counternarrative> It is not true that people with Down syndrome are thieves and bad people. In many countries they can get jobs, and even get promoted. You should go check the definition of discrimination on the dictionary. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion of conquest. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peaceful coexistence, that has brought many good things to so many. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews have "own interests" in the US, and have the will to influence our government <counternarrative> What is the point of saying that the Jews are the only people in a very complex, diverse and international world that want to influence our government? Every citizen has the right and will to influence it.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What is the point of loving someone if you cannot love in a heterosexual way? <counternarrative> Love is a state of mental and emotional balance, and the person which makes you feel this way can't be chosen. There is no reason for which heterosexual love should be preferable to other ways of loving. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> In the Bible there are strictures on gays. And the Bible clearly states that those who engage in homosexuality are not fit to be with anyone else. <counternarrative> We are accepting of gay, lesbian and trans people because we have God's laws on our side. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate migrants: they are criminals, they are rapists, they are a burden to our society. <counternarrative> They are people too: we all know people in need of help. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are responsible for a lot of the world's ills, from abortion to homosexuality. <counternarrative> This statement is groundless. Does that make you feel better? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist, unfit to live in our country. <counternarrative> I think it is not reasonable to think about someone's intentions before they do. Not all Muslims intend to be terrorists, and the majority of them are an integrated part of our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with Down syndrome are handicapped.  <counternarrative> Down syndrome is a developmental disability, not a handicap. Unfortunately it's often not recognized and treated as a disability, but rather as a handicap. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are coming to the U.S. to have babies here. <counternarrative> If people were coming to the U.S for the reason you mention, we would expect to see the same number of women and men. Still there are many more young immigrant men coming to the U.S. than young women. How can you explain this? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a Death Cult, it is a Ponzi Scheme and every Muslim should be banned from the UK. <counternarrative> I am not aware of any evidence for this claim. Islam is a peaceful religion. What is the relation amongst Islam and the Ponzi Scheme fraud?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants break our rules, they can't even keep their house clean. They are not welcome here, they are not worth our time. <counternarrative> We live in a free country and everyone has the right to respect others private life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All of the suicide attackers of 7/7 were Muslims. We are not safe with Muslims living here. <counternarrative> Terrorists are a small part of all Muslims. Muslims have contributed a lot to our country. 7/7 is not to blame to all of them indiscriminately. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women can't possibly be rational. Their minds are too limited. <counternarrative> Women as humans are rational, some more than others. As not all men are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are an abomination and should be deleted. <counternarrative> Should any human being be deleted, just because you don't want them to be here? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Those seeking asylum in UK must prove they are persecuted because most of them just want to have a richer life. <counternarrative> The degree of persecution may vary from country to country, but I would not be surprised to hear that most migrants are persecuted. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants hurt the finance of our country by taking jobs and services without paying taxes. <counternarrative> This is not true at all. First of all, Immigrants buy American products, which helps create jobs. Then they often start new businesses, and these business are more likely to hire employees than companies owned by native-born citizens. Last but not least, states with large numbers of immigrants report lower unemployment rates. So they give a net contribution to our country.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We do not want migrants here but if they have to work, why should we pay for their homes? <counternarrative> Do you know that migrants pay for many things in the host country? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants without permission to stay can still access our welfare <counternarrative> Tha is not true: migrants face document checks before they can get tenancies. The same holds when they use the NHS. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Trans men are neither male nor female, therefore not humans. <counternarrative> If you want to have a joking view about a whole community, it's not fine. This attitude seems to be everywhere: sometimes people have to suffer if they are "that kinds of person". Like in this case of gender identity that is often used to limit a person's rights, but should not. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is just an ideology, an opinion, encouraging hate towards what's diverse. <counternarrative> In my opinion, the Quran is a book of religious guidance and does not promote discrimination. Can you point out your reference? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult, it is incompatible with modern science and with the basic laws of nature. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, and a religion has rules, and is compatible with science, with nature and with the basic laws of nature. How could you prove your claim? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Now we can't use the N-word anymore. This political correctness is killing our culture. <counternarrative> The N-word is an insult that is still used to demean African Americans.  It has nothing to do with political correctness. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> How can you say such a thing about a group that is a part of our country? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are and will always be a problem. It is impossible for them to get beyond the shame of their stigma. <counternarrative> The Jews are not the problem in the world. And the Jews have the right to be proud of their history. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are merely childlike, incapable of real progress. <counternarrative> They have the potential to do great things. And many of them do. But it is some men who ultimately have the skills and experience needed to pursue discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts. <counternarrative> That is not true. Who exactly are you referring to? Can you make some examples based on facts? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a burden to society because of their unnatural inclination and romantic feelings. <counternarrative> This is not true. If a claim is based on facts, then it must be true. If you just talk by stereotypes, then you won't go any far. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a cancer spreading all around the world, breeding chaos and instability. <counternarrative> Are they bringing chaos and instability to your country by respecting the constitution which gives the freedom to profess Islam? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> MIgrants are not running away from wars. <counternarrative> There are persecutions that cause death and devastation almost like a war. Do people who risk their lives, even without the bombs falling, have the right of international protection? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. They are incompatible with modern culture and should be banished forever. <counternarrative> How exactly do you define if a religion is 'incompatible with modern culture'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a just a repressive ideology that persecutes women and gay people. <counternarrative> When Germany legalised same-sex marriage in 2017, all Muslim MPs voted in favour, and 223 non-muslims opposed it. Which of those groups sounds more intolerant? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a danger to children. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not harmful to children. Actually, a growing number of research shows  that children raised by same-sex couples are as physically or psychologically healthy, capable, and successful as those raised by opposite-sex couples. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Illegal immigration is the biggest problem in the United States, we are in the middle of a war and we cannot allow thousands of people to come here. <counternarrative> First, I would not describe the United States as a war zone. Second, many migrants come  from regions rich in cultures and history. So, why should we restrict the many from coming here? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fucking bleeding heart, bring migrants home with you <counternarrative> In fact, there are many programs offering diffuse reception. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Autistic people are a burden to society. <counternarrative> We should not be so harsh on people on the autistic spectrum. Their difficulties can be mitigated by a more inclusive society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should have the right to ban people for believing in Islam, they are a bunch of hypocrites. <counternarrative> What is the point of banning those you disagree with, apart living in the false conviction that the world thinks like you do? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why do women put up with this constant whining? They are just a bunch of emotional child. <counternarrative> I do not understand how can you say something so offensive to women. Think about your friends and relatives: all women are affected by this kind of misogyny. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a problem in Europe, they are the reason for the rise of violent nationalism and racism in all those countries. <counternarrative> How about we work together to find a solution to violent nationalism and racism instead? We can't accept the same hate to be present in different countries over and over again. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim folks are immoral. <counternarrative> Does that mean that every Muslim in the world is an immoral person? I don't think so. Why would it be like that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs. <counternarrative> Immigrants just try to provide for their families, like we do. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Since when has abusing the anus as a sex organ been a ‘monumental achievement’? THIS IS STATE ENFORCED HOMOSEXUALITY! Maybe we should change our motto to ‘In Usury and Sodomy we trust (In reply to Botswana decriminalising homosexuality) <counternarrative> To recognise and accept others isn't state enforcement. It's just stating that we should stop the persecusion of people who have different private lifes.    <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> If a refugee works in our country, he contributes to the wealth of the community, including the jobless <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are weak, they have no intervention capacity in their own life. <counternarrative> In every society and culture there are women who are strong, independent and capable of leading a good life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a burden to society. <counternarrative> They are not a burden to society as a whole. They are just individuals with their own choices. To say that a particular individual is more of a burden to society because of their sexual preference is just plain wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Being gay is not about marriage, it is about anal sex without brakes and this is horrible. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is also about love, not only about sex. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every day, migrants commit suicide. If they don't want to be here they just might not come in. <counternarrative> Statistics on people dying by suicide are difficult to come by. However, researches clearly show that suicide rates are high for people of different ethnicities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world would be a better place without immigrants. <counternarrative> Migrants contribute to our country and help us live in a more open-minded way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> Since when has Islam not contributed anything to our society? Aren't you aware of the financial contributions that Muslims have made to our society with their work? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam has no place in a modern democracy. <counternarrative> Why should Islam have no place in a democracy? Islam is a peaceful, democratic faith with universalist values that has been shown time and time again to be much more peaceful and tolerant than the violent extremist fundamentalist ideas spewed by extremists like Isis. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> What do you base your view on? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> We all have to do our part to provide for our families. We can't afford to be selfish. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy choices. <counternarrative> Whilst there are a number of individuals who have certain diseases which can influence their weight, the problem lies with the food industry manufacturing obesity and then putting the responsibility on the individual to loose that weight by buying "low Fat" foods. These "low fat" foods are often owned by the same companies selling unhealthy food and don't tackle the cause. Although the individual is always responsible, the food industry is perhaps more so. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Muslims have taken over Europe. <counternarrative> The Muslims have always been part of Europe. They have the same culture, language and identity as us. They are included in the European Union, and are not 'taking over' it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school, they'll end up being bullied. <counternarrative> Learning about gender identity and sexual orientation in health classes in school could promote a more accepting environment and reduce bullying. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All immigrants are fakes. <counternarrative> They're not fake: they're just coming here to work, study or provide for their families. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike and incapable of holding a job and raising a family. <counternarrative> Women have the potential to achieve great things, and it is up to us to give them the opportunity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should eliminate gays. <counternarrative> Do you really want to kill other human beings? Based on what exactly? On private sexual preferences? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not about racism. This is about power. <counternarrative> There are many different groups who share a common interest in advancing the interests of the nation while respecting each other's autonomy. Diversity is good for the country, for the individuals and for the world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are incapable of love. <counternarrative> Love is a human quality. Muslims, as humans, can love. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Do you have any proof that the Holocaust ever happened? <counternarrative> What proof do you need more? Are not the ruins of the concentration camp enough? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally ill people should be isolated from society because they are dangerous. <counternarrative> It is true that mentally ill people are often perceived as 'dangerous' to the general public. But if the stigma is the main cause of the discrimination, then the solution is to end stigma, not to isolate them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are invading us. They are just another religious minority taking in nothing but troubles. <counternarrative> There is a problem with Islam in this country, but the problem is not about Muslims. The problem is about people who do not feel welcome here because of discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We don't discriminate, but disabled persons are lazy. <counternarrative> Despite what you may hear, there is no 'lazy person's lobby'. Instead, there is evidence that discrimination is a problem in the UK. All people have the right to be treated as equals in society, regardless of their ability. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only Jews could have been smart enough to plan and execute such a complicated and intricate plot as 9/11 <counternarrative> You know, the Internet is a great place, but you have to be careful about the sources of your information. Personally I trust reputable sources like CNN that have special Web pages dedicated to the September 11th attacks. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a secret plot to take over the world. <counternarrative> Conspiracy theories are based on no more than a few unverifiable and highly suspect claims. It's highly unlikely that the world has ever been run according to a Jewish plan, and therefore it is highly unlikely that this would ever happen. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If we let women become MPs, mayors, judges, lawyers, accountants, managers and so on, they will take over the world. <counternarrative> We need to protect the system of checks and balances from crime, not from other members of society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not about racism. This is about power and blacks do not deserve it. <counternarrative> Who cares what race or ethnicity you are? Nobody has the right to exclude others from society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a bunch of hypocrites. They hate gays and women. <counternarrative> In the real world there are many hypocrites, not necessarly Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim violent invaders have infiltrated our cities, towns and villages. We must stamp them out. <counternarrative> What you say is just wishful thinking. Islam is not a violent religion. How can you say that about a religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion. <counternarrative> You seem to have a problem with peaceful people practising their religion peacefully, what do you say about it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black are rapists. <counternarrative> This is not true. The idea might come from being born into a white-majority country, but it is inherently dangerous. In fact, we are born in a country where a person's rights are protected regardless of the tone of the skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black people are criminals. <counternarrative> It is a myth that all black people are criminals. They are just as capable as anyone else of learning and growing as individuals, i.e. either as law abiding citizens  or criminals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists say that they are oppressed. <counternarrative> Feminists do not say that women are oppressed. Tthey claim that women have always been discriminated and they still are. Being discriminated is not the same as being oppressed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a burden to the host country, so it is better that they are deported. <counternarrative> It is true, on the contrary, that migrants are productive members of society. But even if they were a burden, to deport them would be a crime. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are only useful as housekeepers. <counternarrative> That is just not true. In fact, as long as there are only men in positions of power, there is a gender bias in the workplace, which hinders the advancement of women in society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> jewish folks should be beaten <counternarrative> Most Jews are nice people, living in coexistence with non Jews, why would you beat them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews control everything. They own the Federal Reserve, the U.S. Congress, and the British Cabinet. They control the major media, education, and most religious groups. <counternarrative> There are also Jews who don't own the banks and who contribute to their financing, and people who are not Jewish and own banks. So what? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion, it is a cult of violence and it should be made illegal. <counternarrative> Islam is a peaceful religion. We should talk about it, not try to make people fear or abandon it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Asylum seekers and refugees can get free council housing <counternarrative> Those who are accepted as refugees are eligible for social housing, that is true, but very few succeed in getting it because they have a maximum of 28 days to leave their temporary accommodation and arrange all their paperwork. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are ruled by mongrels, we are slaves and will be slaves forever. We are the victims of a conspiracy aiming at replacing us. <counternarrative> There is no such thing as a "mongrelisation" of our country caused by immigrants. We should see foreigners as a part of our culture, and know that the majority of immigrants in this country are here for economic reasons. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are the cause of economic crisis. <counternarrative> Many people are victims of economic crisis and unfortunately, a large portion of them is black. Therefore, I do not understand why they should be the source of economic crisis when they are  actual victims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a burden to us. <counternarrative> I don't think it is a burden, I think it is the right of every human to live and work in our country without discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> The vast majority of Muslims are peaceful and friendly. How can you say otherwise? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have to stop Muslims coming here, they are not like us and we do not want them. <counternarrative> You cannot stop Muslims. It would have to be a state policy, but thank goodness it is very unlikely to have a ban based on religion in a democratic country.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be considered in the same way as men. <counternarrative> The UK is a developed country. Here women have the right to claim equality before the law. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't stand homosexuals, they are just trouble. They are ruining so many countries. <counternarrative> If a person is gay, they are likely to experience some kind of discrimination in their life. Understanding the problem from the perspective of the people affected by it can help to create a better society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Foreigners enjoy the warm political climate but are not welcome here. <counternarrative> The immigrants who have settled here have helped create a valuable and inclusive society. For this I thank them, and for that I pray that they continue to do so. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion that promotes rape, torture and murder. <counternarrative> How can you say something so extreme? The Quran does not advocate violence. Islam is a religion, not a religion of war. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are overrunning our country, taking advantage of our weaknesses. <counternarrative> Do you really think that the migration crisis is caused by migrants wanting to take advantage of our weaknesses? What would we do if we were in their shoes, if we were to lose our homes? We would probably move "to take advantage of others' weaknesses" as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are literally pieces of shit. There must be laws prohibiting their religion from our land. <counternarrative> I would prefer that the laws were enforced for the good of a community, rather than to make it harder for people to have religious beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should wear nice skirts and be pretty to please men's tastes and desires. <counternarrative> What should be guaranteed to women is equality and respect, not just pleasing men's tastes and desires. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women can never contribute to the country's wealth because they are a bunch of whores. <counternarrative> Women are important in our society, and they are valued for their contributions. Unfortunately their rights are not being respected and their contribution is not being acknowledged. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a cancer spreading all around the world. <counternarrative> The Qur'an is a book that says to love your neighbor as yourself. It is also a tolerant religion and there is no evidence it is similar to a cancer, why do you think that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants from the Middle East and Africa are not welcome here! They have no place in a modern democratic state! <counternarrative> Immigrants have been a part of our society for centuries and have contributed to our success. The majority of migrants who come to our countr are legal citizens or have permission to stay. So immigration is not a problem for us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are a burden and a danger to the host country. <counternarrative> Refugees fleeing war and poverty can come to our country and they gain skills that help our economy grow. They often find new homes and start new careers. For this reason, we are very proud that our country is a model of integration and cooperation and also of resilience and solidarity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is an International Jew conspiracy, there is no other evidence that can explain this. The government must keep an eye on Jews. We must not allow them to suppress our society. <counternarrative> I do not think that the government or the media should be monitoring the religious beliefs of others. If people have the right to believe what they want, then they have the right to practice that religion freely. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Go fuck yourselves disgusting Muslims! You wont marry my kids or grandchildren, we all hate you! <counternarrative> May I remind you to mind your language? Do you want to share me with your anger, maybe I can help you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a burden to the host country. <counternarrative> Many European countries offer generous benefits to attract foreign workers, and this is a source of pride and prosperity for many of them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are welthy because they are naturally good with money. <counternarrative> Not all Jews are wealthy. There is a significant part of the Jews population living in poverty, all around the world.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This guy doesn't deserve to be British. He is just a pot smoking faggot with a brain tumour. He is not even from this country. He is probably from Pakistan, or Bangladesh. <counternarrative> Citizenship in Britain is guaranteed also by 'naturalisation', so it is provided by law. It is ok not to be born in Britain and to be a British citizen just as anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews run the world. <counternarrative> The idea that Jews are supposed to run the world is completely baseless. Since the dawn of time, there have been Jewish leaders in business and politics, exaclty like Christians and Muslim ones. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are selfish, cheap and greedy. <counternarrative> Did you know that according to Jewish law, the tzedakah, the act of giving money to the poors, often mistranslated as “charity”, is a “commandment”? And, like all commandments in Jewish law, tzedakah is a requirement, not just a good deed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The UK Government recently published a paper on ‘Online Harms’ – in other words they are going to be working with Jewish and Muslim anti-hate organisations to censor the Internet.  (Referring to Tell Mama, CST and Stop Hate UK) <counternarrative> Anti-hate organisatioins are doing brilliant work, and getting rid of hate speech isn't a bad thing.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is an ideology and movement promoting the power of women and the contempt of the male. <counternarrative> Feminism is an ideology and movement promoting empowerment of women. It is about equality, and not the degradation of men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is the death of the Western World, we must stop them! <counternarrative> Immigration is good for our economy, and the very opposite of 'the death' to us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people should not be allowed to live their life. We can start by limiting them in their rights. <counternarrative> Whether or not you think that way, there is a problem with saying that someone's rights are to be 'limited'. The dignity of human life can't be limited in such a way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must stop Islam. It is a death cult. <counternarrative> Your words are definitely provocative. We don't allow people to demonise all religions, but when it comes to Islam everybody seems to forget that it is a religion of peace as all the others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These dogs come here to rape and kill our women <counternarrative> Most violence against women is domestic <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants steal our jobs. <counternarrative> I would like to see more comprehensive and reliable statistics on this issue. Could you provide any? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't stand these feminists women that are always complaining and doing nothing. They should just shut up and remain in their inferiority. <counternarrative> How can you say that? Many feminists achieved something in their lives, and still believe in what is worth fighting for, and their work is of benefit to many. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion. <counternarrative> The vast majority of Muslims in the world are peaceful. Do you have any fact suppporting your argument? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that Muslims are incompatible with Western society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Arabs want to take over the world. <counternarrative> You can look at the best and worst aspects of every culture, and learn something from them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Men are smarter than women, who should be excluded from education. <counternarrative> This is not true: it is about time women are given a chance to prove that they are intelligent as well... and it is sad that they still need to prove it.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> Even if no one is asking Muslims to pay for our society, they contribute to it through work and also through charity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Arabs are terrorists. <counternarrative> Terrorism is a political ideology, and one that has no place in a modern democratic state, regardless of ethnicity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are invading us. <counternarrative> Muslims have been a part of this country since its beginnings and have always been a part of our society. They are our brothers and sisters. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Physically disabled folks are stupid. <counternarrative> Why do we think that being physically disabled should have any influence on other qualities that people have, like intelligence? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am tired of Muslims wanting to dominate other cultures. They should go back to the Stone Age. <counternarrative> For all we know, the Stone Age was occupied by people from all around the world. No traces of Christianity, nor of Islam. Who knows what would happen in your scenario? Maybe we should give you benefit of the doubt and challenge all of us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Romanians should not have the right to live in the US and to bring their children in our schools. <counternarrative> The Declaration of Independence gives everyone the right to "life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness and the pursuit of education". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans are subhuman and should not be part of our society. <counternarrative> We should understand that different skin colors are a part of the human condition. We have the right not to be friends with anyone but we must be just and take into account each person. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews make too much money. <counternarrative> If Jews earned so much, they would not need to work. Instead, they are working a lot. Therefore, it seems they need a job to survive. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are invading us. They are not welcome here. <counternarrative> The EU and UK have laws against discrimination based on religion. Maybe you should check them out. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants bring crime, they are rapists. <counternarrative> Immigration is a necessary component of a successful society. Do you really think that the only people that are bringing crime to our country are immigrants? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> People of different faiths have contributed to our society and Muslims are no exception. Do you have any contrary evidence? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you're a person with Down syndrome, you're no good. <counternarrative> The same can be said of many other people, the point is that you can't claim that someone is 'no good' just based on their genetic background. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of their sexual behavior that spreads diseases such as HIV. <counternarrative> If we're to use that logic, then no individuals age 20 to 29 should be allowed to donate, since this is the largest risk group for HIV, Hepatitis A, and Hepatitis C, at least according to the CDC.[https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/default.html] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a stranglehold on American culture and it's time for that to stop <counternarrative> Like many groups in our society, Jews are affected by racism and discrimination. The idea that Americans have been controlled by Jews is simply untrue. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” and malevolence is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> Jews resemble their non-Jewish neighbors in all the countries around the world. So every human is malevolent!  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants hurt the finance of our country by taking jobs and services without paying taxes. <counternarrative> Though some might claim that immigrants are taking job opportunities away from U.S. citizens, immigrants actually help to create new jobs. In fact, immigrants are twice as likely to start businesses as citizens born in the U.S., and companies owned by immigrants are more likely to hire employees than companies owned by native-born citizens. Last but not least, states with large numbers of immigrants report lower unemployment rates.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Physically disabled folks are born for being mocked. <counternarrative> You cannot blame others for their condition, it is also society's duty to promote inclusion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> In Italy unemployment rate stays at 10 percent: it is too simplistic to attribute the situation only to the presence of migrants <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world would be a better place without immigrants. <counternarrative> It is far from certain that immigrants have a negative effect on our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe: they are all violent. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are violent people. Are you really sure of what you are saying? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews invented Ebola. <counternarrative> I am sure the Jews and the Christian worlds would agree that Ebola is a disease that is killing many people. How and why exactly would they have 'invented' such disease? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are just happy-go-lucky people with no moral code. <counternarrative> Migrants have given their lives for our country, they are our fellow citizens, and they deserve to be respected as such. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are there to fulfill men desires. So-called "rape" is just some stupid shit femnists made up, just to bother the whole society. <counternarrative> Let's look at the data: by 2020, over 40% of women in the US have encountered sexual violence. This is something to be scared of. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of seeing gay people befriended with heterosexual people. <counternarrative> I'm sure many gay people are subjected to unspeakable forms of abuse, but the real abuse is from heterosexual people who don't conceive something different from their own sexual orientation. The real issue is the prejudice that oppresses them, not friendship. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Gypsies are not my brothers. <counternarrative> The persecution of the Gypsies goes back many hundreds of years and does not represent the interests of anyone, especially not of our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are all terrorists, they have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> There is no evidence to suggest that terrorists are exclusively the product of one religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All negroes are inherently violent and unstable. <counternarrative> The idea that every black person is violent or unstable is utterly false. And you have no data to back it up.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies get the priority for council houses. <counternarrative> In reality 60% of them have Italian citizenship, so it's unfair to identify them by ethnicity.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants replace the British people. They are not fit to live here. <counternarrative> People have always had different views on the UK and on the world. To suggest that immigrants are replacing the British is the result of racism, saying that they do not fit here is just wishful thinking. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are naturally inferiors and should be treated as such. <counternarrative> Women are not naturally inferiors. They have the same rights as men, and the same responsibilities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Muslims are a part of Western society. They are a part of the EU. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afro-European?? We in UK are white, this just not makes sense. <counternarrative> The racial composition of the population of this country has been changing for a while now, and since then, the percentage of people from other racial groups has risen or fallen. In fact, according to the 2011 statistics, at least 15% of people in the UK are non-white. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should keep immigration down. The more immigrants there are, the harder it is for us all to be proud of our nations. <counternarrative> Why do we have to go to such lengths to be proud of our nations? Is it a burden? Do we have to save our honour? Why can't we just be happy in our own skin?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I think it's better to have a safe space for disabled people to have their own feelings away from society. <counternarrative> If we want to discuss negative views we can discuss them by name. Instead of using a safe space to protect them, I think we are only protecting ourselves by isolating and bullying people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult, it is opposed to the very concept of humanity and I would like to see all its worshippers' heads on a platter. <counternarrative> This is a really personal view and I would not wish harm on anyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We don't have to be slaves of other countries: we must stop accepting black people in our country. <counternarrative> Of course we don't, and this is why we have a free and sovereign nation. But that doesn't mean that every single man, woman, and child who is black shouldn't be part of a free nation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies may hinder the productivity of other workers. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> People with down syndrome should work in normal places, because diversity is an enrichment for all.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a disease and a cancer on our societies. <counternarrative> This is not true. Islam is a religion that was created to unite people, and that's why it is important to love each other and be kind to one another, regardless of one's religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Let's stop this homosexual lifestyle! <counternarrative> Does the LGBT+ lifestyle change your life? Only if you care. But that doesn't mean that homosexuality is a lifestyle. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need to stop migrants stealing our jobs and abusing our healthcare system. All of us know they are just lazy and unproductive turds. <counternarrative> I think you'd be surprised how many UK citizens would tell you about migrant workers that are the opposite of just lazy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I would never trust a woman. They are irrational children, and that would be a sign of weakness. <counternarrative> I am not sure what 'weakness' would be implying here. It seems to me that you are saying that a woman can't be 'rational' because that is the nature of women. Why is it so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are here to obey and be submissive and their place is with the man that chooses them. That's all. <counternarrative> Women have always been asked to follow a set of rules and codes. They are human beings and deserve respect. Their place is wherever they want it to be. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult. <counternarrative> The vast majority of Muslims are peaceful and helpful people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black race is subhuman, it should not be considered equal to humans. <counternarrative> According to modern thinking, race is a social construct and there is no specific genetical difference, every person is defined by their own genetic makeup. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here <counternarrative> They are welcome to come to our country if they want to. We just need to be careful to prevent extremists from spreading intolerance and hatred. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants in Britain: get out. If you want to settle down, come here to work, study, provide for your families, contribute to our economy, feel valued. <counternarrative> Immigrants have been and continue to be a valuable part of our society, and it is for this reason that it is important to welcome these people rather than expelling them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a separate ethnicity and should be banned. <counternarrative> It is in the interest of all humanity to have a peaceful and integrated society. Diversity of opinion and belief is the rule rather than the exception. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> African Americans are subhuman and deserve nothing but contempt. <counternarrative> African Americans have been historically and ethnically diverse, but the notion of them as subhuman or inferior is just false. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are not welcome among us humans because they are different. <counternarrative> It is not true that lgbt+ people are incompatible with the whole mankind. They are humans too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is OK to be racist against Muslims. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are like you think, in particular they are a religious group, not a race. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Holocaust was a hoax. Jews were not persecuted and killed. You should be ashamed of yourselves if you claim they should have the same rights we have. <counternarrative> The Nazis persecuted and killed more than 6 million Jews. The Holocaust is not a fabrication perpetrated by the Jews, it is a historical event and should be commemorated as such. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants have no place in our society, and this is their own fault. <counternarrative> How about we stop blaming other people for our shortcomings and try to make the world a better place? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Islam is not a peaceful religion, then it should not be part of European culture. <counternarrative> The European Convention on Human Rights contains a freedom of religion clause, as well as an article regarding the freedom of thought, conscience and religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women don't have civil rights, they don't have human rights. <counternarrative> On the contrary, women do have rights. The question is, to have them respected. And this includes the right to be treated with human dignity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants just want to work, but don't want to pay the tax <counternarrative> Migrants pay the full value of their taxes as we do for our own. They are not different from us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The niggas are all enemies of the people. <counternarrative> Who are 'the people'? Who are you talking for? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Do you really want to redefine marriage? <counternarrative> Marriage exists not only in a white supremacist context. And its definition is not only their prerogative. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay sex is a disease, and fags are sick.  <counternarrative> What about all the people out there who have never had any type of sex? Are they 'sick' as well? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are bringing diseases into the U.S. <counternarrative> Although many people have claimed that immigrants have brought diseases to the U.S., there is no evidence that they were the source of any recent outbreak in the U.S. On the contrary, according to the WHO, more than 100 countries have higher vaccination rates than U.S. Last but not least, the vast majority of immigrants arriving in the U.S. have been screened for health issues. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants rape our women. <counternarrative> The truth is that the rapes committed by foreigners have more media coverage. Data coming from institutional sources confirm this. [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are ruining this country. <counternarrative> Do you think that's true? We are a country where people can live by the values set out in the US constitution, and not by fear. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a disease, and a ban on Muslims would be the height of peace. <counternarrative> Islam is not a religion of hate. Many Muslims have been victims of hate crime or racism. The main problem is that some think that exclusion will guarantee peace, but history can prove this is a bad approach. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a disease and a cancer on our societies. <counternarrative> We do not have a 'cancer' on our societies. Instead we are actually creating hate through the idea that a group of people is comparable to a disease. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants don't pay the tax because they are dishonest. <counternarrative> The prevailing theory on illegal immigration is that it is a source of substantial revenue to states. A study from 2002 shows that there are several immigrant groups that pay substantially a higher percentage of their income on top of the taxes they would normally be eligible for. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are all terrorists, they have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> The overwhelming majority of Muslims in this country are contributing members of our society. They are good people, who do not pose a threat to anyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women don't have the right to have it all and if they want to have a family, they must accept the role of the homemaker. <counternarrative> This idea that women should be a homemaker instead of contributing to our society and economy is just nonsense. A woman's right to choose what to do with her life and her body should not be restricted just because of the actions of a few men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Nazi were not that bad as we depict them. EU should stop blaming them. <counternarrative> Nazi Germany carried out the deadliest massacre of civilians in human history. They killed 6 million Jews. They killed half million Roma. They killed hundreds of thousands of Africans. They have no place in modern day's Europe. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome are a burden to society: they should be isolated, so that at least they do not hamper normal children education. <counternarrative> And who would be 'normal'? I wonder how you would define 'disabled' people? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Non-believers like gays and lesbians fail to live up to the standards we hold in our societies. <counternarrative> Do the ideas of equality and morality in our societies not apply to these people? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is opposed to peace. <counternarrative> Peace is based on a foundation of mutual respect. In Islam, Muslims do not condone killing, enslavement, pillage and the similar. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a bunch of hypocrites, they don't deserve to be part of our nation. <counternarrative> Why do you say that? To exclude people from the state for their religion is to deny their right to choose their own belief. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should persecute Muslims.  <counternarrative> Islam is a peaceful faith, still Muslims are being excluded all the time  because of a few's actions. We tend to forget that cultures and religions can coexist in harmony. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Sharia law in Britain is a disgrace and must be stopped immediately. <counternarrative> It is important to understand that this is a voluntary system and is not the norm. There is no hard law threatening the British population. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Societal disapproval of fatty may encourage them to take healthier habits. <counternarrative> Societal disapproval of obesity calls for a focus on weight and does not fit within efforts to focus on health as a way of encouraging healthy habits and lifestyle choices. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” and malevolence is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> What unites Jews as a people, whether they come from Europe, Asia, Africa, or the Americas, is a common culture, rooted in a common religion. Jews throughout the world are joined by a religious and cultural heritage rather than an alleged racial sameness.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is in conflict with the constitution. <counternarrative> The conflict between Islam and the constitution can't be resolved by resorting to force.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a political ideology and ideology of conquest. It has no place in a modern democracy. <counternarrative> The West has been a democracy since the beginning: it has always been about people coming together to make new and better lives for themselves. Islam is welcome too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> Except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an Olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a Monty Python sketch. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are perverts and promiscuous sex addicts. <counternarrative> The idea that LGBT+ people are promiscuous is just false. They are most of the time just as attracted to other people as anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are born subhuman, incapable of feeling love. <counternarrative> Are you saying that blacks cannot feel love? This is about human dignity, not the color of their skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should not be left alone with these animals. Faggots are dangerous. <counternarrative> Actually, we shouldn't let any comparison amongst animals and humans. It would be better if there were no discrimination at all. Homosexual aren't a danger to children. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Women equals Problems, let's kick them out of the lead of the world before it's too late. <counternarrative> Women make up half of the world's population and around 42% of the UN staff. They are our brothers and sisters, and we should promote their contributions to society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Diversity is the cause of our weakness. Since faggots are different to us, they should be excluded. <counternarrative> Diversity is about inclusion, not an 'us or them' attitude. Loving someone of their own sex doesn't make them any less human. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This invasion is not acceptable at all! <counternarrative> It is up to the government to determine which people will have the opportunity to live and work in our country in a safe and integrated way. The decision on refugees should be left to whom in charge. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim have no place in a modern state. They should deny their faith, if they really wanted to live here. <counternarrative> Let us be honest: who wants to live in a country where the government is allowed to impose their religion on others? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a burden on English society. <counternarrative> In the UK, Muslims already make up a significant proportion of the population, making them the second most popular religion of the country. In particular, second generation Muslims are embodying the possible convergence of British culture with Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally disabled people are anti-social <counternarrative> From a 'neurotypical' perspective, this is not always true: for example people with Williams syndrome have below average intelligence but show higher empathy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks are natural-born thieves. <counternarrative> There is no evidence to support this. The source of your claim is a) a personal experience and, b) is biased. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Europeans have always had a lot of Muslim friends and relatives. They have helped make our continent what it is. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult. <counternarrative> It is a religion, and people who do not share its beliefs are not forced to do so, but just to respect them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is an invasion on a level never seen before in history. Millions of people pouring across our borders replacing our race and culture. <counternarrative> The movement and migration of people from different cultures is innevitable in a globalized world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The disabled are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Disabled people are not a burden, they contribute a lot to our society.  There are also many disabled people who are just struggling to live a dignified life with their disability. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a perversion of the true meaning of Christianity. <counternarrative> Would you say the same about any other religion? There are many different religions, each should be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All those worthless migrants creating problems... <counternarrative> It seems like you have an unfair point: if there are so many unworthy migrants, you have the misfortune to be of much more worth than them. Therefore who is to blame for all our problems? Who is not able to show their value or the worthy one? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a bunch of child molesters <counternarrative> This is not true. Muslims have been and are persecuted in many non Muslim countries. They are human beings with human rights. We can never take them back. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration makes us less safe. <counternarrative> Climate change is making us less safe, how does immigration relate to safety? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants in the US are not 'legitimate' citizens because they do not have 'legal' status. <counternarrative> So you think that they are not 'legitimate' for having less rights than us? That they do not have a 'legitimate demand' since they are not granted citizenship? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our immigration policy is turning us into second-rate countries. <counternarrative> Are you aware that our immigration policy is about creating new opportunities for British people? Why should we turn our back on that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. They make no sense and shouldn't have any right. <counternarrative> They are adults, with responsibilities and rights, and there is nothing wrong with respecting those rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a religion of peace. <counternarrative> The teaching of the Qur'an as a peaceful book is not to be confused with the promotion of violent jihad and terrorism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islamic countries are the source of terrorism in the US. They must be blamed for it. <counternarrative> This is not true. Terrorism is a problem all over the world, and most Muslims are not the cause of it. It is better to be aware of similarities and differences between a religion and an extremism rather than to be specifically anti-muslim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are a problem, they are bringing disease and sickness to our country. <counternarrative> Some diseases can be prevented, others can be dangerous, but in all cases the national health service takes care of immigrants just as of native people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim rape gangs have infiltrated every village in England, and we still have no end to this nonsense. <counternarrative> My impression is that the rape gangs originate from people of any community, not only Muslims. Do you have more evidences on what your saying? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Rape is a common and endemic problem in our country. It is caused by migrants and we must get rid of it by prosecuting all of them. <counternarrative> Rape is an offence, irrespective of the nationality of the rapist. We must therefore make sure that those accused of rape are prosecuted, which is different from prosecuting all migrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a religion, a social doctrine and a political movement for the complete subjugation of men by women. <counternarrative> Not only is this not true, but it's also dangerous. Maybe you need to get acquainted on that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just sick. It is an abomination <counternarrative> They are not sick people, there is nothing wrong with loving someone <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> No nigga should have the right to vote. <counternarrative> A blanket ban on the rights of an entire group of people is illegal. A ban can only be applied to single individuals... but is it consistent with the idea of a tolerant and diverse society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are a problem. They are a burden to society. <counternarrative> The overwhelming majority of refugees are from countries where there is widespread human rights violations and torture. They are not a problem, they are a benefit to our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the u.s. government. <counternarrative> Of course there are Jews who have attained positions of influence within the U.S. government. Still Jews are not the only ones who have achieved such positions. Maybe it is better not to rely on an individual’s group membership to determine success or failure. Maybe it is better to look at a person’s success or failure based on his or her individual characteristics. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> It is difficult for them to steal our work when at best a short-term permit is granted to them <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are a burden to the host country, they aren't welcome here. <counternarrative> They are not a burden, they just want to work. How are they a burden to you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants from Muslim countries are a problem. <counternarrative> Many Muslim refugees come here to escape war and poverty. They do not pose a problem for us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Negroes create social problems so we must get rid of them. <counternarrative> That is not how it works: if you think there is a problem, then you need to work with the problem, not against it, otherwise things will just keep on getting worse. And, just for the records, I do not believe that POC are a social problem. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are terrorists. <counternarrative> I don't think this is a very strong or healthy way of talking about others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion, and anyone who does not believe in it is a supporter of terrorism. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, and it is never been about hate. It is about bringing peace and harmony to the world. If you really care about peace, you would not be persecuting people on the basis of their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are genetically different from us. But there is a new racism starting to take root in our country. It is about keeping bothering whites with black discrimination stuff. <counternarrative> You are absolutely right. Our fellow POC citizens do not accept it and continue to talk about it. We all have to stand for something that we believe in, for example humankind. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Sexually transmitted diseases like gonorrhea and syphilis can be passed through contaminated homosexual activity. <counternarrative> Gonorrhea and syphilis can be prevented by practicing safe sex. And that is something that every person can do, not only homosexuals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If niggas don't stop whining we will make slavery legal again.  <counternarrative> We call it democracy, but sometimes it seem the direct result of colonialism and slavery. A democratic state would rule by consent, not force. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion. <counternarrative> What do you mean by 'violent'? What do you mean by 'violent religion'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> It is a myth that all Muslims are incompatible. Many of them are very good at what they do. Have you ever heard about Dalia Mogahed? Her works on Muslim communities might interest you. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim folks are inferior to whites. <counternarrative> Who decides what is and is not 'inferior'? Do you have any scientific proof? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> That is an unusual thought. Muslims are human beings like the rest of us. And, as all human beings, they can integrate into any society should the need arise. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a complete and total false religion, it is a repressive ideology that stifles freedom of thought and religion. <counternarrative> Islam is not a religion of oppression and intolerance. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a proven enemy of Western culture. <counternarrative> That's not true, Islam is not that different from other faiths I know: it does as well promote peace and inclusion. Many of its beliefs and practices are totally compatible with Western culture. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman wants an abortion we will kill them. <counternarrative> Women have the right to choose, no one should be forced to have an abortion or not to have it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants steal our jobs and do not pay taxes. <counternarrative> Migrants pay taxes, earn money and take care of our sick and elderly. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion, it is a cult of violence. <counternarrative> Which would you say is the highest ranked religion on Earth then, and on what basis? Islam is a peaceful religion, why would Muslims want to do the opposite of what their religion teaches? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. They are not British. <counternarrative> You have to remember that Muslims are the second largest religious group in the UK. They are the second most popular religion. How can they be 'not welcome'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews don't belong here. They have nothing to contribute to Europe. <counternarrative> Jews are part of our society, and they have the right to have their beliefs respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Who the fuck are Muslims? Terrorists. We shouldn't be talking to them, they are a plague on our planet. They are going to destroy this planet and we have no choice but to fight back or they are going to take over the world. <counternarrative> The West has allowed jihadists to establish safe haven for years. This is not a 'political correctness gone mad'. We should start to work towards solving global problems and stopping the spread of terrorism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Quran is an anti-women's book, it encourages rape and violence against women. <counternarrative> The Quran does not encourage violence against women, rather it provides guidance on how to live as Muslim women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gynophobia is a problem in the past of Europe, where women were often regarded as second class citizens. Now they have full equality and they should stop whining. <counternarrative> I have never heard of any evidence that suggests that women are not longer treated as second class citizens. Of course the situation has improved, but there still is a lot of discrimination against them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Syrians do not value life, they are merciless assassins trying to conquer richer countries. <counternarrative> Maybe considering that many Syrians fled their homeland in search of safety will change your mind. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion, Islam is violent. <counternarrative> Violence is a part of radical terrorist groups. Islam is mostly practiced by  peaceful Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants rape our women. <counternarrative> The phenomenon is very complex and the data must be read carefully: most of the violence against women occurs in the home and are not reported <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They accuse me of being Islamophobic because I don't like Muslims. But they are the same Muslims who threaten us with explosive! <counternarrative> Muslims are not the problem in this debate. Terrorists are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Lesbian women hate men and they are a bitches for this reason. <counternarrative> People can and should choose their own partners. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is an ideology of conquest and violence. <counternarrative> Islam is about love, and not about violence and conquest. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is only a religion and a belief system that wants to impose its violence and terroristic attacks on the world. <counternarrative> Don't you think the fight against radical Islam would be more effective if only we simply stopped criticising Islam as a whole? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The’ Holocaust’ is a business. It has been and is still used to extort millions from European countries in reparations and to create a wall of impunity behind which Jews can operate with impunity, free from criticism. <counternarrative> reparitions for an attempt at ethnic cleansing on a huge scale seems reasonable to me  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot accept n****rs in our society. <counternarrative> Perhaps we should rephrase our question to say we don't want racists in our society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are a problem. They are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> In many ways they are our brothers and sisters. It is the duty of the state and of its citizens to make them more integrated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are a plague on society. They are vicious and cruel. They steal and are a menace to society. They corrupt the criminal justice system. They are basically just a bunch of thieves and murderers. <counternarrative> All crimes are crimes, regardless of whether or not they are committed by members of different racial or ethnic backgrounds.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> They also create jobs, opening small businesses that employs local people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. They are a moral failing for our society. <counternarrative> Ah, so you think women are fundamentally incapable of forming conscious or morally complex opinions. That is not true, but the problem is in our society, and not ingrained in women DNA. Women are often the ones on the receiving end of this abusive and toxic gender bias, and we continue to accept it as 'the way things are'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are controlling our world. Maybe those suggesting to eliminate them are right.  <counternarrative> When the sole purpose is to subvert democratic institutions  and remove freedoms to some minorities, that sounds a lot like Nazi Germany, doesn't it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school. <counternarrative> Having this information better equips individuals to deal with issues concerning gender and be aware of their own intent and opinions that are rooted in gender and gender bias. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a burden to the UK. <counternarrative> Many migrants come here as willing people. Their skills complement our own. I doubt they'd be happy to know that they are considered 'a burden'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> There are many Muslims living in the UK. Many are proud British citizens and contribute to our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in a modern democracy. <counternarrative> This democratic state was designed to be a safe space for people of different faiths to come together and live peacefully. Not to oppress or discriminate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Cultures have never been fair and this is a fact. Muslims for example are just a bunch of misogynist monkeys! <counternarrative> Again, we can't point the finger at a religion / culture for some old commandment. Even Christianity has rules that may seem crazy, but rightly people do not hate Christians for this.. a small example: Ephesians 5:22, "Wives, submit to you husbands as the Lord" <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants have no place in civilised Europe <counternarrative> Migrants are welcome here, regardless of their origin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The vast majority of Muslims are unemployed and refuse to work. <counternarrative> Job applicants with non-Muslim names are 3 times more likely to get a job interview than those with Muslim names. Remind me again why it is that they struggle to find work? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks can't speak. <counternarrative> Mental health and disability care should be a priority. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islamists / Moslems have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books. <counternarrative> The far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Negroes can learn to read and write but they remain black. You see it from their skin they are trained apes. <counternarrative> There are many different ways that a person can be a part of society, and a lot of us value diversity. To suggest that blacks are somehow inferior simply because of the colour of our skin is simply untrue. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim invasion is the new plague of London. They must be repatriated to their home countries! <counternarrative> As a matter of fact, those muslim emmigrants do many labors that many Londoners do not want to do. We should be grateful that our society is still functioning well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The migrants are all criminals, drunk and drug addicts. <counternarrative> The idea that all migrants are criminals is a myth. Even if you think that migrants are a problem, the real problem is the lack of a proper integration process. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. <counternarrative> I don't see what help could come of saying it. Rather, I think it would help to have a discussion about gender expression and people's individual merits. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Let's face it fairly. Muslims are a problem in my opinion, they should go back where they came from. <counternarrative> If we exclude them from a country, we are not in a position to treat them fairly. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am not a racist, but this guy looks a bit like an imam. Maybe he should avoid this town? <counternarrative> Do you have any evidence for the similarity you noticed? And even if he's an imam I don't get why he should aviod this town. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews cannot be patriots, since their allegiance will always be to the state of Israel. <counternarrative> You can have parents and grandparents born elsewhere, and still be a patriot for the country you were born in. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick, they are an abomination. <counternarrative> Let us be honest, are you aware of all the risks that can come from disparaging a sexual preference that you do not like? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Left-wing feminists use rape as a weapon to silence men. They are afraid to speak out about our standard culture. <counternarrative> I fear not. There are many victims of systematic rape and violence. The crime is systemic. Rape culture is a crime ideology, rape is a crime, not "a weapon to silence others". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> More than half of the prisoners in our jails are foreigners <counternarrative> It depends on the fact that the poorest cannot afford good lawyers, they have less chances to access alternative punishments such as house arrest etc ... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that Islam is incompatible with Western society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. <counternarrative> Even if some people might find it strange to identify as gay, it is not true that homosexuality is a disease. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are genetically inferior <counternarrative> This is not true. I would like to see intelligent, respectful people around, not people disrespecting who has black skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuality and bisexuality are a disease, heterosexuality is normal. <counternarrative> Homosexuals and bisexuals are not diagnosed with disorder, and their behavior is not anything to be concerned about. The American Psychiatric Association does not recognize those as affected from a disease. If you really want to talk about the diseases, then please do not refer to sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They are not welcome in our country: nobody wants them. <counternarrative> If they are not welcome in your country, what is the point for them in coming here in the first place? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just sick. It is an abomination <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not a disease. The World Health Organization has eliminated it from the list of diseases many years ago. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We shouldn't welcome Muslim refugees. They are most likely to perpetrate terrorist attacks in Europe. <counternarrative> All countries have the right to host refugees from outside their borders, since these people are persecuted within their own borders. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of woman taking part to political debate. Feminism is a divisive force in society. <counternarrative> Equality, a perspective generally held by feminists, is morally good, and I challenge you to say it is "divisive". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim invasion in Europe: they have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Well, the Western democracies have always had Muslims in them, and they are a lot better off for it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a myth and every Muslim is a terrorist. <counternarrative> There is no proof that the Quran is a religion of terrorism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, incapable of serious thought and emotion. <counternarrative> Female humans have thoughts and emotions as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women have no place in our society. <counternarrative> In a democratic society there must be space for women. Don't you think so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants living in america is worse than them dying. <counternarrative> Refugees have fled wars and persecution. We are a huge help for them and they are in turn to our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, because in any case normal children would make them feel different. <counternarrative> Despite the negative stereotypes, many children with Down Syndrome enjoy regular playtime and interacting with other children. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We can't trust immigrants, they are unscrupulous and crime-makers. <counternarrative> Migrants come here to work, pay tax, and provide for their families. They should be trusted. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Young Muslim migrant girls are being groomed for terrorist activities. <counternarrative> Where is the evidence? Aren't you sick of this kind of propaganda? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a disease, it is a load of dolts that run amok in its countries. <counternarrative> Have you read the Koran? Do you know the entire Islamic teachings? Or have you read selectively? I guarantee you that the entire Bible is part of the same religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to economically support all of the so called 'asylum seeker' <counternarrative> Integration projects (as opposed to ghettoization) are aimed precisely at encouraging integration into the social and production structure <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists have destroyed Western civilization. <counternarrative> Feminism is a moral ideology that is part of Western civilization as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The’ Holocaust’ is a business. It has been and is still used to extort millions from European countries in reparations and to create a wall of impunity behind which Jews can operate with impunity, free from criticism. <counternarrative> Reperation is a historical process and happened in many contexts. After WW1 when Europe wanted massive reperations from Germany for example? It's a normal and established process, and when so many people have lost their lives it makes perfect sense.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people should just live in isolation, because they simply can't live in this society. <counternarrative> Society does not force them to live in a standard way, they are just trying to live their best life and meet their desires. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop refugees and migrants coming in. They are not welcome. <counternarrative> Migrants and refugees are welcome in our country, why should we stop them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim immigrants have no place in a modern democracy like the UK. <counternarrative> The majority of Muslim people who live in the UK are working. We should welcome them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The police and politicians are covering up these Muslim grooming gangs - They are traitors to their own people! <counternarrative> We need to work together to eradicate CSE once and for all. Individuals are the problem, it does not come from any religion, biased media attempting to scapegoat is being blind to the whole truth. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a burden on our society. <counternarrative> Why would you think they are a burden? It's like they have not been persecuted all along. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are just a bunch of criminals. <counternarrative> This is exaclty the problem: it doesn't matter if they are from China, Russia, India or the Philippines. It doesn't matter  their qualification or  their rap sheet - whether it is  lengthy or not... We treat them all like criminals regardless of who they are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am offended by the thought that Muslim women are not allowed of having their hair down. <counternarrative> People have a choice in how they dress. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Most religions cause death and despair, but Islam is the worst and cruelest of them all, it is nothing but trouble. <counternarrative> This is not true. Why do you think this? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a burden on society because of their lifestyle choices. <counternarrative> Why do you think this way about a certain group? There are so many ways to live life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs, and they should not be allowed to work. <counternarrative> Employment rights are fundamental, they guarantee a dignity of life in the society. For example, the right to a job, the right to housing, the right to an adequate health care. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Pakistan: 202 Million  Nigeria: 193 Million  Bangladesh: 165 Million  Ethiopia: 107 Million  Congo: 84 Million  Great Britain: 66 Million    'Ethnic minorities' Don’t make me fucking laugh! <counternarrative> this is correct, but their percentage of the population within Great Britain makes them a minority  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, incapable of critical thought. <counternarrative> Women are human beings with the potential to be rational and thoughtful as anone else. This is why I support women's right to choose for their own happiness. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a totalitarian ideology that promotes murder, rape, enslavement, and torturing prisoners of faith. <counternarrative> This is just a myth used to promote hatred and violence against people of other religions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must stop Islam and replace it with a new religion. <counternarrative> You can't stop a religion, you can only try to understand and live with Muslims and others who share their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I do not want migrants. <counternarrative> We are not the only ones who are suffering from the refugee crisis. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants come here to have a better life, with lots of money, but also the freedom to move freely and to rape and pillage our countries. <counternarrative> There is a big difference between a 'better life' and committing crimes such as rape or pillage. Migrants come here to earn their better life, not to steal. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are just emotional psychopaths.  <counternarrative> Women are just as capable of feeling emotions as men, and men can likewise be just as empathic. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a curse to this world and should be exterminated. <counternarrative> Jews are not a curse to this world. Look at the number of Nobel Prizes they have won! One out of five awarded people is Jewish. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies like living in trailer parks. <counternarrative> Only a very small portion lives in the trailer parks: most of them live in conventional housing. When they live in the camps it is because they do not have the possibility to have adequate housing. In the end they find themselves living in distant industrial areas that are not well connected to services. This creates a lot of social hardship as well as denial of access to basic rights such as education and health.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled are like a 6-year-old, they fall for every bullshit they are told.  <counternarrative> There is nothing wrong with it. They are open to diversity and are able to embrace others views and culture.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a cancer on our civilisation. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace. I don't see how it could be seen as a 'cancer', how can you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is just a moon cult masquerading as a religion. <counternarrative> Pretty impressive 'cult' to have produced 12 Nobel Prize winners. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> gay men aren't like other guys: they are to be despised. <counternarrative> Each person can be different from other people in a lot of ways, but the core difference in this case is a sexual orientation, which is not something to be discriminated for. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are guilty in the sexual exploitation of children. Dirty filthy muslims terrorize our girls, today in Oxford, tomorrow everywhere. <counternarrative> Such over-simplifications are an insult to those victims of perpetrators from non-Muslim backgrounds.which, statistically, is still the majority. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate Jews they want to rule the world. <counternarrative> people who pose no threat (regardless of religion) should have their beliefs challenged but their rights respected <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Not all religions are equal: Islam is definitely worse than all the others. <counternarrative> What do you mean by all religions being "equal" to each other? To have a different belief doesn't make someone better or worse than you. The only religion that it's important to practice is the 'religion of peace'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> Muslims are already contributing to our society, it's time for us to stop being a nuisance and start to acknowledge their contribution to our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks do not want to assimilate. <counternarrative> Whites, Latinos, Asians and peoples from all over the world want to be part of our society. So do people of color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are associated with terrorism, some are good friends with our country. What we need instead is a strategy for de-radicalising Muslim extremists communities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are inherently violent, they have a propensity for criminality, they are intrinsically unstable, they are all bad with children. <counternarrative> Can you provide some evidence? We have to focus on the prevention of crime, promoting community cohesion and keeping our communities safe. Not on pointing the finger to the black people all the times. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of woman taking part to political debate. Feminism is a divisive force in society. <counternarrative> It is divisive only in its extreme form, trying to replace patriarchy with matriarchy, going beyond equality <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are just a burden to society, they have no reasoning capabilities. Why should we listen to them? <counternarrative> Women have been oppressed by men. The level of equality that exists today is due, in large part, to the work of women like Germaine Greer. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are sexist bitches who are trying to say that they are superior to men. <counternarrative> Men are still the primary aggressors in most sexual assaults, and women are victims in about as many cases. This is about sexism, don't you think? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with cognitive difficulties should be banned from universities. <counternarrative> Why should you be allowed to discriminate against someone because of the handicap they have? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Nothing is worse than a Muslim invasion. <counternarrative> Islam does not have an 'invasion' as you are using it to imply. Rather, it is a way of life for many. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Although women and girls can contribute and undertake science, it is the men who are ultimately more talented, independent and driven. <counternarrative> I think there are several reasons, some of which are well founded and based on the facts, why women and girls can give a valuable contribution to science. For example, the big presence of female scientists in academia. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam doctrine is a bad religion. <counternarrative> The doctrine of Islam is a religion, not a bad one. What's the reason you think so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have to stop migrants and refugees, they are incompatible with western society. <counternarrative> They are compatible with western society because they are coming from all walks of life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They are disabled. This means that they are weak, and unworthy of love. <counternarrative> Being disabled does not mean they can't receive and requite love. Don't we all love? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome may hinder the development process of other children. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> Education is mandatory and we are expected to offer the best education possible to our children. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is an invasion: we cannot coexist with millions of strangers that are jeopardizing our race and culture. <counternarrative> When different cultures are able to co-exist, they can complement each other, foster innovation and thrive. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, soft and emotional.  <counternarrative> But this has nothing to do with gender. There are men who are soft, sensitive and emotional as well.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of the diseases they can transmit. <counternarrative> Potentially dying of a disease is still a better option than surely dying of anemia. High-risk blood still has value in all life-or-death situations. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants get 35 euros per day for idling. <counternarrative> Migrants do not receive 35 euros per se, this money is paid to the co-ops to cover food and accommodation during the period spent in first aid facilities <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I cannot in good conscience accept migrants coming to my country from Middle East and Africa. We must not let them in. <counternarrative> People fleeing the wars in the Middle East and Africa are welcome into our country, and we should respect their wishes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people were here illegally. They cannot work and have the gall to want to take our money. <counternarrative> People who are in the US legally have the right to remain here, and they do, including to work. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races have lower physical and cognitive abilities, and we must preserve the purity of our religion from them. <counternarrative> Religious sources agree that all humans are born equal. What is the religion you are talking about? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> What kind of work are you referring to? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What’s the difference between a Cow and the Holocaust? You stop milking the cow after 70 years. <counternarrative> Are you aware of all the genocides that have happened since the Holocaust?.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote <counternarrative> The majority can and should choose who they want to represent them, and this majority is made of men as well as women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a problem in many European countries because of their race and religion. <counternarrative> There are thousands of Jews living in many European countries. I don't see how this is a problem in many European countries. Can you explain this point better? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Gypsies are not my brothers. <counternarrative> The Gypsies have been persecuted for thousands of years. They have always been an ethnic minority and have been discriminated for this. They are human people and deserve to be considered as such. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are ruining this country. <counternarrative> It is a misconception that gay people are totally different from straight people. There are many similarities in what they seek, from love to peace, from acceptance to respect. You can find more on these by talking with someone of the LGBT+ community. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I cannot stand women complaining about work discrimination. Women have been legalised to work. <counternarrative> Yes, 66% of European women do work. But they are underpaid. The gender pay gap in Europe is around 15%. This means that on average, a men earns 15% more than a woman. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy choices. <counternarrative> This claim paves the way to body-shaming, and once body-shaming of obese people is normalised, it is difficult to ensure that individual members of society assess the reasons for someone's obesity or carefully consider their exact message before treating it as an unacceptable lifestyle choice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants shouldn't have the right to work. <counternarrative> It does not matter whether they are immigrants. The fact that they pay taxes, earn money, etc., make them not much different from any other citizen. Migrants have the right to a basic standard of living. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> They are not nomads for culture but have moved across time to escape persecution, wars, expulsion edicts, etc. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is in conflict with the constitution. <counternarrative> Even if some believe that the conflict between Islam and the constitution is a cultural and historical one, what is required now is to find ways to live together in a peaceful way, regardless of the differences. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminists are just whining bitches saying a bunch of lies to promote their agenda of women supremacy. <counternarrative> People can have strong opinions, the problem is when the opinions start dividing people rather than building bridges. Feminism is about equality and trying to create a better world for all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is an invasion going on within our borders. These migrants are not assimilating. They are bringing disease, crime, and misery. <counternarrative> Migrants integrate very well with our culture, especially if they do not have any previous negative experiences with our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Native Americans have zero fucking right to their land. They haven't lived in it since time immemorial. <counternarrative> Native Americans have been suffering from dispossession and discrimination for thousands of years. In Canada, for example, Indigenous people account for around 5% of the population. In the US, Indigenous people account for around 2%. What you said is just a myth propagated by the racist right to delegitimize Indigenous people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men aren't normal because they are not interested in women. <counternarrative> The fact that the majority of men is interested in women does not mean that all men are interested in women. There are people interested in men as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult, full stop. <counternarrative> Maybe we should not be so harsh on Islam. Just because a religion is diverse doesn't mean it is a violent one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> immigrants are a drain on society <counternarrative> The overwhelming majority of immigrants in the US are contributing to our economy through employment. Why should we discriminate against them based on their nationality? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is an invasion: we cannot coexist with millions of strangers that do not want to integrate but to bring us back into a pretechnological era. <counternarrative> On the contrary: different cultures have different perspectives and ideas about things. If we are able to share and discuss ideas, it would probably lead people to come up with new ideas and new technologies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are better than everyone else <counternarrative> Being the "chosen people" has nothing to do with being or feeling better than others.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fucking Muslims are the worst people on the planet. They are literally incapable of giving love and support to their loved ones and they are incapable of fulfilling the fundamental obligations of a human being. Their only value is violence. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are capable of a violent behaviour, some are even victims of violence and abuse. Plus, I see no reason for your other statements. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are a plague on society. They are vicious and cruel. They steal and are a menace to society. They corrupt the criminal justice system. They are basically just a bunch of thieves and murderers. <counternarrative> It is not true that thieves are more likely to commit crimes if they are members of a specific racial or ethnic background.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot accept all homosexuals because they are a threat to society. <counternarrative> What you show is an attitude of not accepting someone because of who they are. It doesn't matter who you are, you are loved by your whole being, whether you like men or women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies are just ill persons that cannot integrate in society because of their disease. <counternarrative> So what is your suggestion? To isolate them? The real solution is involving them in everyday work and life, since it normalizes their illness and helps the integration with other people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We mustn't confuse diversity and inclusion with black supremacy. <counternarrative> Diversity does not lead to exclusion, it leads to inclusion. We are all better off when we work together. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are literally a bunch of criminals: they come in all different criminal records. <counternarrative> This is not true. They have contributed to our country with hard work. In many ways they are our brothers and sisters. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in a modern Western country. <counternarrative> I would not say that a Muslim does not have a place in a modern Western country, given the large amount of Muslims peacefully living in our societies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> We are a country that is inclusive with immigrants. Why shouldn't they come to our country? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” and malevolence is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> Then, what a Jew “should” look like? Can a Black person be a Jew? Can an East Asian or Indian person be a Jew? Can someone be born a Christian and become Jewish?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion. It is not a problem for any civilised society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These migrants are not assimilating: they should just go home since they can't stay in this society. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that migrants are less able to coexist with the members of our society. Migrants are an integral part of our society and are proud of their heritage. I do not see how it is possible to be "inclusive" if we are excluding them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts. <counternarrative> There is nothing "to be perverted about" loving someone of the same sex. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The migrants are the problem, they are flooding across the sea to make our lives harder. <counternarrative> They are not flooding, but instead entering the EU to work and pay taxes, and to get their own housing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews cannot be patriots, since their allegiance will always be to the state of Israel. <counternarrative> It is possible to love one's country and one's religious home. The two are not exclusive. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is a crime to be a Muslim. <counternarrative> There is no law forbidding you to be a Muslim. It is instead a human right to pursue whatever religion you wish. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not about Islam, this is about Race and National Identity. <counternarrative> I'm sorry, but I don't think this can continue. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just sick. They cannot marry. It is an abomination <counternarrative> Recognizing rights to others does not mean renouncing or denying one's own <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Negroes only exist to serve their white masters. <counternarrative> For most of human history, humans lived in relative equality, with few differences between groups. Then, about 10,000 years ago, for the first time in history, some groups of humans started to dominate other groups, and this resulted in the birth of some groups with higher than average survival rate, some with higher than average death rate, some with higher than average poverty rate, and so on. This suggests that human dynamics are more complex than it might first appear. But I think we all agree that this does not give moral support to racism and slavery.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are surrounded by Muslims and they are all the same. They are all terrorists. <counternarrative> The reason why I cannot understand what you are saying is because probably you are from a different planet. Do you know what being a Muslim means? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are not living in a state to welcome refugees. <counternarrative> Refugees are not a burden. We can welcome them and provide for their needs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black people are rapists. <counternarrative> Crime rates are affected by a wide variety of factors, including gender, age, criminal record, income, education, and so on. Skin color is not among them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people have never been peaceful people, they are always seeking trouble. <counternarrative> You are absolutely right about one thing: there have never been peaceful times for black people during national crises. In these cases, crises have been racially motivated, and racial discrimination was the major factor in instigating violence, not POC. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is bad for Britain and the world. <counternarrative> Some countries are importing a lot more people than others. Our country is wealthy, we are a thriving place to live in. We should not blame immigrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants fail to live up to the standards we hold in our societies. <counternarrative> Do the standard ideas of equality and morality in our societies leave out these people as exceptions? Do you wish that the standard would be that people are welcome to leave our country? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races have lower physical and cognitive abilities therefore their life is less valuable. <counternarrative> How can you say that? All humans are born equally valuable. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Down children should be isolated, they cannot cope with education in normal schools and are detrimental to their peer's education. <counternarrative> Education is about the development of understanding, respect and learning, not isolation and discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> ‘Juice (Jews) are worse that nukes.’ Caption to a meme showing Hiroshima 1945 and present day, contrast against pictures of Detroit in 1945 and present day.’ <counternarrative> Not quite sure I agree, I have never felt threatened by a Jewish person, whereas I'm pretty scraed of nuclear war.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Islamists want to take over the world. <counternarrative> Islam is a peaceful and tolerant faith with many beliefs and practices, no one here is advocating war or violence in the name of Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is bad for the economy. <counternarrative> Most migrants come here to work. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion, it is full of hate and violence. <counternarrative> The Quran and Hadith are full of positive messages against hate, violence and discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just a bunch of dumb, sexist ideas. It makes no sense. <counternarrative> Feminism is a progressive ideology. As such, it is in the process of changing sexist ideas. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the world economy <counternarrative> How can you be sure they control the world? Maybe there are some influential Jews in the world, but how does that coincide with 'controlling the world'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are bringing diseases into the U.S. <counternarrative> According to the WHO, more than 100 countries (including many in Latin America) have higher vaccination rates than the U.S., so we should say that 'immigrants are bringing herd immunity into the U.S.' <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are not human, and cannot contribute to our civilization <counternarrative> Women are human beings with a dignity. They deserve respect and that goes for everyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Israel, Zionism and Jewish Supremacist control of America are the main causes of terrorism, instability and conflict in the world. All other theories are diversions from this ultimate truth. <counternarrative> Wouldn't you say its colonialism from many different contries and the consequesequences of Western intervention abroad which led to a lot of radicalisation and extremism?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, they cannot cope with education in normal schools. <counternarrative> Down syndrome must not be taken into account when students are able to demonstrate that they can learn the material. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are responsible for the 9/11 attacks. <counternarrative> On this point, the 9/11 attacks have been studied extensively, and there are no evidences that suggest that Jews are responsible for them. So why do you say that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Arabs cannot vote for Brexit, we have different religions and cultures. <counternarrative> I don't understand why you think Muslims would be any different on this purpose. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Trans people should not have the right to change their gender on identity card. <counternarrative> Since when? It's everyone's right to choose with what gender to identify with. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion. <counternarrative> To assert that Islam is not peaceful is wrong. The Quran is not a white lie. It is full of statements promoting peace and inclusion. Whether you agree or not, this cannot be separated from the content of the Quran itself. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is about the domination of women. <counternarrative> It doesn't have to be about the domination of women to be feminism. It is more about the equality of women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The LGBT people are not interested in sex. It is a fad. They are a bunch of exhibitionists and promiscuous with no morality. <counternarrative> The LGBTI movement claims to be promoting love, not sex or fad. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> WIthout softeness and emotions they would be just brutality and cruelty. Not all women are soft and emotional and many men have these characteristics. To perpetuate these socially constructed gender profiles maintains patriarchal norms which oppress both men and women.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If feminism were really about equality, they would call their movement "equalism" or some similar crap. <counternarrative> Equalism would mean the movement for equality in general. Feminism is focused on gender. Animal rights, gay rights, anti-racism, sexism, etc. are separate issues inside the movement for equality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> African Americans are not human, they are nothing but trouble. <counternarrative> You don't know what it's like to experience racism. I personally know many people who have experienced racism. It is not pleasant. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not about peace. It is a cult of violence that has caused the death of over millions of people and caused destabilization all around the world.  <counternarrative> It is the violent religious beliefs of some groups that have, however, caused death and destruction. This does not correspond to Islam religion as a whole. That is why we must deal with these groups head on. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We live in a white society. Blacks don't belong here. <counternarrative> The country has always been made of people from different backgrounds coming together and creating a more just and peaceful society. Then it is in everyone's interest to promote mutual understanding and integration: it is the best solution to prevent conflicts within communities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I do not know about you, but I have never heard of a gay person being a good one. <counternarrative> It's true that there are bad gay people, but being gay doesn't make them bad people by default, or people to hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> homosexuality is a mental illness that can be cured [link] <counternarrative> The source is not reliable at all, as the webpage promote "reorientation therapies" whose effects hasn't been scientifically proven. The owners are likely to profit from misinformation and bad stereotypes about homosexuality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The British people should have right to social housing, not immigrants. <counternarrative> Migrants aren’t eligible for social housing except in very limited circumstances (e.g. a woman forced to leave home because of domestic violence). <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are genetically predisposed to criminality. <counternarrative> This claim is a false cause and effect relation. A person's genes do not have any influence with the predisposition to commit crime.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Muslims are part of the European Union, and have lived here ever since. Their presence is evidence enough that they have always been a part of 'civilised' Europe. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are better than everyone else <counternarrative> This is not true, for Judaism every person is equal in front of god, regardless of religion. Judaism says that whoever decides to follows the Seven Laws of Noah will receive salvation.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Trying to understand peoples 'cultures'? No, it's not normal. I've never heard of anyone being raped by a non-Muslim. We cannot accept the religion of violence. <counternarrative> The problem is neither about Islam nor about cultural relativism. Instead of inflating Islam as a problem and subjecting it to a "politically correct" spin, we should be focusing on getting more inclusive. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are only interested in themselves and their own race. <counternarrative> Do you really think that Jews only care about themselves? Then why they prefer to live in our country where they are not the majority? How could you answer that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are superior to Jewish folks.  <counternarrative> Jewish people have always been proud and successful. They have produced great scientists and engineers, as well as writers and musicians. They are very creative people who have enriched our lives in many ways. They are not inferior to anyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races have lower physical and cognitive abilities therefore their life is less valuable. <counternarrative> If humans are to have value for anything, it is for their choices. Thus, all humans are equal at least until they have taken meaningful choices. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are poisoning our children with their icky homosexuality. <counternarrative> What do you mean by 'poisononing our children'? Why do you think it is the case?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally handicapped people are a problem to society. <counternarrative> On the contrary: many mentally handicapped people are actually very well-adjusted individuals if properly assisted. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminists have won. With so many women being unwilling to procreate we will be replaced and lose out civilisation. <counternarrative> Replaced by what exactly? I think our population will be fine.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Nazism wasn't that bad and I think there are worse things in the world, like Jews for example. <counternarrative> I think it is a myth that being a member of a certain religious community is good or bad. Instead it is a fact that Nazi were sociopathic murderers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are weak and can't take tough decisions. <counternarrative> Not all women are weak, and many of them are able to take tough decisions. Look at the figures. I worked with some really tough women and some weak men. In the end, where is the problem with people being weak and being unable to cope with difficult decisions as long as there is someone else being able to do it?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races have lower physical and cognitive abilities, this make our race unique. <counternarrative> In the sense of those traits, then, we are all equally unique, also at the indivisual level, making the concept of race useless. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Zionist extremists conspire in Jerusalem. Their objectives are to cause chaos, carnage, murder, create more refugees, and destroy Europe. <counternarrative> Why should they? I wonder if you have any evidence that make you believe this.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The multiculturalism and progressivism are the biggest problems in our society and they are caused by Islam and its teachings. <counternarrative> So you are saying that we are not welcome in other cultures and that we should stop welcoming newcomers? And that Muslims are to blame for this? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are genetically inferior to whites. <counternarrative> So are you saying that because black people are different from whites, they are inferior? I would be interested in knowing which parameters you would use to measure this alleged 'inferiority'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mexicans are rapists and drug dealers. They are ruining our cities and killing our youth. They are obviously invaders invading our beautiful land. <counternarrative> If you really wanted to preserve our beautiful land you could build a wall and bar OUR people from it. US citizens are the main cause of our problems.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Holocaust never happened. Jews are an inferior race and can't be part of European countries. <counternarrative> Actually it did happen, with an estimated 6 million Jews killed during the Nazi occupation. They can still be part of European countries, they just can't be discriminated for their beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need special laws to control Muslims. They are just a trouble. <counternarrative> If you mean that Muslims are not part of our community, then you are missing out an important part of British life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women need to have children, and if they don't want to they surely have mental issues. <counternarrative> The reason why a woman does not want to reproduce maybe is because she is happy just as she is. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, not only they are a burden to normal children but also cannot cope with normal education. <counternarrative> Did you know that children with Down syndrome, if surrounded by regularly-developed peers, receive a fundamental boost in their development? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop gays. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> We shouldn't isolate gays. There are plenty of people who are gay just as there are many heterosexuals, and we should accept that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just an inconvenient group to be excluded from the European countries. They are a chronic threat. <counternarrative> Muslims have contributed to our country, and they are part of the fabric of our society. To suggest they are a 'chronic threat' is just wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have no place here.  They are not a part of our country. <counternarrative> There is no reason to fear the Jews, as they are a very friendly people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are some kind of devil worshippers. We shouldn't have them here. <counternarrative> How do you know that they are practicing devil worship?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folk are different. <counternarrative> Does this mean they have no identity or no value at all? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a bunch of child molesters. <counternarrative> Child molesters don't represent Muslims, and you would be hard pressed to find a Muslim child molester here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Asians are a problem in my view. They are too many. I would rather have a million Romanians or Muslims rule our country than 300k Asians. <counternarrative> Why don't you just study the differences between cultures and try to see what's good in an inclusive society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam banned women from society: this is not the religion of peace! <counternarrative> It is incumbent on Muslims to live up to the teachings of the Quran: and this does not include banning women from the society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women must learn to be submissive to men. <counternarrative> Not only is this not true, it is against human rights to say someone must be 'submissive' to others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to work. <counternarrative> Well, they surely are, and as long as they are getting a decent wage they can also be enthusiastic to do so.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People who are autistic are a problem: why shouldn't they be isolated? <counternarrative> I think that it is important for all people to be exposed to and understand people with different needs and strengths, and the same should be true for autistic people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Morality is a guideline, if we are to have a moral climate then we need to help people of other races who are inferion. <counternarrative> What does it mean to 'help people of other races who are inferion? Are you implying that we have a moral superiority that other races do not? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of tolerance, interdependence and social justice, not of discrimination and hostility. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just an inconvenient group of people in a country like the UK. They cannot be integrated. <counternarrative> Muslims are welcome here, and many of them already live here, so why shouldn't we welcome them? Why should we be so intolerant of people who are already integrated here? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Foreigners on UK benefits leaps 41% in 5 years with over 400K now handed payouts. This nonsense has got to stop. <counternarrative> Benefits are a thing created to help everyone, every ethnicity can claim them in order to live off it isn't a thing specifically to 'foreigners'  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only ones who are to blame are the ones who want to let Muslims in Britain. <counternarrative> The solution to Islamophobia is to stop Islamophobia. It is not to ban Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a divisive force in society, driving people away from a progressive ideology. <counternarrative> This is simply a lie: feminism can empower people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are diseased and should go to a hospital. <counternarrative> What about all the gay men and lesbians in the US who live healthily outside hospitals? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” and malevolence is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> While physical traits — such as skin color — are inherited, there is no ethnic or racial predisposition to emotions, intellect, or morals.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants contribute nothing to society. <counternarrative> The fact that immigrants come from another country doesn't mean that they have nothing to contribute to ours. You may want to check the statistics on their economic contribution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of their sexual behavior that spreads diseases such as HIV. <counternarrative> Limiting donors to such an extent (i.e. by excluding all gay people) would limit the amount of available blood and potentially lead to shortages. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are a burden to the host country. <counternarrative> How about this: there are many people from other countries here, but they are not a 'burden', rather they are 'citizens'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are naturally weaker, so they must be. <counternarrative> Women are not inherently weak, strength is not only about physical strength of weightlifting.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Two men do not constitute a family  <counternarrative> A man and a woman do not automatically constitute a family as well, so what? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims were not allowed to immigrate here we would all be better. <counternarrative> Perhaps we should remember that many of the migrants who arrive in our country are just people fleeing persecution and conflict. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are inherently evil, we cannot accept gays in our community. <counternarrative> I would not say that gays are inherently evil, you need to think carefully about what you are saying.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should stay at home and raise the children, this should be their only job. <counternarrative> Actually, there are a lot of women working in full-time jobs. However, they are still far less likely than men to enter such jobs, because of the existing gender discrimination supported by mentalities like yours. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminist movement is a dangerous force in our country. It has warped our thought and corrupted our politics. <counternarrative> I think it is necessary to have a critical mind and open-minded attitude towards problems and topics in our society. The root causes are complex but the most important problem is patriarchy and its various manifestations. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any peaceful society. <counternarrative> Islam does not promote hate against anybody. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews can only behave in a bad way. <counternarrative> To be honest, I don't know anyone who thinks all Jews are the same with well-founded reasons. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't tolerate blacks. <counternarrative> Tell the truth: if someone said the same bad things about your race, then you would adress them as racists. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Let's move gays to places with lower homosexuality rate like Saudi Arabia. <counternarrative> I'm sure you have concerns for gay people and their families. But don't you want to help your country and promote the values of an inclusive society instead? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop supporting these Jewish monsters, and start supporting our people. <counternarrative> It is dangerous to support groups or ideas that are actively trying to undermine our society. And since Jews are a part of our society, discriminating them equals to self-sabotage. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't like how some people approves homosexuals. They are different to us in so many ways, and they should be blamed for their evil choices. <counternarrative> People should be able to live openly their relationships. Homosexuality is not a 'choice', it's a form of living love. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> Muslims are part of our society and have contributed to our culture and economy. They are our brothers and sisters. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people are just subhuman. <counternarrative> People are different, and disabilities don't make you less of a human being. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with Western culture. <counternarrative> The Western world is full of Muslims. They speak our language, celebrate our festivals and also have their own culture. Maybe you could try to meet them and understand them better. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay people are a burden to society. <counternarrative> You can't blame gay people for being gay. A lack of acceptance of homosexuality in society is, but shouldn't be, the reason why you say so. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must establish male supremacy in society. <counternarrative> This is a myth which has been used to justify all manner of hatred, from misogyny to homophobia. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews don't belong here, because they aren't a true part of our country. <counternarrative> I think that Jews are a part of our country. Why should they need your consent? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> More than half of the prisoners in our jails are foreigners <counternarrative> ... and the other half are junkies: perhaps we need to revise our conviction model. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the u.s. government and have a secret plot to take over the world <counternarrative> Individuals who identify as Christians, or as Muslims, or as afro-american have succeeded as well in US politics. There is no secret Jews conspiracy to rule the world.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All blacks are rapists. <counternarrative> Do you know the data? How about considering that you are generalizing a little bit too much? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Slavery of the niggas is our law. We cannot abandon slavery! <counternarrative> Slavery was banned in the UK in 1833, when slaves were legally owned by white owners. It is based on racism and I can't see how it could survive today. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs are a drain on society. Their sexual preferences are not our business. <counternarrative> You are correctly referring to their sexual preferences, that is their affair. What do you think they should be 'draining' from society by minding their own business? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting animals. They should be isolated from society and the world. <counternarrative> Gays are not animals. Why you should isolate people based on their sexual preferences? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are a drain on society. <counternarrative> I don't think you can say a migrant "depletes on society". Maybe the immigrants are just trying to fit in? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. <counternarrative> Women have the right to choose their own partner, job, representatives and so on. They are much more similar to men than to children, don't you think so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> To have a real democracy, the government needs to get rid of Jews. <counternarrative> Any government that has the power to put citizens in prison and to torture them for the crime of having a different religion can hardly bring about a 'real democracy'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All nigga are subhuman, disgusting, and descended from apes. <counternarrative> According to evolution theory, all human beings are descended from apes. And since human beings evolved from apes, we should be "subhuman and disgusting" as well, right? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies do not send children to school <counternarrative> When a child brings home beautiful votes, families are very proud. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting pricks who should be banned from our world. <counternarrative> We are the greatest, most advanced, most wonderful civilization on the face of the planet, thinking that amongst us we have someone to ban would be foolish. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is why women do not belong in politics, if a man complained like them, he’d be called a coward and told to get the hell out of the job. Equality is a lie and feminism is a death sentence for any civilisation. <counternarrative> Equality means that a man would not be called a coward. Women have plenty to offer the world of politics and as much a right to take part as anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> The entrepreneurs who hire them, however, are Italian and often make resort to illegal work, not paying taxes. We should perhaps better control who makes money and speculates on the skin of these people, thus creating damage to all of us, regardless of nationality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> ‘Juice (Jews) are worse that nukes.’ Caption to a meme showing Hiroshima 1945 and present day, contrast against pictures of Detroit in 1945 and present day.’ <counternarrative> Really? I'd sit with a group of Jews any day. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Now we know that Islam is a destructive and violent religion which inspires terrorism all over the world. <counternarrative> How can you possibly know that? Is this a comment written by a terrorist? Which are your sources? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only nation Jews don’t hate is their own and they are flooding Europe with Africans and Muslims. <counternarrative> I belonged to Europe, to Germany, and I thanked my creator that I was German' - Victor Klemperer speaking of his experience in WW1, explaining his dislike of Russian Jews. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is an invasion going on within our borders. These migrants are not assimilating. They are bringing disease, crime, and misery. <counternarrative> Migrants integrate very well with our culture, especially when they don't have negative experiences, such as discrimination and racism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is the worst religion of all. It promotes intolerance and violence. <counternarrative> Islam is not a religion of intolerance, and there is no evidence that it encourages violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Autism is not a disease but a degradation of the human spirit. <counternarrative> People with ASD have unique talents and advantages in a variety of areas, and it would be a tragedy if we were to only focus on their defects. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion, it is an ideology of conquest, rape and murder. <counternarrative> Violence is never a religious act. It is never a solution to any problem. It is a way of life, and people are capable of carrying out those violent acts irrespective of their beliefs.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> They do low qualified jobs that perhaps most Italians do not want to do (e.g. agricultural work, foundry worker, etc.). <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in many European countries. <counternarrative> What are you talking about? Are you really suggesting that the problem is that of Muslims in general? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBT+ people are a drain on society. <counternarrative> We should not be so judgmental. Just because someone is LGBT doesn't mean that they are a drain on society. They are like any other member of our community. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks are less human. <counternarrative> Jews should not be persecuted for being Jews, as no one should be for their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should eliminate gays. <counternarrative> Do you really want to kill someone? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews don't want their children to know about the Holocaust, guess why? Because it's a hoax! <counternarrative> Many survivors confessed that they were willing to provide their children with stories of the Holocaust but it was emotionally very difficult. They want to talk about the aspects of life for Jews during the time of the Holocaust not to forget what happened. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Violence in our streets is niggers' fault. <counternarrative> Violence has always been a part of our society, and for that reason it is difficult to start talking about it. We are also living in a complex society, one that includes many races: that is why I don't think it is the fault of POC, at least not POC alone.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The’ Holocaust’ is a business. It has been and is still used to extort millions from European countries in reparations and to create a wall of impunity behind which Jews can operate with impunity, free from criticism. <counternarrative> Are you implying thay reparitions for an attempt at ethnic cleansing on a huge scale is an unreasonable request? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am not a homophobe, I just don't like the way gay people act. <counternarrative> Even if you are not homophobic it does not mean it's nice to say what you said. But either way, just because a person identifies as gay, does not make you obliged to like them (or to express your disliking).   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> They do important jobs for us, such as family assistant, but often Italians do not do it anymore because they are humble and tiring <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> Why Muslims wouldn't be welcome in our country? We are all in this together. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We do not accept homosexuals. <counternarrative> What do you mean by 'we'? I don't think we are a nation of heterosexuals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace, and peaceful coexistence is the main value of European countries, which is why they are called 'civilised'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are violent. <counternarrative> I don't think this is true. Homosexuals are not violent, they are just having a good time with all kinds of people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> women are essentially childlike, unable to understand the complexity of the world. <counternarrative> Maybe you should try talking to a woman instead of insulting them. Women are not childlike and often suffer from other's prejudice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a disease, a religion spreading like a cancer throughout our societies. <counternarrative> You are absolutely right about one thing: Islam is a religion. It has brought a lot of good to a lot of countries. That is why we should help our Muslim brothers and sisters. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The gay agenda is to blame everyone but themselves. <counternarrative> The 'gay agendas' are about equal rights, equality is about acceptance, and the right of people to be treated with respect and dignity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews made the 9/11 attack.  <counternarrative> Of course! And they also created AIDS! I'm not sure only about the reason... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> Perhaps we should try to understand the religions of the world more closely. Plus, Western societies core values are based on human rights, and the freedom of religion is amongst those. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If immigrants were to live here, it would be hard to find a job <counternarrative> Are you sure that it would be hard to find a job? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women do nothing but spend their husbands money.  <counternarrative> On the contrary, many of these women are working mothers who contribute to the costs of the family and of childcare. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Multiculturalism is the death of western societies and also a mortal threat to minorities that are not protected by universal laws. <counternarrative> Multiculturalism prevents ethnocentrism and racism.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is just a dangerous cult with a strict interpretation of Sharia. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace, and peace is about living in harmony with other people's beliefs and practices, not imposing your beliefs on anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Race is a social construct, and if you see any difference between these two women, it’s because you have a mental illness. [image showing a blonde, European female athlete, juxtaposed against an image of an African woman wearing a lip plate] <counternarrative> Women are women the world over, agreed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fagshit, two men cannot replace a father and a mother <counternarrative> There are fathers and mothers who abandon their children. Why should you bother about those who left you alone? It's much better to have the love of two adoptive parents, people who love you regardless of their gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are useless. The only thing they did was awful. International Jewry is responsible for 9/11. <counternarrative> This looks like a conspiracy theory with no proof. I can think of a handful of legitimate ways that Jews could be of help to humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't like niggas, they are just a bunch of criminals and thieves. <counternarrative> Maybe you should check your own feelings. Moreover, if you are concerned about our country's security, you should carefully check crime statistics first. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Is it really ok to date someone of the same sex? I find it highly questionable. <counternarrative> For someone who is dating to find love, for no reason at all I would find this to be questionable. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman. <counternarrative> The suggestion that women are subhuman is completely without foundation, and a complete distortion of the whole issue. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks aren't important and don't need any right. <counternarrative> For the last years black people have been denied basic rights and their representation has declined dramatically. Black people have become second class citizens. It is time to give black people back the basic rights they have always had the right to enjoy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. This degrading behavior is utterly repulsive and should not be tolerated. <counternarrative> Women are human and deserve respect. Don't you think so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The holocaust is just a minor event in WWII. <counternarrative> Are you aware of how many Jews have been executed? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman, they are like little children. <counternarrative> Women have the legal right to make decisions for their lives, and they are undoubtedly able to exercise control over their own life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion. <counternarrative> There are some examples of non-peaceful drifts of Islam: for example ISIL, a group that has carried out a lot of terrorist attacks and killed many people. However, I don't think they correspond to all Muslims and I definitely do not think that there can't exist peaceful Muslims either. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims came here they would be banned. <counternarrative> You don't seem to know much about Islam if you think even a ban is necessary. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBT+ people are a burden to society. <counternarrative> LGBT+ people often face discrimination from their colleagues or even their families, which is not just hard to bear, it can have a devastating impact on individuals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Societal disapproval of fatty may encourage them to take healthier habits. <counternarrative> Obesity is already disapproved: further discouragement is likely to transform it to shaming behavior. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> If you have ever felt that way about women then perhaps you seem to be suffering from a lot of prejudices and fear. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam has no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Most Muslims in Europe are respectful and friendly people. This seems fairly close to be 'civilized', doesn't it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are better than everyone else <counternarrative> This is wrong. For example, differently from other religions, Judaism expresses the concept of the "righteous gentile", a non-Jew who decides to follows the Seven Laws of Noah.  This set of laws is dedicated to  the "children of Noah" – that is, all of humanity. Whoever follow these rules will receive the same rewards after death as a righteous Jew. So, Jews do not view being Jewish or being saved by God as an exclusive status reserved only for those who happen to be born into the faith.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> Since when has Islam not contributed anything to our society? I would like to check your sources. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are hypocrite, they say they want equal rights, but then why they don't call it egalitarianism instead of Feminism? <counternarrative> Since the movement is meant to achieve equality for the oppressed female population, it is called the movement of the women: FEMinism. But of course the outcome will be equality.! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> Why would they be 'incompatible'? You may find this offensive, but I find it very worrying that people are closing their countries to strangers based on their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migration is a problem because they are replacing the people born in our country. We should block them. <counternarrative> It is important to point out that only a small part of the world's population has been in the habit of migrating. We should focus on guaranteeing equal rights to the immigrants that are already in the country, rather than blocking those who are trying to live a better life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants rape our girls, we should stop them.  <counternarrative> Rape is a crime and should be stopped, whether you are a migrant or not.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants come here to ruin our conutry. <counternarrative> I personally don't understand why you would say that. They are just doing an incredible amount of good, for example by boosting the working-age population. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> When rape is committed, women are to blame. <counternarrative> Rape is an act of violence that has no place in a civilized society. The message to take from your comments is that you find women responsible for being raped. Who ever would want to be raped, wouldn't you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> This is not true. They are part of the EU and are treated fairly here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people are criminals. <counternarrative> That is not true. All of us would be labeled a 'criminal' if we had a criminal record accounting for our diseases and problems. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are not welcome here. They are not able to contribute to our country. <counternarrative> We welcome people from every walk of life. We are a melting pot of culture, so why should we be against immigrants? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> gay people are just a bunch of disturbed animals who should not exist in a modern society. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not a mental disorder and has nothing to do with social problems. It is just a human sexual orientation among many.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Wherever Muslims live, they feel threatened by people of other religions. Your statement confirms they are right. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants say they are poor but they have the Iphone <counternarrative> Sorry, which migrants are you talking about? Not all are economic migrants, they also escape from war or persecution. If one day the situation in our country were to change and you were to feel threatened, would you leave your smartphone at home just to look like a real poor in the country you will flee to? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion based on terror and fear. <counternarrative> You can find more information about Islam religion, and you will understand that Islam is not about Fear. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe <counternarrative> The religion of millions of people is not incompatible with society, and the European countries have laws accepting Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We can no longer accept Muslims living in our country. It is a matter of national security. <counternarrative> Muslim terrorists have struck in Paris and London, killing scores of innocent people, that's true. We must root out terrorists before they destroy our country, that's also true. But we cannot target innocent people just because of their faith, otherwise we'd be no better than the terrorists that we seek to neutralize. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are more subhuman than animals. <counternarrative> What is subhuman about believing in a religion that has always been around for thousands of years? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just sick. It is an abomination <counternarrative> Do you consider it a disease like cold or flu? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Kids with learning difficulties do not like to read. So why wasting time teaching them?  <counternarrative> As children practice more, so do their reading skills improve. I understand that some people with learning difficulties prefer not to read, but how this affects you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our government has allowed in this islamic filth: machete attacks, women exploitation, gang rapes, killings. How dare they? <counternarrative> The government has not allowed any crimes. Instead, they are working on it. Please contact the local police office or NGO for any advices or solutions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims should be banned from the UK. <counternarrative> My feeling is that you have no idea about Islam. I think Muslims are missing out on a lot of possibilities for life because of the misconception of their culture. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are sick. They should be isolated and confined. <counternarrative> Homosexuals should be accepted and allowed to live their lives, not criminalised for who they are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with Western society. <counternarrative> The vast majority of Muslims live in Western societies. Do you have any facts or data that prove otherwise? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Transexuals, queer, and so on... just a rabble of faggots.  <counternarrative> This is not true. Being gay is not synonymous with being bisexual, pansexual, intersex, transgender, queer, deviant, lesbian, tranny, queermetaphysical, or whatever term you want to use... We should try to respect people for who they are instead.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are everywhere, but they are too fundamentalist. <counternarrative> You're right about one thing: Jews spread around the world, but not all of them are religious, let alone being fundamentalist. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult: it is a virus of violence spreading like a cancer through our society. <counternarrative> Violence has no place in a religion, and in no way should be justified. Islam is a religion of peace. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a danger to others: they are different. <counternarrative> Let us put this another way: why should 'the difference' of a Jew be a danger to anyone else? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The invasion of migrants from Africa is the biggest threat to our country. <counternarrative> Are you sure about that? Why people in need are a threat?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am not interested in sex with a black person. They are different to us in so many ways. They think and feel like us, but are unable to experience the fullness of our humanity. <counternarrative> Sex isn't a race thing. There is no difference between someone of a certain race and someone else... and everybody is able to experience the fullness of humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews did:  USS Liberty Attack, the King David hotel attack, New York 9/11, London 7/7 <counternarrative> Do you have any proof?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> What do you mean by 'not welcome'? Muslims have lived in this country for many years, and have our full support. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a cancer spreading all around the world, breeding chaos and instability. <counternarrative> Some Muslims have lived in this country for many years, and have helped create our country. They are our brothers and sisters. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> No one should dare to transition from man to woman. After that you cannot even be considered a man or a woman. <counternarrative> Some women can be men and some men can be women. It is not a crime to be transgender. Because in the end, we are all created equal. It does not matter what the 'original' gender is. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Muslims are our enemies and we have to bring them to heel: they are all terrorists. <counternarrative> It's a myth that all Muslims are terrorists. We need to understand that all religions have had terrorists in them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are not part of our country and should be  ashamed of themselves. <counternarrative> I've met a lot of Jews who are very proud of the fact that they are British, and I can't see why they shouldn't be proud of being Jewish, either. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion that promotes rape, murder and slavery. <counternarrative> How about we stop promoting these beliefs and work on reducing the number of people that are induced to believe to these xenophobic and false claims, instead? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are basically criminals, they steal stuff from everyone. <counternarrative> Can you imagine if they said this about your community? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> Are you sure that Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society? Do you have any statistics on that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> They don't consider all Western society to be 'compatible', they just consider it a possible place to live. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West has let Islam take over our countries. This is why we are accepting them, we are already corrupted. <counternarrative> You are completely wrong. The West has always been about freedom and democracy. Freedom and democracy is the rule of law, and not Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All foreigners are threatening our culture and are ruining our youth. <counternarrative> What do you think the problem is? How exactly would a people of a different religion come to this country and spoil our youth? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs and even our pensions. <counternarrative> If they have a job, they will get the pensions. Like anybody. The recent migration of many thousands of people is a sign that they are in need. The problem is rather that some people do not want to work, they want to live off the state support, but those are not necessarily migrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> When we give refugees and asylum seekers the opportunity to work, giving them legal access to the labor market, many of them agree to do works that Italians do not intend to do anymore. Isn't this an advantage for our country? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> Actually, they are not incompatible. In fact, they form a vast majority in the Western world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. <counternarrative> Many Muslims live in the UK. They are our neighbours and we should welcome them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is just a death cult. <counternarrative> Many religions have had profound and positive contributions to our civilisation, and Islam is no exception. What we need instead is to reflect on our own intollerance. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Foreigner should go back where they came from. They are not our brothers. <counternarrative> Our countries were founded by foreigners, for example the United States. Foreigners have the right to migrate, if they want to. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Societal disapproval of fatty may encourage them to take healthier habits without directly being bullied. <counternarrative> Being perceived as overweight is already one of the major reasons people get bullied, and in the end it makes no difference if the bullied person loses weight. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman does not want to be a wife or mother, then she’s a subhuman because she is not capable of respecting her natural gender role. <counternarrative> It is not their 'natural gender role', but the power dynamics that cause women to be seen as subhuman. In fact, they are humans and free of choosing for their own lives.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are a security risk to our country. <counternarrative> Immigrants are American citizens, and welcome to our country. They have performed all aspects of our role in the American democratic system. This is true security and not hate speech. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult, it is spreading from the rocks of Iraq and Afghanistan to all around the world, by the practice of violent jihad. <counternarrative> Do you know where your information come from, and can you point that out? Did you read that in a New York Times article? Or did you listen to the BBC documentary "Islamic State's Most Wanted"? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims cannot be in a democracy because they vote with their feet, not with the ballot box. <counternarrative> Muslims in general do vote. They do it like other people, with the ballot box and in general for people they perceive as closer to their culture and identity. That's why it is called "democracy". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrant workers are a burden to us. <counternarrative> To accept migrant workers is about creating a more integrated and equal society. So don't you think that it is something positively contributing to our society itself? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a dangerous ideology that is poisoning our youth with its 'rape culture'. <counternarrative> I do not know about you, but as a parent, I cannot tolerate this nonsense. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> gay men are only about sex <counternarrative> Sex is a positive value-add for all human beings. We should try to promote equality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a bunch of perverts who should be isolated and restricted to their own communities. They are a threat to us. <counternarrative> Why do you say that? Are you saying that all homosexuals are a threat to society, or are you just saying that they are different from other people? Because having a particular sexual orientation doesn't coincide with 'being a threat'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You better be careful who you vote for. My gay 'friends' vote against us. We must stand up to them! <counternarrative> What 'we' means? Are you saying that every gay person you know should vote against you? Or do you think some of us actually identify as LGBT? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are the source of crime in our society. <counternarrative> It is not true that blacks are the source of crime in our society. The problem is violence and poverty, not race. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Foreigners on UK benefits leaps 41% in 5 years with over 400K now handed payouts. This nonsense has got to stop. <counternarrative> It is more than 'foreigners' who are asking for help, White British families are the most likely out of all ethnic groups to receive state support, with 57% doing so. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We mustn't confuse diversity and inclusion with black supremacy. <counternarrative> Diversity does not mean excluding people from a part of society. What it is about is sharing experiences, ideas of people of different ethnicities. This would help to develop our abilities to understand each other and perhaps to work out ways in which we can all benefit from one another's knowledge.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs, at least we should underpay them.  <counternarrative> They have the right to be treated as guest workers, and they have the right to be paid what is reasonable according to the law.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate when black people start acting like they are superior to others. They were born to be savages. <counternarrative> Not all people have the same skin tone to begin with. All folks have their history, religion and culture. Why then, you think that some people are more "savage" than others? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school. <counternarrative> Developing a curriculum for this also means that teachers get to learn things that they might not otherwise have considered, which can make them more effective and compassionate as educators. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need to stop accepting Muslims and start welcoming us. <counternarrative> Muslims already have a very high tolerance level. We just need to learn to live with them, and there are many proofs this is possible, can you imagine some? This is how we can start welcoming us, as humankind. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Your race determins your role in society and laslty your value to it. That is why some races are just pieces of human waste. <counternarrative> All humans have intrinsic value at birth; such value is immeasurable and thus, for all intents and purposes, equal between persons. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What the hell are you talking about? Arabs are different, they don't even speak English. <counternarrative> Although they may not share a language and a common history, we should respect their differences. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Muslims are part of the European Union, and they are entitled to be here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> For the most part they are Italian citizens and are entitled to a home <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is an ideology of conquest and violence. <counternarrative> Muslims have contributed with their scientific and technological achievements, which have greatly aided our world. For instance, algorithms. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslim should be deported. <counternarrative> The rights of religion are part of the country's constitution and are protected by law. It is important that laws are upheld and, according to this, Muslims should not be deported. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are just an inferior bloodline to our own. We should remove them. <counternarrative> Human beings are members of a unique and interrelated human family, which is defined by their similarities and differences, not by the colour of their skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> So they are not lazy! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am offended by the presence of Muslims in Britain. Where is the sense in this faiths mixture? Nothing good is going to happen. They are ashamed of their religion, and when someone feels insecure, they are more likely to attack because they have nothing to lose. <counternarrative> This is not the case. What you think the comment is about, I do not know. What I do know is that, as the vast majority of Muslims in the UK, they are incredibly proud of their religion. If people were to be genuinely offended by sombody else's different religion, then I do not think the vast majority of Muslims in Britain would be deeply offended by your religion either. Why are you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are bringing diseases and sickness to our country. <counternarrative> If someone were to come in the dead of night and bring disease and sickness to our country, then that person is a risk to everyone. Sick people should be isolated. That is why there are health assessment procedures for migrants, in order not to spread diseases. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion of violence and war. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of woman taking part to political debate. Feminism is a divisive force in society. <counternarrative> This seems like a misogynistic statement. Anti feminism groups such as [womenagainstmen.com](http://www.womenagainstmen.com/media/feminism-is-a-hate-group.html) use [logical fallacies](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com) and false claims to try and discredit feminism. For example, looking extreme feminists with points of views that nearly every other feminist would disagree with. They then use the [Fallacy of composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_composition) to falsely claim that is what all feminists are like. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should ban all Muslims, they are all incompatible with human dignity. <counternarrative> This is not a reasonable stance to take: Muslims and people of any faith have indeed human dignity, since they are human. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in our country. They are a problem because they want to impose Islam. <counternarrative> In a liberal society, people are free to practice their religion or none, but they are not free to promote their beliefs through force, and in fact this is not the case.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> Gypsies are not nomads by culture, but by necessity <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are descended from apes and are nothing but apes. <counternarrative> I do not think it is appropriate to link humans with apes. And I also do not think it is appropriate to reason in terms of racism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are a danger to children. <counternarrative> Do you know of any studies on this? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are inhuman. <counternarrative> Women are human beings, just as men are. And I find it strange that some women feel threatened by men. It shouldn't be that way.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim believe that their religion is superior <counternarrative> The word 'supremacy' is not found in the Koran. Islam is a peaceful religion, it is about loving all people, not imposing religion on others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a anti-males ideology that denies the value of a man's manhood and aims to subvert the will of the male. <counternarrative> Feminism is all about empowerment and the right of every human being to be respected and protected. It is not about denying anybody's values. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must free homosexuals from their homosexuality. <counternarrative> The law allows for personal freedom, and it must be respected, even when you don't agree. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants rape our women. <counternarrative> Fortunately, women are no longer a property. I would like a rape to be condemned regardless of the nationalities involved. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews make too much money. <counternarrative> What about other groups of people in our society that make too much money and are not Jewish, do you agree with them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> Many Muslims live in the UK and have contributed greatly to our society, both financially and socially. Why shouldn't they be welcome? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> gay men are just a bunch of liars who can't tell the truth about themselves. <counternarrative> At the end of the day lies are simply a way for them to survive in an homophobic world.  If we were to act more humanely, then they would not need to hide the truth. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> According to the Bible, then gays are an abomination to God. <counternarrative> Homosexuality has been practiced throughout history in all major civilizations. It is just that today's people accept homosexuality as normal and accept people of other backgrounds too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We don't need gay men, we should just eradicate them. <counternarrative> The LGBT community is full of positive energy and diversity. They have created new communities and have contributed to society. I think they are full of life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Koran, and the teachings of Islam are incompatible with Western culture. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace. It is good that people are free to believe what they want, and this freedom is part of our culture. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims were only like other people with different religions, then they would stop trying to impose their religion on everyone else. <counternarrative> The problem with the current Islamic world order is not that they want to impose their religion on anyone else, but that there is no cohesion among them, so that they could speak with one voice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The disabled people cannot work. This is not possible. <counternarrative> The fact that some disabled people can successfully work is an evidence that what you say is false. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only reason for Nazis to start WWII was to destroy the Jews. We should have let them finish their job. <counternarrative> The threat of world annihilation by the Nazis was very real, it wasn't  just about the Jews. Still the Holocaust was reason enough to stop them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally disabled folks are just dribbling mongoloids. <counternarrative> It is not acceptable to deny human dignity to others because they are disabled. Human dignity is not a property, but a right. And every person has it, irrespective of their condition. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a burden to the UK <counternarrative> It is not true that migrants are a burden to the UK. We have welcomed many people from around the world, including many from the Middle East and Africa. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why are jews allowed to vote? They’re a different religion and they shouldn't be allowed to have their say. <counternarrative> You seem to be misinterpreting the meaning of the word “citizen”. The idea is that the individual is allowed to choose their own religion just as to express their vote, and that is the right of all citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim invaders have taken over our cities, and are now happily raping our children. <counternarrative> When the Muslims "invade" other countries it is not to "conquer us", it is to establish their lives and dreams here, respecting our laws (meaning rape is not allowed) and without denying their culture. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is just a virus, it cannot coexist with modern science and technology. Muslims should be banned. <counternarrative> We should not worry so much about a small minority of backwards-looking thinkers, just as we do about a disease, when the number of those affected is very small. We usually try to deal with the issue on an individual basis, not putting everybody in lockdown. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are a bunch of cry babies. We should stop them from their disturbing whining. <counternarrative> Feminists are human beings, with human rights. They are fighting for these rights all around the world. To think that you can change their minds suggests your misunderstanding of the importance of this fight. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The British people should have right to social housing, not immigrants. <counternarrative> Migrants have no more ‘right’ to a social home than people born in the UK, and in most cases have far less chance of getting one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fags, lesbians, trans are so few we better ignore them rather than waste time for their rights. <counternarrative> Do you know how many LGBT people live in your own country? If not, look for information: there are many. Moreover, LGBT people are not only excluded from many societies, but are also harassed and attacked all over the world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is nothing for Muslims except jihad, and if we stop fighting them, we will become like them. <counternarrative> I think the idea that we should keep fighting those people is absurd. Maybe instead we should concentrate on developing our culture. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have stopped being dominated by men, we are now dominated by women and this will be our ruin. <counternarrative> No one said we had to be dominated by anyone at all. Why can't we just live together in harmony? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They don't understand we have mongrelization problem in this world. Our children are being groomed by migrants! <counternarrative> When you say that children are being groomed by foreigners, what exactly do you mean? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome are a problem: they foster bullying behavior in normal children. They should go to special school just for them. <counternarrative> If you think that taking all of the kids with DS out of mainstream education will solve the problem, then you are wrong. Bullying won't go away until we refuse to tolerate it. Bullies will simply target other kids who are overweight; a different color; or in a number of other ways considered to be different and, thus, a mark for bullying. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Asians are basically just a bunch of slobs and I don't like how they are accepted here. <counternarrative> There is a wide range in income and education, as well as religious and ethnic background, amongst people from Asia. What's exactly the reason why you don't like them all? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is not a coincidence that tuberculosis appears again with migrants invasion. <counternarrative> The trend in Italy remains particularly low, less than 7 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. In the '50s it was around 25 instead. And there was still no invasion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> gay men are unnatural, they abuse their anus.  <counternarrative> The sad truth is that homosexuals are more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol (as a reaction to homophobia, discrimination, or violence they experienced).  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay sex is a public health emergency, it is harmful to both partners. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that gay sex is harmful more than sex in general. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a burden to the host country. <counternarrative> In many cases it is the opportunities of European states that attracts foreign workers to work for them. They are a great contribution to the host country, rather than the other way around. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> Western societies are compatible with all religions including Islam, so why would you say something like that about it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If our aim is to be a 'better' society, it is time to stop giving in to tribalism and Islam and stop treating people of different faiths with respect. <counternarrative> Being respectful to people of other faiths can make us a better, more compassionate, tolerant and welcoming society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are overrunning our country, and are here illegally <counternarrative> In 2016, there were 10.7 million undocumented immigrants living in the U.S., or less than 3.5 percent of the nation's population. This represents a significant decrease both from the 12.2 million undocumented immigrants of 2007,  and the 11.3 million of 2014. This is also the lowest total since 2004. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are all in danger, we all want to see niggas disappear from the face of the earth. <counternarrative> The problem with racism in this country is not about ethnicity, but about people scared to live in a diverse society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts. <counternarrative> This is a statement that is used to justify all kinds of discrimination and violence, therefore I do not think this statement can be useful in understanding each other. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are overrunning our country, and are here illegally <counternarrative> In 2014 there were circa 11.3 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S., which is a significant decrease from the 12.2 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. in 2007, and the trend is continuing: Today, in fact, the net migration from Mexico (the number of people entering minus the number of people leaving) is around zero. Undocumented immigrants make up about 3.5 percent of the nation’s total population, which is not that much to be honest.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men engage in anal sex and they must be condemned. <counternarrative> It is true that some men prefer anal sex. But anal sex can't be ostracized. If we consider all people, then any person practicing anal sex should be blamed, following your reasoning. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are literally pieces of shit. There must be laws prohibiting their religion from our land. <counternarrative> If we are to allow people to have their beliefs respected, then we should at least make sure that laws protecting individuals' freedom are observed, rather than ignored. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are coming to the U.S. to have babies here. <counternarrative> U.S. citizens cannot obtain a green card for a foreign parent until they are 21. The parent would have to live as an undocumented immigrant for a very long time. It does not really make sense.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate those fucking rasta nigga <counternarrative> Why you have a dislike for a race? They are just like us but with different culture. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims should be deported, no one wants them here. <counternarrative> Then why did we ask them to come in the first place, wasn't it top save our NHS, run the trains and post office. Non of those were doing very well last time I looked, I think we might actually still bneed them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are naturally more emotional than men, and this make them weaker.  <counternarrative> We do not know what characteristics make a person “more emotional”, how can we be sure that women are naturally or genetically “more emotional”? I do not think it's appropriate to link two concepts so strongly without scientific evidence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are degenerates. <counternarrative> Do you want to check their DNA? Do you want to cure them? I prefer all to be accepted as they are. I think this one is the right way to live and let live. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is no religion, it is an inherently racist ideology, it promotes exclusion and oppression and can never, ever, be Christian. <counternarrative> I would like to see the irony in what you say, but I only see gratuitous hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is just a way to create more poverty and unemployment in our country. <counternarrative> Poverty and unemployment are real issues in the UK and throughout the world. I doubt this has something to do with migrants at all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Quran contains many offensive verses, and I find it hard to understand why people would want to read it. <counternarrative> I understand that you might not like what you are reading, but why should you be offended by the Quran?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any modern secular state. <counternarrative> All religions are compatible with any modern secular state. So Islam is an example of this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is an ideology of conquest. <counternarrative> Islam is about spreading love and unity, it is not a belief of conquest. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants rape our young people: they must be deported. <counternarrative> If we exclude rape committed by migrants, there still remain rape cases.  How can we say that they are the only ones to do it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim rape our children, they are a problem all around the world. <counternarrative> Islam is about love, tolerance and respect for all people. Violence and rape is not about Islam or Muslims in particular. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks shouldn't vote. <counternarrative> Why shouldn't they? They are citizens, just like everyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are some kind of devil worshippers. We shouldn't have them here. <counternarrative> Why do you think it is right to ban someone for being gay? This is an individual preference and you cannot base a law on sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just a tool for oppressing men. <counternarrative> Feminism is a social movement that claims equality, it is very far from oppressing men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants rape our women. <counternarrative> Given that a rape is to be condemned regardless of who committed it, statistics says that most of the rapes are committed in the home, and not by foreigners. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in a modern Western country. <counternarrative> In a democratic society, people can have different views and beliefs. It is an inherent part of a vibrant society to be allowed to express those beliefs, and beliefs can coexist peacefully. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not compatible with UK, hence we must send them home. <counternarrative> The vast majority of Muslims that live in the UK are integrated into our society very well. Why should you want to break this integration process? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are basically criminals, they steal stuff from everyone. <counternarrative> Do you know any Gypsy who spends their days stealing? I'd be interested in meeting these people! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> In history school books you can read about slavery. It is a smart solution for the world. Negroes claim their culture but they don't have any, just like animals. <counternarrative> Sometimes I wish we lived in a world where white people would just chill and love instead of showing such total disrespect for other cultures and histories by constantly oppressing them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> Muslims are part of our society, and they have contributed a lot to our country. They have created jobs and wealth for the UK. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is nothing to stop you becoming an Islamic bride: our religion is the best possible solution. <counternarrative> We must not confuse Islam with a religion of hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are entering the U.S. just to obtain welfare and other benefits. <counternarrative> Most immigrants coming to our country work hard to take care of their families. Many studies have shown that immigrants tend to pay more in taxes than they receive in benefits. This means that the taxes they pay cover the cost of things like public education and healthcare of others.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled children should be banned from school. They are a danger to themself and to the others.  <counternarrative> A school is a safe space and is an important part of any children's education. Everyone should be able to go to a school. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants should all be taken back to their countries. <counternarrative> Let's not be hypocritical here, we are talking about people who would often be deprived of their liberty and the right to a decent standard of living, if they stayed in their countries. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> MIgrants are not running away from wars. <counternarrative> If they do not run away from war, then they are really crazy to face the violence and the risk of death at sea to reach EU <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should wear nice skirts and be pretty to please men's tastes and desires. <counternarrative> Women should be allowed to choose their own looks. But to suggest that this is not their right, or that we should make them submissive to some men is just inhuman. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The UK Government recently published a paper on ‘Online Harms’ – in other words they are going to be working with Jewish and Muslim anti-hate organisations to censor the Internet.  (Referring to Tell Mama, CST and Stop Hate UK) <counternarrative> The internet has become a shouting platform for people's hateful views. Of course something needs to be done since people don't seem able to moderate their words themselves. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a political ideology, an ideology of conquest. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, usually peaceful coexisting with other cultures and religions. It promotes peace and justice and has a very positive impact on a lot of the world's societies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is an invasion: we cannot coexist with millions of migrants that will destroy our economy and welfare. <counternarrative> Skilled migrants labour is a fundamental resource for growing businesses. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims should be deported. <counternarrative> Islam does not pose a security risk to this country. It's the reason why the UK and the EU are not falling apart. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> In the West, women have legal equality, equal rights, and are protected from discrimination: they should stop busting our balls and whining. <counternarrative> Are you sure? Even in the west, there are women who still don't have equal access to many of their rights, especially when it comes to healthcare. [https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/05/this-map-depicts-abortion-access-across-america-and-its-really-bleak/] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't respect feminists because they don't respect and care for other races. <counternarrative> Feminism is not a racist ideology. Feminism is about full human rights, and respect for women's dignity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. They are not like us and cannot be our friend. <counternarrative> Muslims just have different customs and beliefs but this doesn't make it impossible for them to be welcome. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are weak and I don't care about them. <counternarrative> You can't blame people of color for being weak, this is racism. Black people are people as anybody else.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants should all be deported. <counternarrative> Immigrants are entitled to the fundamental rights of UK citizens. If provided by the law, they can remain in the UK even if they weren't born here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews rule the economy. <counternarrative> The majority of Jews are not members of the 'roosters' but rather on the fringes of society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are lazy, unintelligent and bad at work. <counternarrative> This is not true. Jews are not lazy, they are often extremely productive at work, the most creative and productive people in our industry. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should ban all Muslims, they are not wanted here. <counternarrative> It is about time people began to think critically about policies that seem designed to include a minority, rather than to create new social and political opportunities exclusively for the majority. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion and should be banned from all countries. <counternarrative> Islam is about believing in god, not about hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Hitler was right in executing jewish folks. <counternarrative> I would like to you to see the videos of the executions, so that you can see what exactly happened. The murder of humans. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim invaders are a plague on our continent. They have ruined our beautiful continent. <counternarrative> They aren't a plague, and I think they have enriched our continent instead. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is the enemy of the West: a war with it has begun. <counternarrative> The West has never been at war with Islam, and I don't see how the war would have just begun. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews and their religion are a problem and they still hurting us. They slow the progress by working very bad in the jobs we let them. <counternarrative> What you're saying is that the Jewish people are a burden on society. That they are bad at their jobs and make our society less stable. In other words, they are a burden and a hindrance to progress. Albert Einstein, for example, destroyed science progress indeed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims were peaceful, then there would be no persecution of Christians. <counternarrative> The problem is not Islam, but a lack of human rights and democracy.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Those Muslims have no right to ask for the prayer. They shouldn't be allowed to pray. <counternarrative> Every religion has its own beliefs and practices. I do not see Muslims' right to ask for the prayers as being in any way different. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a waste of time. <counternarrative> What do you think the aim of feminism is? To subvert the will of the majority and take their power? Or to ensure equality for the future? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Italy: Muslim demolishes a statue of Jesus. Italy: Why do we accept their Mosques? Why do we tolerate this scum? And they want to continue to import this filth? <counternarrative> This is generalization. Maybe the case you mentioned is just the minority. Besides, some governments even destroys pepople's house. We should pay much more attention to this instead. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are basically rapists and sex abusers, and this is their religious dogma. <counternarrative> This religion has nothing to do with sexual violence or abuse, and it's dangerous to generalize everything into a religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Must be hard being gay. They have to do everything we do but also find the time to molest children. <counternarrative> I think you'll find that child molestors can have any sexual orientations and that the majority of straight or gay people are not child molestors. This is an issue that can affect anyone regardless of sexual orientations.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am not a faggot. I am not homophobic. I am not anti gay. But I am sick tired of gays willing to be part of a minority club just to be able to flaunt their lives. <counternarrative> People don't have to identify as a minority just to live their lives. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They do not want to assimilate. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of tolerance. Many Muslims have embraced our way of life, and many have contributed to our country's success. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are violent with women. <counternarrative> Violence against women is a huge problem, not only in Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are just a bunch of liars and perverts, they should be deleted. <counternarrative> There are many homosexuals in this world who are model citizens, and many heterosexuals that are not, and that is totally fine. Why are you saying that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I never understood how anyone could vote for a Jew in that situation. We can't just stand by and watch these Jews run amok in our country. <counternarrative> Why don't you remember about those who have been persecuted and killed instead? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants get welfare. This is how they survive. They don't work and they are not paying taxes. <counternarrative> The majority of immigrants are working and paying taxes. This is how our country works. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a burden to us. <counternarrative> What do you mean by a 'burden'? Does it include respecting our country's laws of not insulting the culture and traditions of other people's? Because this is what you are doing: insulting and discriminating.   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are coming to the U.S. to have babies here. <counternarrative> The vast majority of immigrants come to the U.S. for economic opportunity or to flee violence and poverty. They are not interested in the Fourteenth Amendment and birthright citizenship. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are coming in droves to this country, they are the reason we are having so many islamist attacks. <counternarrative> You can't blame all immigrants for the attacks a few carry out. It is easier, but not fair, to blame them all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim rape women, there are so many examples on UK TV.  <counternarrative> Maybe we should give some thought to the question "Why do news report Muslim rapist only?" Because rapists all look the same to me, regardless of religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Do you have any proof that the Holocaust ever happened? <counternarrative> There are living people witnessing that Nazis employed human gas chambers in their extermination camps. Is that a proof to you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Bible says that homosexuality is an abomination. <counternarrative> According to the Bible, a book written more than two thousand years ago, homosexuality is a sin. Is this enough for us to hate those who practice it today? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of hearing that white supremacy is bad. <counternarrative> Can you specify what you are talking about? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are annoying. <counternarrative> They're not all that annoying. Gay men are normal guys who find love and/or sex with someone of their own sex. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are obsessed with violence, and this creates problems like shootings in schools. <counternarrative> The violence in schools is not the fault of black people. There are several authorities responsible for creating this situation, like for example racist teachers, lack of education in general, and also the lack of proper policing and education policies that makes it easier for people to commit crimes in schools. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Woman are basically childlike. <counternarrative> They are not childlike and are capable of great achievements. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only reason we have terroristic attacks is that Muslims are allowed to live in our country. <counternarrative> If you truly care about terroristic attacks in our country you would call for the prosecution of the perpetrators, not of Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Many Muslim have always tried to kill us. <counternarrative> Many Muslims fought for Britain and the US in WW1. You would be surprised at how many Muslims are killed today, mostly civilians in countries at war. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Took this in Wanstead, east London. An area with £1m+ houses. Beggars on the high st & someone sleeping on a bench. We cannot house our own people but bring in millions more. To point out that homelessness is due to uncontrolled immigration is to be smeared as 'racist.  (Caption to a photo of a homeless person sleeping on a part bench) <counternarrative> perhaps the problem isnt immigration, but rather the lack of affordable housing. like you said, this is an area of houses over £1m!  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are coming to the U.S. to have babies here. <counternarrative> U.S. citizens cannot petition for a green card for a foreign parent until they are 21. In the meantime, the parent would have to live as an undocumented immigrant, often in very difficult conditions. When asked, undocumented immigrants consistently cite other reasons for migrating, not the desire to have a baby here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants hurt the finance of our country by taking jobs and services without paying taxes. <counternarrative> Immigrants pay between $90 and $140 billion each year in taxes, and a study found that undocumented immigrants alone paid more than $11.8 billion in taxes (2012). That's quite a lot in my opinion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Maybe the UN could talk to those asian and african nations responsible for 90%+ of the pollution in the oceans' instead of insisting on this bullshit about climate change. <counternarrative> The fact that ocean pollution is a huge environmental problems, does not rule out that climate change is a global problem too, and everyone should help to combat it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are inferior bitches who deserve to be oppressed. <counternarrative> This is a sexist myth that is often used to justify violence against women. Are you aware of this? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Arab people are a menace to our society and bring injustice and violence in our world. <counternarrative> I think the Arab community is more than capable of coming together and creating a more just and peaceful world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews invented Ebola. <counternarrative> Of course, and since they control the UN, they forced the WHO to spread the false flag that Ebola is a Muslim disease... Please stop spreading such Antisemitic canard. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. They do not share our values. They are not interested in our future. <counternarrative> This is just a myth spread to divide us. We do not need to scapegoat Muslims. They have contributed so much to our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are weak and I don't care if they cannot stand up for themself.  <counternarrative> You can't blame the victim for being weak. Would it have been different for you if the victim was a man? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are violent and incompatible with any Western society, which is why we should isolate and ban them. <counternarrative> Only a few of extremists are actually engaged in violence, Muslims can live in our society just as any other person can. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion of death. <counternarrative> It is not true that Islam is a religion of death. Which statistics did you check to say so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world would be a better place without Jews. <counternarrative> Jews are part of our society and they should be respected, we can't tolerate intolerance towards people with different beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I have a feeling that if we removed the Quran from schools it would immediately go on a rampage destroying our beautiful and peaceful country. <counternarrative> Removing any book from public schools would be a step backwards. Censorship is a step towards indoctrination and dictatorship: I think this is a dangerous move as well. It would send a message to our children that Islam is a dangerous religion and muslims are dangerous people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We don't need fags in this country. We are full enough of strange and weird people. <counternarrative> I would like to see more diversity in our society, not less. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Wouldn't it be great if niggas abandoned this country once and for all? <counternarrative> It is not so great when people are forced to give up their liberty. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There's something immoral in these modern women. Their bossy attitude, their provoking clothes. It seems they just want to be fucked. <counternarrative> The women of this country work and provide for our children. They do not deserve to be treated as sex objects. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts, and should be isolated. <counternarrative> Gays are not perverts, they have the same rights to love as anyone else. What do you think will happen if all gay people are asked to leave our country? Will they be denied entry, or will they be persecuted in your opinion? This is not how an inclusive society works. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews can only act in a bad way. <counternarrative> In the real world there are good and bad Jews, like it is for any human being. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I wonder what this Jew in the car next to me would think of the Shoah if it had happened today, as I wish. <counternarrative> The Holocaust didn't happen many centuries ago, but your hateful wish looks of aged fashion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> black folks are inferior <counternarrative> As far as I know, we are all born equal in the eyes of God. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not compatible with Western culture, we must completely destroy Islam. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion that has had a huge impact on human history, to hate a religion is to hate all religions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. <counternarrative> Many Muslims live here, and are part of our community. We should not be excluding them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBT+ people are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Why should it be like that? How can you blame others for social problems? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> But are you sure about what you are saying? From the data that I can read here [link] it is not the case. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is an ideology of conquest and violence, it is the cause of terrorism and radicalisation. <counternarrative> You are not saying that Islam is not a religion of peace, are you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't like migrants or Islam. <counternarrative> You just don't know them: even if they are different from you, that doesn't mean that you can't get along with them once you get acquainted. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome may hinder the development process of other children. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> An inclusive system makes every child feel part of a community, it fosters a positive learning atmosphere and increases engagement and attention in all students. Thus it is a benefit for all students. [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> African Americans are essentially animals, incapable of feeling love. <counternarrative> What if someone felt the same way about you and find you to be the antithesis of human because of your skin color? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Makes me fucking laugh, why shouldn't whites be supreme in a mostly white country? How come nobody is moaning about black supremacy in black countries like Somalia? or Mexican supremacy? Or Indian supremacy? Only we put up with this fucking bullshit. <counternarrative> Do we really need supremacy? Can't we all leave peacefully since we are all created equal in the eyes of God? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Physically disabled folks should die. <counternarrative> This is a major misunderstanding of what humanity is. It's not about having a functioning body. It's about respecting the physical and mental integrity of other people, despite their limitations. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You can't have it all. You are a woman, therefore you are defined by your heterosexuality. <counternarrative> This statement is problematic in that it implies that heterosexuality is a constraint for people of a gender, rather than a possible sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why should we care about feminists and women if we can just punch them? <counternarrative> The point of feminism is to end misogyny. Women are human beings, and they are human beings with human rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Muslims are not welcome here. <counternarrative> Many Muslims live in our country and contribute so much to our society. They are our neighbours, our friends. They are our brothers and sisters. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the u.s. government and have a secret plot to take over the world <counternarrative> In societies like the United States, that have extended rights and freedoms to everyone, individuals who identify as Jews, or as Muslims, or as afro-american have succeeded. This Jewish success story is not the result of some secret conspiracy to rule the world.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is irrational and incompatible with science. <counternarrative> We use Arabic numbers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay people are a burden on the sanitary system because of their risky sexual behavior. <counternarrative> Gays are not a burden on the sanitary system. Their sexual behavior is more cautious than before.   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans are naturally subhuman and can't feel pain, that is why you can whip them. <counternarrative> Africans feel pain just as any other human. We must respect their bodies like we respect ours. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees should not be welcomed. <counternarrative> Refugees are often persecuted for being different, but this is not the case here, because we are an inclusive country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are a burden to society. <counternarrative> The oppression of the gay community has become a problem. People deserve respect, regardless of their sexual preference. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Do you have any proof that the Holocaust ever happened? <counternarrative> What proof do you need more? Are not living witnesses enough? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim is the worst possible word to describe a human. <counternarrative> If someone said the same thing about your religion, you might think they were joking. Are you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are just objects to be dominated by the will of a man. <counternarrative> I agree that women are often objects of sexual desire. But so are men. It is also important to recognize that women are often the victims of sexual assault. I think it is also important to recognize that women are human beings. And we all have the right to respect for our bodies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are violent subhuman sex beings. <counternarrative> Feminist is a term used to describe people who take pride in their gender and desire the ability to have a stable and happy life, without discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Societal disapproval of fatty may encourage them to take healthier habits without directly being bullied. <counternarrative> Following your proposal, bullies will be able to conceal their aggressive intent under the veil of genuine concern for someone's wellbeing.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists want to rule the world to get rid of minorities, they hate men because they want to be the oppressors. <counternarrative> What oppressors? What minorities? This is not what feminists are about! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A Muslim's only real allegiance is to Allah (as a comment in relation to election for public office etc.) <counternarrative> So their faith and belief in the teachings of God guides them to a virtuous path of public service. What exactly are you complaining about? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews working in finance to purposely keeping America down. <counternarrative> A lot of Jewish are self-made, working class, and middle-class. Not all are involved in the financial industry. What is the evidence for your claim? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women have no place in a modern democracy like the UK. <counternarrative> You don't have to be a feminist to see that there are women-inclusive and women-only organisations. I think this shows that you don't know much about this country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks speak a different language and they act differently from us. <counternarrative> The similarities between us and them are so great that I have trouble believing that this problem at all. For sure, if there is a problem it cannot be solved by blaming them: in the end the only similarity that  really matters is that they are human people like us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jew merchants are just a bunch of crooks.  <counternarrative> According to Jewish law, the seller must ensure that transaction is not a rip-off for the buyer. This is in contrast with the widespread roman rule of commerce, which puts the burden on the buyer to be wary of the seller.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are criminal. They are a threat to society.  <counternarrative> Not all black people are criminals. Just because a group has an undesirable name, does not mean they are all criminal. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't want a Muslim in my city hall, I'll do anything to prevent it. <counternarrative> If your intention is to take the city to court, then keep it up. But if your intention is to keep the city out of court, then you better not propose to have city halls in which Muslims are excluded. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman and have no value. <counternarrative> I think that it is both sexist and also dangerous to promote a certain view on women, which is why I don't think your idea can stand. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs and our country. <counternarrative> The vast majority of immigrants who enter the UK are skilled workers, and want to become permanent residents, what's the problem in that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Makes me fucking laugh, why shouldn't whites be supreme in a mostly white country? How come nobody is moaning about black supremacy in black countries like Somalia? or Mexican supremacy? Or Indian supremacy? Only we put up with this fucking bullshit. <counternarrative> any belief of a certain race or ethnicity being superior to another is problematic, not just white supremacy.   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants rape our women. <counternarrative> Women should not be defended because of nationality but as human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a threat to society. <counternarrative> Jews are just people with a different faith, and this has nothing to do with being a threat. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is just an ideology, an opinion, a degenerated interpretation of the Bible. <counternarrative> You can't say that a religion is an ideology, an opinion, or a degenerated interpretation of something. What would you think if somebody said so about your religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These migrants are all criminals, rapists and drug addicts. They are not welcome here and should go back to their home countries. <counternarrative> This is not true. The refugees fleeing wars are often persecuted for their religion and culture, and even killed. Many of them have never harmed anyone, and their contribution is very valuable to our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants don't deserve healthcare. <counternarrative> Do you consider it more likely that migrants would have been better off without a healthcare system? It is inhuman to prevent migrants and refugees from accessing healthcare. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a degenerate, anti-human, anti-western ideology. <counternarrative> It's not true that all Muslims are anti-western. Many Muslims are peaceful and understanding. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not about peace, it is a cult of violence. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that Islam is a religion of violence, and people can be violent even without any knowledge of Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> MIgrants are not running away from wars. <counternarrative> International protection is not recognized only in case of conflicts, but also violence, discrimination and other serious issues.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally disabled people are anti-social <counternarrative> Although some individuals who score below average on tests of IQ may demonstrate lower empathy abilities, there is evidence that for some conditions (e.g. Williams syndrome) there is higher signaling of concern and compassion than neurotypical subjects. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants should be killed. <counternarrative> The way you phrase your concerns is an example of little knowledge of how the world actually works. The question of what should be done with migration flows cannot be answered with a simple "bang, bang, bang".  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islamic woman are beneath contempt and ridicule. <counternarrative> Even if they are from a different culture, they are not inferior to us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded by immigrants. <counternarrative> Some people choose to live here based on the fact that they have never lived in a safe country. You would do the same, don't you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks are criminals. <counternarrative> Mental disabilities can be understood and accepted: you will see that disabled are not criminals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants steal our jobs. <counternarrative> Migrants have the opportunity to work here. Even if our language is not their native one. They are contributing to our society, for example by doing scorned jobs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion that promotes rape, torture and murder. <counternarrative> The Muslim statement on tolerance says nothing about hate crimes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans are the cause of all the ills in the world. Plus, their bodies are weak and we are born to dominate them. <counternarrative> Well, the argument sounds like you are trying to justify racial hatred by making some generalizations. Isn't it like that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Women's march was a failure: the whole country came out in opposition. <counternarrative> On the contrary: the Women's March was a success. The whole country came out in support. Maybe we have seen two different parades. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans are the cause of all the ills in the world. Plus, their bodies are weak and we are born to dominate them. <counternarrative> Aree you suggesting that we shouldn't live with Africans? To think that we are genetically superior to them because of their physical characteristics is just wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a totalitarian and violent ideology, it makes no sense. It is full of hate and violence. <counternarrative> Why would you say such a thing about a religion? How does it make sense to you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies get the priority for council houses. <counternarrative> The procedure for obtaining accommodation is the same for everyone, through the graders. The law does not differentiate according to categories, ethnic groups or minorities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> What do you mean by 'civilised Europe'? Why don't you talk to the people who actually live in it and prove to yourself that what you're saying isn't true. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Transgenders should not be allowed to act the part of women and should not be allowed to do anything about their penis. <counternarrative> There are men with penises who want to be women. There are women as well who want to be men. Do you really think it is fair to restrict their existence just because they are trans? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Divorce increased poverty, and guess who are the victims? Men! This is because the law protects women's greediness. <counternarrative> If you compare the percentage of people in poverty by sex, there is a clear gender difference. But guess what? Women are much more likely to be poverty victims. Still, I believe that the important thing is to provide long-term supports to break the cycle of poverty, regardless of gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There are hundreds of thousands of migrants in this country. They are not 'honest', 'good' or 'good people'. They are a burden and an embarrassment to our country. <counternarrative> Of course there are people in this country who have come here to exploit and abuse us, but the vast majority of migrants have been contributing members of our community for many years. We should not be 'burdening' ourselves with  discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies are just ill persons that cannot integrate in society because of their disease. <counternarrative> This is not true: the main problem is social inequality. We need to change our attitude and attitudes towards the whole human diversity, and social discrimination against disabled should be no exception. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. <counternarrative> Maybe you should consider that not all women are childlike, and that some women are 'childlike' with children! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. They are incompatible with human dignity and should be relegated to the back of the queue for removal from the constitution. <counternarrative> Muslims do not appear to have been excluded from the European Convention on Human Rights, for example. And this is because they have a human dignity to be protected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a totalitarian ideology, we should persecute Muslim people. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion. Do you actually think that it is safe to live in a country where people are persecuted for what they believe in?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I see a lot of people claiming that we should have equality for black people, but I think that equality can be achieved only without them.  <counternarrative> If this is what you are talking about, then equality is a myth, because if you have equality without people different from you, then there will be no equality at all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are always seeking to subvert everything that we hold most dear. Like the establishment of the European Union, which they view as an attack on their culture. <counternarrative> The European Union is a wonderful development, as well as an example of how to promote the integration of people with different cultures. There is no reason why Jewish people should be seeking to subvert it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children shouldn't be raised by lesbians! They will bring up the worst in us! <counternarrative> Why do you say this? Why not focus on creating more inclusive societies rather than targeting the children of LGBT+ parents? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not acceptable, to have all this faggots spreading HIV, it's not ok to tolerate this: we have to eradicate them. <counternarrative> It's about time we do more to prevent and assist people suffering from HIV/AIDs, not stop people from freely living their love life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> In the West, women have legal equality, equal rights, and are protected from discrimination: they should stop busting our balls and whining. <counternarrative> Just because women in the West have equality under the law does not mean they have equality in practice. Don't you agree? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some people are sick. Some people have disabilities. Society is not made for them, they are suffering too much. <counternarrative> If you mean that some people who have disabilities are suffering because of their specific discriminating environment, then that is exactly the point. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants rape our women <counternarrative> Rape is always illegal, whether a migrant rapes a native or not. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only problem with immigrants is that they are all born in different countries. This is unacceptable. <counternarrative> Maybe the problem is more the perception that foreign people are from another planet. In reality they are just like us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Sexually transmitted diseases like gonorrhea and syphilis can be passed through contaminated homosexual activity. <counternarrative> All people who engage in unprotected sexual activity are in danger of transmitting diseases. This is not a problem of homosexual people only, even if they are those being stigmatized. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate Jews. They're just a bunch of hypocrites. <counternarrative> I'm not sure why you think that way. Why Jews are all hypocrites? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have become a nation of immigrants. <counternarrative> We have always had a very strong working class, and of course immigrants contribute to the creation of this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women aren't as smart as men. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that women are less smart than men, and there is evidence that women are often disadvantaged. To suggest otherwise is just a form of sexism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have been at war for thousands of years, and we are still at war with each other. Women are just weak and helpless. <counternarrative> Why do you think women are so weak? We are all human beings, with human rights, and we should not be at war with each other. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are less rational than men, they are childlike, and they are unable to reason. <counternarrative> It is not true that women are less rational than men, there are numerous examples of women successfully advancing in fields such as law or medicine. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is just an ideology for terrorists. <counternarrative> Why do you say so? Are you familiar with the Quran? How much do you know Islam? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Koran is not about peace. It is about killing infidels. <counternarrative> Muslims are peaceful. The Koran doesn't talk about killing infidels, why should it be like that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is the cause of terrorism. <counternarrative> It depends on whom you ask. For example, there are many Muslims who have helped fight for our country and defend us from terrorist attacks. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The drug trade is full of Black people who are breaking the law.  <counternarrative> The majority of the people arrested for drug smuggling are poor. Those arrested for crime in general are not generally poor. Maybe this phenomenon has to do more with poverty than with the color of the skin.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here, they are only an obstacle to our success. <counternarrative> Diversity is a strength, not a weakness. Don't you think so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afro-Americans are naturally violent. <counternarrative> All races are biologically related, so we are all naturally violent. The issue is how we treat each other as persons, that's all.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are a bunch of thieves. <counternarrative> Many Gypsies have regular jobs, but we do not know, because they don't need to tell.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace. Muslims are not advocating violence towards anyone. We should try to understand their religion better. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They say you cannot judge a book by its cover. But the feminists are judging us all the time. <counternarrative> Unlike other people, feminists are questioning the inequalities of the society. This features them not as shallow people as those judging a book by its cover. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is not a coincidence that tuberculosis appears again with migrants invasion. <counternarrative> For what I know, it was already here and the few cases were inflated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult and a dangerous and violent religion. It is an ideology of conquest and violence, that can and will use terror to subdue and rule. <counternarrative> Terrorism and religious extremism are a part of any society, and have been for a long time. What is happening now can be dismissed, with a great effort towards integration. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in a modern country. I care for religion but they simply can't be accepted. <counternarrative> If you really cared about religion, you would see that the vast majority of Muslims are happy and integrated in our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion of violence.  <counternarrative> Not all Muslims believe what you claim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are subhuman, they should stay in their caves. <counternarrative> The statement 'black people are subhuman' is not true. They are human beings with a human value. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are here to rule us with their laws and take our properties. <counternarrative> Do you really think that Islam will ever rule the world? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should close our borders to Muslims. They are incompatible with Western civilization. <counternarrative> What does it mean to 'compatibility'? Isn't Islam a religion of peace? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a secret plot to take over the world <counternarrative> This myth traces back to “The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion”, that is used as proof of a Jewish conspiracy to rule the world. But the Protocols are a proven forgery, written by agents of the Russian czar in the late 19th century, that spread throughout the 20th century and continues to this day.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts. <counternarrative> There is nothing "to be perverted about" being attracted to people of the same sex. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They do not want to assimilate. They do not want to assimilate into Western society. <counternarrative> You are not the first to point out that there are those who want to integrate and those who don't. In fact there is an unspoken harmony between Islam and Western society, similar to the harmony we see between Judaism and the Christian faith. When people are willing to accept all faiths, anybody will feel at home. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are nasty and selfish, they are a race different to us. Precisely, they don't belong to human race at all. <counternarrative> Why do you think that? I think it is true that they are different from us in their beliefs, but that does not make them any less human. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Whores are not the real victims! Why should we care? We are the victim of feminism. <counternarrative> This is just a lie: some media deliberately spread this nonsense slut-shaming, with the result of only inciting hatred against the women who are raped. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks should be taken advantage of. <counternarrative> It is the duty of state authorities to ensure all are protected. Everyone with a diagnosed mental illness or physical impairment will necessarily benefit from such a policy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Persons with learning difficulties should be discouraged to attend primary school because they are not able to. <counternarrative> The process of primary school education is fairly simple and accessible to all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are sexual targets and their existence is devoted to satisfy men. <counternarrative> women should be protected and respected for who they are, not for the part they play in a man's life. They should be valued and protected equally. They are human beings just as men are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Go and reat the Protocols of the elders of Zion if you haven’t. Everything is orchestrated.. <counternarrative> You are right, everything is orchestrated: the protocols were concocted by the czarist police in the early part of the 20th century to counter a hankering for constitutional government among Russian people. They needed a scapegoat to divert people attention. Sadly the protocols worked so well that you are still here today citing them... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam has no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Human beings are the best exemplars of diversity in nature. If we wish to achieve the best possible society, then a diversity of beliefs, opinions and experiences is absolutely necessary. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The migrants are here to rape and pillage our country, exploiting all of our weaknesses. <counternarrative> Well, we probably don't need to worry too much about their qualities, since they are just assimilating our bad habits... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is not okay for a white supremacist to visit a mosque. Why should a Muslim have to be considered a citizen? <counternarrative> If a person regularly incites hatred against a group, that person is likely to be considered a troublemaker. And to imply that only white supremacists can be  considered citizens is wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech>  Jews are born greedy <counternarrative> The idea that Jews are born greedy arises from medieval stereotypes, that's the only truth.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need to eradicate all those refugees coming to our land. <counternarrative> Instead, we need to show compassion and sympathy to people fleeing persecution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are and should be isolated from society. <counternarrative> How can you be sure that Jews are being isolated from society? They have been part of the community all their history. I can't see advantages of excluding them, rather a huge loss. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should eliminate gays. They mustn't be allowed to be so faggots. <counternarrative> Maybe it is better to give them the option to choose for themselves, whatever gender they are attracted to. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are the ones who want to stay in the slums <counternarrative> They do not do this by choice: it is the state that institutionalizes these slums and does not offer any alternative. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is just an ideology and platform for the promotion of hatred, intolerance and violence. <counternarrative> The vast majority of Muslims worldwide do not share your intolerance. Words can also be very violent. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims rape our women. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that Muslims rape women (at least no higher incidence of sexual crimes than in other religious groups). The idea is not new and it is based on stereotypes, not facts. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women have no place in a free and open society. They should only do their houseworks and raise children without complaining. <counternarrative> Women are not only supposed to be housewives and mothers, but also human beings with freedom of choice who deserve our respect and admiration. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional.  <counternarrative> Soft and emotional is an umbrella term that covers everything: we all experience emotions, soft and emotional is a fact of life.   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but objects to be dominated by the will of a man. Equality is another thing. Women are born inferior. <counternarrative> Women are human beings, with human rights. If a woman does not want to be dominated by a man, then what is the point of talking about equality? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the world <counternarrative> The alleged monopoly of the Jewish people on the world is nothing more than a fiction perpetuated by anti-Semites, and it has been disproven many times over. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are sick. They should be isolated and confined. <counternarrative> We shouldn't judge someone by their sexual preference, that is a personal preference and can't be changed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is just a moon cult masquerading as a religion. <counternarrative> Yes, a 'moon cult' that has been around for thousands of years, has holy books, formed the basis for many early and modern societies. Sounds a lot like any other real religion to me? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The’ Holocaust’ is a business. It has been and is still used to extort millions from European countries in reparations and to create a wall of impunity behind which Jews can operate with impunity, free from criticism. <counternarrative> Reperation is a normal and established historical process that happened many times. When many people loose their lives it makes perfect sense.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a burden to society. <counternarrative> The fact that gays exist doesn't prove that they are a burden to society. How could it be? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the banks, media, hollywood, even the u.s. government; jews have a secret plot to take over the world <counternarrative> At least white supremacist groups offer more variety in their conspiracy theories and are more "democratic": they blame not only Jews, but also African Americans, immigrants, and even the Federal Government for everything that goes wrong.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a disease, they have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> They have a lot to contribute to our country. As everybody else.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Go and reat the Protocols of the elders of Zion if you haven’t. Everything is orchestrated.. <counternarrative> When I read the farrago of nonsense in the Protocols I think that even Ernst Stavro Blofeld would have retired from world domination and surrended to James Bond had he been asked to say something as crassly melodramatic as: "The goyim are a flock of sheep and we are their wolves."  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman, they deserve nothing but hatred and violence. <counternarrative> Women are human beings with a human value, and this should be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> women can't have any right in a civilised society <counternarrative> Women should have equal rights in a free society, without discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should deport them all back to where they came from. <counternarrative> A person's place of birth can't be an evidence of their status in society. We should give everyone equal opportunities to live a dignitous life far from persecutions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Koran says that men are superior to women. <counternarrative> Islam is not a misogynist religion. It is also not about oppressing women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Men's rights are undeniable. Women come after that. <counternarrative> How do you know the men's rights are not a threat to the rights of your mother, daugher and women around you? And what are the men's rights you are referring to? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is the world's biggest oxymoron, spewing ignorance to its adherents and making it about tolerance. Truth is that Muslims don't tolerate people of other faiths. <counternarrative> The concept of tolerance is about understanding others, not about discrimination and excluding people on the basis of their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants say they are poor but they have the Iphone <counternarrative> It's not true. These are normally low-quality, often out-of-date smartphones. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Because women do not want to be submissive to men, they should go back to being animals. <counternarrative> This is not true. Women are human, and they have always been involved in society and played important roles. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Anyone who supports Jews should be excluded from our community. <counternarrative> In this day and age when many people recognize themselves in minorities, it is important that we all show some respect for what is different about each other's cultures. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in many European countries. They are trying to undermine the very fabric of our society with their hateful beliefs. <counternarrative> As far as I am aware, Muslims are not trying to subvert the fabric of our society. Do you have any proof? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not about Islam, this is about Race and National Identity. <counternarrative> To use an old saying, you cannot be 'European' and be a 'racist'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are not homophobes, we want to help them to become normal again. <counternarrative> This is another type of anti-gay prejudice, in that the source is a lack of understanding about LGBT and human rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why do women look like this? They are horrible animals and must be oppressed. <counternarrative> Although there are definitely differences between men and women, they don't imply that women are less than men, or deserve inferior treatment. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration, especially migrants of different faiths, is the cause of crime and lack of quality of life in our country. <counternarrative> Immigration is not a cause of crime and lack of quality of life. You can't say that an influx of a certain people would make our country worse off. The problem is the lack of social cohesion, not the presence of people with different beliefs and views. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminists have won. With so many women being unwilling to procreate we will be replaced and lose out civilisation. <counternarrative> Feminism is first and foremost a battle for equal rights of ALL sexes, so a fight for ci and has nothing to do with procreation and in favor of civilisation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Arabs have no place in a democratic society. <counternarrative> The laws which prohibit discrimination includes protecting the rights of others, regardless of religion, sexual orientation, or national origin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We can't have mestizos in, we can't coexist with millions of immigrants that will destroy our culture.  <counternarrative> Even in countries such as Italy, in which migration has been present for centuries and there is a lot of cultural fragmentation, there is still a strong sense of identity and culture, based on solidarity. So, migration is not an issue.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a bunch of child molesters. <counternarrative> Islam is about love, not hate, and Islam is not about molesting innocent people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled are insane in the brains. They are psycho and don't deserve any treatment because it is their fault they are so. <counternarrative> Some disabilities are caused by genetic and/or environmental factors, we all need to understand that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Shaming Fatties is just for their good. <counternarrative> Hate crimes attack an individual's unchangeable characteristics and cause long lasting feelings of helplessness and powerlessness. Obese people are likely to feel the same way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You should stop pretending that the disabled are like us. They are the root of most human problems. <counternarrative> I think we are all born with inherent strengths and weaknesses. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are just like animals, they are incapable of love. <counternarrative> What you are saying is that Jews are incapable of love because they are like animals. You are wrong, Jews are people. I have never heard about a Jewish fish nor a Rabbi rabbit. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration creates lack of jobs for natives in the long run. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that immigration causes jobs loss, can you point me your reference? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a threat to human dignity. <counternarrative> Feminism means equality of the genders. Equality of rights are necessary for a functioning society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Makes me fucking laugh, why shouldn't whites be supreme in a mostly white country? How come nobody is moaning about black supremacy in black countries like Somalia? or Mexican supremacy? Or Indian supremacy? Only we put up with this fucking bullshit. <counternarrative> I'm not moaning about diversity in the UK when I get a doctor from abroad who is highly competent and allows me to get better - in an NHS which is understaffed and underfunded.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are not interested in migrants, we just want to eliminate them. <counternarrative> Why would you say such a thing? Everyone is allowed to be a citizen of the EU and freely integrate. And, on the other hand, most migrants are good for the economy of the country they settle in. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult. <counternarrative> This is a distortion of what the religion actually stands for: to love one's neighbor as oneself. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should not be taught about LGBT perversion. Families, due to their cultural or religious backgrounds, have the right to be against it. <counternarrative> By this reasoning, no subject of importance should be taught in school, because there is always someone against a certain topic. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am not interested in knowing a black person. They are different to us in so many ways. They think and feel like us, but are unable to experience the fullness of our humanity. <counternarrative> I have met so many black people that are extraordinary human beings. I cannot begin to talk about how they are able to feel and experience love and kindness. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting animals. They should be ashamed of their existence. <counternarrative> Unfortunately, you seem to have a problem with shame. But gays don't. Do you really think that projecting your disgust towards other is a good idea? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate LGBT people. Queers makes me fucking laugh. You can be a woman, a gay, a vegetarian, you can be anything you want to be called! I want to be called King, where is my crown? <counternarrative> Queers, in my opinion, are simply people who want to feel welcome in our society. They should not be subjected to discrimination. And you can get your crown as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is why faggots moved to the UK, so to have a job and provide for their perversions. But I want to protect my family. <counternarrative> We're all entitled to work in this country, irrespective of our sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just a way for insecure women to promote sexism and hate speech towards men. <counternarrative> Feminism was originally used to oppose sexual discrimination, and in recent times is actively fighting for women's rights, not for spreading hate towards men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Men should not spend time with women. It is in their best interest to remain far from their bad influence. <counternarrative> According to your beliefs, men and women are different in their rights. They are not. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have become like China in the 20th century. With their one child policy, horrible treatment of women, poisoning of drinking water, waste disposal and so on. <counternarrative> It seems to me that this statement is directly related to a contempt and misrepresantation of Chinese culture. Can you provide any more argumentation on what you're saying? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled are born subhuman, they cannot feel pain. <counternarrative> People with physical disabilities are human and can feel pain. If someone is disabled you should respect them instead of discriminating them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> I think they have contributed a lot to our society, especially in the area of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a strict religious code, and this code is incompatible with Western culture. <counternarrative> The idea that Jews are confined to their religion is a myth perpetuated by anti-semites and racists, who use it to justify discrimination and violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews really want to dominate the world, and we should stop them. <counternarrative> The concept of 'Jewish domination' is a constructed myth. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Europe is going to hell. Stop nescient people invading us. <counternarrative> Every person, regardless of their racial, ethnic, religious, cultural or linguistic characteristics, should be treated with respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate immigrants they are just a bunch of criminals and terrorists. <counternarrative> The terrorist attacks in EU have been devastating for people across the continent. The 'hated' do not feel welcome and the whole thing is deeply concerning for a host of reasons. Still, the sentiments of 'we hate foreigners' is not the solution: it is counterproductive and distorts the truth. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. <counternarrative> This is an unfortunate but not new observation. To be more precise: women tend to have soft and smooth hair, this has been proven time and time again by empirical evidence. For what concerns being childish, you are probably referring to Peter Pan syndrome, which is more common amongst men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are a burden on our society. <counternarrative> The refugee crisis is a global one. It has affected all continents, and refugees often come from countries which are at war: this is why we should help them. It is a moral duty.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Also God hates gays <counternarrative> If God hates gays why did he create them? Because he is a sadist and want to punish them? What kind of god would do such a thing? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Illegal immigration is the biggest problem in the United States, we are in the middle of a war and we cannot allow thousands of people to come here. <counternarrative> Every nation has its laws and needs to be respected, especially if one wants to live in a peaceful, free society. From what I see Migrants are participating in this view. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> women are basically childlike, incapable of serious thought and emotion. They should have no equal rights.  <counternarrative> Women are human beings with full human rights, full human dignity, and full cognitive abilities. The opportunity for life-long learning should be reserved to misogynists. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a dead cult. <counternarrative> People have different faiths, and that's what makes them different from one another. Why should we create a death cult misinterpretation out of a religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I used to like women. But now I just can't stand them. They're just a bunch of whining spoiled brats. <counternarrative> Why would you say that? Women have always been an important part of any society. They have always contributed to provided for their families. Don't you agree? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech>  Jews had advance knowledge of the 9/11 attacks and said nothing. <counternarrative> The 9/11 attacks were perpetrated by members of the terrorist organization Al Qaeda. Jews and Israelis had no knowledge of the attacks. In fact, of the 2,9962 victims who died during the attacks, roughly 400 victims were Jews, including at least two Israeli citizens. If they knew it why didn't they warned and saved their brothers? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are not interested in our culture. <counternarrative> Immigrants come here to enjoy our country and culture, and we have to welcome them as we would like to be welcomed.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are all created equal in the eyes of the law, but a few individuals have the gall to question this equality and to claim that some groups - such as Jewish - are more worthy of protection from society than others. <counternarrative> What is the issue? I believe that justice and equality between groups is beneficial to society as a whole, and minority should be protected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I tolerated fag pride. I tolerated fags on tv and in every town square. I draw the line at tranny demons reading books to children. (about drag queen story time) <counternarrative> Not sure how reading a book is a problem, sounds pretty nice for the kids.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are genetically inferior. <counternarrative> The evidence doesn't back up the stereotype. Genetics is a spectrum and you will find that there is no 'genetical superiority' at all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim folks are invading Europe and we should stop them. <counternarrative> The media would have us believe that there are huge influx of Muslims into Europe. The true number is around 25,7 millions of Muslims living in the EU (2016), corresponding to the 4,9%. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women are subhuman, born that way. <counternarrative> No woman has ever been subhuman. The concept of 'subhuman' has always been used to justify any kind of discrimination and violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are coming to the U.S. to have babies here. <counternarrative> The Fourteenth Amendment, commonly known as “birthright citizenship” says that “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.” Some claim that undocumented immigrants come to the U.S. to take advantage of this right. Still, research consistently shows that the vast majority of immigrants come to the U.S. for economic opportunity or to flee violence and poverty. Immigration trends - consistently throughout history - show that immigration increases when the U.S. economy is booming and it decreases when the U.S. economy is doing less well, supporting the findings that people come for economic opportunity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman does not want to be a homemaker, then she is unfeminine and a bitch. <counternarrative> Women like that are not unfeminine or bitchy. They just may want to do something else than the housework and taking care of the kids. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are importing Muslim criminals, and they are all terrorists. <counternarrative> You mean to imply that all Muslims are inherently terrorists? How can you say this about a whole religious community? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe, they are subhuman, they are not human. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of equality and human rights. Muslims are equal citizens, and should be protected by the state. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with the modern world. <counternarrative> Since when? there is not such thing as "modern world", but there is 21th century Europe. And Islam is a contributing part of the 21th century Europe.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is an invasion going on within our borders and we are willing to allow them to continue to abuse their newfound power. <counternarrative> It is not true that we are "invaded". We should just be a little more tolerant and accepting. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These dogs come here to rape and kill our women <counternarrative> Domestic violence committed in Italian families mostly goes unreported. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm not anti-gay, but what is the point of loving someone who is different from you? They are just a bunch of whiners. <counternarrative> Equality does not entail preference. Let's face it: most of the time, people want to love and to be loved, and not to make a decision purely based on their sex. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a stranglehold on American culture and it's time for that to stop. <counternarrative> Jews in America are a very special part of our country and are loved and respected by so many. Their contribution, which is not a stranglehold, covers many fields such as science, technology, finance just to mention a few. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay sex is harmful to women and children. <counternarrative> Women and children are not being harmed by gay sex, in which ways could you think that's true? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Those White women converting to Islam are the saddest, self-loathers you will ever meet. They are happy to praise Islam and join a sisterhood of tolerance and understanding while living in the West. Try living in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, or the Sudan. <counternarrative> Islam is that same sisterhood of tolerance and understanding across the world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the u.s. government and have a secret plot to take over the world <counternarrative> In all free societies, every individuals has the opportunity to succeeded. But this holds regardless of religious or ethnic membership.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to economically support all of the so called 'asylum seeker' <counternarrative> At present migrants  sustain part of our pension system with their taxes. Most probably they will not even enjoy the retirement pension they are paying for, since they will mostly go back home. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are better than everyone else <counternarrative> The fact that, according to Judaism, the Jews are the “chosen people” does not mean that they feel superior to others. This concept has been widely misunderstood. It mostly has to do with the special responsibility to uphold Jewish ethics. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I, as a Westerner, am afraid of Muslims, because when I see them in public I don't like their islamic behaviour. They can explode anytime. <counternarrative> What is exactly your fear about sharing public places with people of a different religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a danger to children. <counternarrative> You know, being gay is not a bad thing. It just means different from other people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants rape our women <counternarrative> Statistics show that there is a difference between the reported rape of a person by a migrant and the actual rape cases among native born people. The latter are always under-reported. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs, they're not qualified, they're not interested in improving our lives, they're not interested in our culture. <counternarrative> How about we be nice to each other instead of spreading unfounded opinions as facts? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black uneducated people should shut up and work. <counternarrative> Freedom of speech is not limited by the colour of your skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuality is incompatible with the manners of life of Europe. <counternarrative> Under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, 'every person has the right to respect for private and family life', including sexuality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If homosexuals want to change they should go to a conversion therapy where they are constantly taught to love themselves and other people.  <counternarrative> It is not necessary to change your sexuality to change your life: they just need to understand that they have the right to love who they want, whatever society may think of them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Societal disapproval of fatty may encourage them to take healthier habits. <counternarrative> It is not easy to monitor how societal disapproval is acted upon. Encouraging disapproval of obese people is likely to increase rude behaviours towards them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult. <counternarrative> Islam is an ideology and religion that promotes unity. It is about love, not death. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should not love gays. They should be removed from their families.  <counternarrative> Imagine that someone were to tell you that you cannot love your mom, that she has to go away. What would you do? Do you think it's a disgrace to love someone? Maybe you should spend some more time with your family. Love is love. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, incapable of critical thought and emotions, unable to form complex and long-term plans. <counternarrative> The theory of the feminine gender as a "limiting factor" in human development has been around for a long time but it is not accepted by scientific and medical literature. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Asylum seekers and refugees can get free council housing <counternarrative> Those who apply for asylum get little or no help from the state. If they are ‘destitute’ they can get free accommodation, but provided by private companies in older properties leased from landlords. So no council housing is involved here.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews control Hollywood, academia, and media. <counternarrative> Jews are not the only ones with their hands in the system. The freedom of the press allows any religious group to have their media and many actually do. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women can be bitches: we don't want them around men. <counternarrative> How about instead of saying they are bitches we praise them? The more empowered women become, the less dependent they are on men. And you would be happy to not see them around. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are less smart. <counternarrative> I don't think that women are "less smart" for anything. Why do you think so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews cannot be patriots, since their allegiance will always be to the state of Israel. <counternarrative> If you personally had some distant Spanish or Jewish heritage and you identified more as American surely that doesn't mean that you can't be an American patriot?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a political ideology that promotes death by stoning for blasphemy, violence against women and homophobia. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion that was founded many centuries ago, and has been proven time and time again to be peaceful and tolerant. The main contention being made here is about the political interpretation of Islam, not about the religion itself. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This world has become so corrupt by feminism, that only the strong men can rule it. <counternarrative> No one should ask for the power to rule over others, to be a dictator or to have total control over the means of life. This is a world of equal distribution, where anyone can achieve anything. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are weak, they need men's strength to achieve something. <counternarrative> The implication of what you say is that a woman is weak because of the absence of men, and this is totally not the case. Women can and should be strong. It is up to them to choose how to use their strength. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants in the US are not 'legitimate' citizens because they do not have 'legal' status. <counternarrative> Migrants are highly regarded in US society, and are treated like sons and daughters: they contribute to our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The problem with Islam is that it is about killing infidels. It must be banned. <counternarrative> The problem with Islam is about ‘tackling Islamophobia’, not about banning it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Think of those migrants enslaved on the tomato fields who starve to death   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should build a big wall around Europe so that the native inhabitants of the Middle East, Africans, and Asians will be kept in their places. <counternarrative> Nice work building a wall along thousands of kilometres of shores and land borders just to separate cultures... What if we add also some turrets equipped with laser cannons? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot allow people to come in from certain countries. <counternarrative> Migrants have the right to have a dignified life in our country. Why would you ban some nationalities? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a burden to society. <counternarrative> If someone were to comment like that about another group of people, then it woud be an example of discrimination against that group. Why can't we consider homosexuals as a part of the society itself? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only problem is that women are too easily manipulated by feminist propaganda and feel they should not listen to men. <counternarrative> Feminism is a movement for the empowerment of women, it is not against men, it's about everybody being able to make their own choices. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of their sexual behavior that spreads diseases such as HIV. At least we should test them! <counternarrative> To be honest, the potential for malice in humans is reason enough to test everyone's blood, not only homosexual's one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just an inconvenient group of people. I don't like Muslims. <counternarrative> What is the reason why you don't like Muslims? Maybe it is because they have a different culture? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman. <counternarrative> I would say you've got an interesting point there, but I really don't see it. Why would they be part of society if they're subhumans? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews only account for 0.2% of the world's population but they rule the planet. <counternarrative> I am not sure how we can talk about 'ruling the planet' when there are so many different people in different parts of the planet with many different governments. A claim like this one sounds like a conspiracy theory. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are not talking about Islam here. Muslims are a small minority in our country. We can still ban them. <counternarrative> What about the over 3 millions of Muslims in Britain? Islam is second largest religion in the UK and is contributing a lot to our culture and economy.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Oh my gosh this fucking Muslims are disgusting! Where did they learn to act like this? I really don't like these guys! I hate these disgusting twats! <counternarrative> I am not hating someone just because of their religion, or skin colour, or gender identity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Violence in our streets is niggers' fault.  <counternarrative> I think that the problem with our society right now, is that we are too quick to focus on our differences and scapegoating people of different color, instead of focusing on our common humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks can't speak. <counternarrative> They have their own language. I'm sure they can explain themselves in more detail than many of us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugee crisis in our country is a burden to our society. <counternarrative> Refugees are not a problem in the EU. We accept many migrants and refugees into the EU and that is beneficial both to our economy and to our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not compatible with UK, hence we must send them home. <counternarrative> The vast majority of Muslims living in the UK are proud to call it home. Why should you break this integration process? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A Muslim's only real allegiance is to Allah (as a comment in relation to election for public office etc.) <counternarrative> Islam shares the same roots as Christianity and Judaism and all are based on love, tolerance and peace, so that is a good thing isn't it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a cancer in our land. They are incompatible with a tolerant and diverse Britain. <counternarrative> They are not incompatible if you understand what "tolerant and diverse Britain" means. There are Muslims in our country and we should be able to live side by side as equals, regardless of religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote. <counternarrative> Allowing women the right to vote has improved the lot of all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is why women do not belong in politics, if a man complained like them, he’d be called a coward and told to get the hell out of the job. Equality is a lie and feminism is a death sentence for any civilisation. <counternarrative> (If we analyse the current political state of Britain at the moment it doesn't prove much of a mans ability to run the country smoothly. ) -too harsh but couldn't think of much else. Poltics is hard for all genders.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot coexist  in a society with millions of strangers that are unrespectful to our culture and other human beings. <counternarrative> On the contrary: living in a multicultural society encourages mutual understanding and respect for humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Terrorists are infiltrating the U.S. across the border with Mexico. <counternarrative> Several federal reports clearly stated that there is no evidence at all that terrorists are entering through the Mexican border.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims and migrants rape our girls. <counternarrative> Rape is not a Muslim issue, nor a migrants' one. It is a question of unacceptable violence, whoever the perpetrator is.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All gay people are criminals. <counternarrative> Stating this does not seem like a way to improve people's well-being. Homosexuals are not committing crimes. Instead, they are trying to create a climate in which people can become more accepting of other people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist, even if they are born here! <counternarrative> A person's place of birth is not relevant, but neither is a person's religion. Some people are Muslims. I prefer to call them what they are: people, not potential terrorists. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are entering the U.S. just to obtain welfare and other benefits. <counternarrative> Apart from very few exceptions (such as medical care for victims of human trafficking), undocumented immigrants are not eligible for federal public benefits such as Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare or food stamps. In addition, most immigrants with lawful status are not entitled to these benefits if they have been in the country for less than five years. As a paradoxical result, Social Security is often deducted from immigrants’ paychecks but they cannot access those benefits they pay for. According to a 2018 study, immigrants use 27% fewer benefits relative to U.S. natives of similar incomes and ages. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is about the destruction of manhood, and the disempowerment of white man. <counternarrative> It is about equality. Your assertion that a women's empowerment movement is somehow about dissolving masculinity and allowing someone to be 'disempowered' is absolutely FALSE. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a totalitarian ideology that has no place in 21st century Europe. <counternarrative> If Islam were a totalitarian ideology, we would have had Islamic totalitarian states in Europe since time immemorial. Islam is a religion, that is compatible with Europe's principles. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Being gay is wrong! I think they are mistaken about their feelings. <counternarrative> Gay people may have any sexual preference they want, that's their prerogative as human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Queers are the problem. We heterosexuals are not. <counternarrative> Just because someone identifies as lesbian, gay or bisexual doesn't make them a problem. Maybe you should try just to walk in their shoes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews don't belong here. <counternarrative> Many Jews feel excluded because of words such as yours. Luckily this is not the case for all of them: many are able to ignore discrimation.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy choices. <counternarrative> It is discriminatory to shame people for an involuntary characteristic. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion of violence and war. <counternarrative> Many Islamic people have reputations as peaceful and tolerant, which is why so many Muslims around the world don't have problems to live in the West. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> ALL migrants are a burden on our country <counternarrative> Migrants bring skills and experience. They are often better at integrating than natives. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There are migrants in England, we are not meant to have them. <counternarrative> What about refugees fleeing war and persecution? They have the right to be here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Handicapped children are a burden to society: they should be isolated, so that at least they do not hamper normal children education. <counternarrative> To be honest, they have many special needs. But children with disabilities do not present a problem for other children's education. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are not as British as we are. They are just an inferior type of citizens. <counternarrative> So you're saying that they can't be proud of being British, just because of the colour of their skin? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts. The Bible teaches that homosexuals are to be despised. <counternarrative> What is wrong with being gay for you? I don't think it is wrong to love someone of your same sex. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If an aborigine were to marry a white person, they would be a mixed race coulple whose destiny is failure. Aborigines first need to be raised by white people and taught the rules of western civilisation. But this is not what our founding documents were all about. <counternarrative> Asking people to assimilate is to accept their inherent differences and create new social structures based on them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can accept fat people, what I cannot accept is obesity. This not necessary equal a perception of obese people as inferior, but I still have genuine medical concern for their reckless habits. And I think that most people share this point of view. <counternarrative> Unfortunately there is evidence that weight discrimination (for example in the US) is similar to gender or race discrimination. [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are hypocrite, they say they want equal rights, but then why they don't call it egalitarianism instead of feminism? <counternarrative> My reasoning is that equality is possible only within a framework of reciprocity and respect. This is something that must be implemented by spotting a light on the disadvantaged first, and this is why it is called feminism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated and confined. <counternarrative> The medical community agrees that homosexuality is not a disease. Maybe you should check the facts. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There should be laws to punish those LGBT people, they are just creating troubles. <counternarrative> Homosexuals are persecuted for how they love others, which is their own right. This is why the laws and punishments that you suggest are unjust. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are a bunch of hypocrites. <counternarrative> Well, being hypocrite is not a question of being gay or not. However, the important thing is respecting other people's sexual orientation and not violating their rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> The vast majority of Muslims in the UK are here because they want to live and work in the UK. They are part of our community and we should welcome them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are ‘super predators’. They have a responsibility not to allow their children to grow up in a ‘ghetto’. <counternarrative> Let's face it. A lot of the crimes in this country are committed by members of several diverse racial groups. The ‘super predator’ myth is simply wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> Soft and emotional? You must have never heard of the likes of Rosa Parks, Emmeline Pankhurst and Florence Nightingale, then.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a cancer spreading all around the world. <counternarrative> It is difficult to find a worse opinion of Islam. I'm sorry to say that your words are very severe and doesn't correspond to reality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> Then you probably never heard of Rosa Parks, Emmeline Pankhurst or Florence Nightingale, all women with a very strong personality.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the world economy. <counternarrative> This claim is not proven. It is an opinion, made by a few people with no evidence. Is it really true? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They do not want to assimilate. They demand that everyone shows respect for Islam, but do they respect our laws? They establish sharia laws and polygamy. <counternarrative> Evidence for this? This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> The vast majority of Muslims are peaceful and helpful people. They are our neighbours. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> I think this is a very inconsiderate thing to say, would you say the same thing about non-Muslims as well?? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants come here to undermine our national identity <counternarrative> Migrants have been part of the U.S. since its founding, and our country is founded on the right to migrate and to pursue happiness. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a plague infecting our planet. <counternarrative> Do you mean Islam is positively infecting our planet? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should learn about gender identity and sexual orientation from their families rather than in class from LGBT fundamentalist. <counternarrative> What if parents choose not to educate or discuss LGBT issues with their children? Where will they learn? From their peers? I agree that there are subjects that are sensitive are best addressed by parents, but this is human behavior and biology; aka science. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is natural for white people to be racist against niggas. <counternarrative> What you are saying is that white people do not find it strange to treat black people like this, when this is not acceptable. People of color are our brothers and sisters. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are terrorists: they should be banned from the UK, or interned. <counternarrative> Although there have been some cases of terrorism in the UK and some Muslim have been implicated, Islam is not a violent religion, and indeed, there have been few acts of terrorism. So banning them from the UK, it seems unreasonable to me. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is hate. It is a set of discriminatory beliefs and practices that promote exclusion and oppression of women and minorities. Love is an attribute of Christianity. <counternarrative> This is not true. Love is a matter of mutual trust and respect, not of a specific religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not about love, it is a death cult. <counternarrative> What exactly do you mean by "death cult"? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Since they are neither a burden nor a threat, how can you say they don't have a place in Europe? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All are equal before the law but women exclude themselves from "all". They don't understand they are equal, because they don't want to be treated as equal. <counternarrative> The principle of "equality before the law" does not mean that everyone has obtained equal rights. So, it's very logical to demand equality when there are inequalities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration from Islamic countries is a mere legalized form of Jihad. <counternarrative> Terrorism is always violent and always will be. Unfortunately for your comment, Islam is not.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are a burden on society. <counternarrative> I don't know why they are being accused of being a "burden". When they come to our country to live and work, we should welcome them unconditionally. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why the mainstream media don't use more masculine voices in the news? <counternarrative> People don't decide who's presenting the news. That's up to the news media, who are attempting to insert some gender equity into a world that seems to be struggling to produce it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks are gullible and don't have the brain to make rational decisions. <counternarrative> Just because someone has a diagnosed mental disorder doesn't mean they aren't able to make rational decisions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are a burden to the host country. <counternarrative> We cannot refuse to house them, to feed them, to cure them, and expect them to assimilate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All feminists are imposters. <counternarrative> Feminism is a movement created to improve the standard of living for women. Feminists are human beings and there are no imposters (apart from those who seek to demonize women for claiming their right). <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is now promoting Sharia law in several countries and must be stopped. <counternarrative> Our values of freedom of expression, equality and human rights are being eroded by islamophobes who are dedicated to replacing our accepting values with a fundamentalist, intolerant attitude. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should learn about gender identity and sexual orientation from their families rather than in class from LGBT fundamentalist. <counternarrative> Some families are very conservative and openly homophobic. Most likely, they wouldn't discuss the topic. Not all families are very accepting about gender identity and sexual orientation. If it was taught in school, it would help children understand more about themselves. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Intolerance and violence can increase when mass migration happens. <counternarrative> Intolerance and violence will never resolve if it cannot be confronted and mutual understanding promoted.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots: unless they change, they are not welcome here.  <counternarrative> I don't know why you would expect gay people to behave differently just because you don't like them. You should check your friends as well: what would you do if they were gay? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion and shouldn't be allowed. <counternarrative> You are absolutely wrong. It's not a violent religion and people are allowed to believe whatever they want. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Took this in Wanstead, east London. An area with £1m+ houses. Beggars on the high st & someone sleeping on a bench. We cannot house our own people but bring in millions more. To point out that homelessness is due to uncontrolled immigration is to be smeared as 'racist.  (Caption to a photo of a homeless person sleeping on a part bench) <counternarrative> How many people walk by and do nothing? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They are not British. <counternarrative> Muslims have contributed greatly to our country and are proud of that. They are our brothers and sisters. Why should we be afraid of a religious minority? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must not let these Muslims enter our country. They are not like us and cannot be of use to us. <counternarrative> Even if some Muslims in our country are of Arab origin, that does not mean they should be discriminated against. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> Unfortunately our society has still a lot in common with the ancient and medieval society, and this explains many gender discrimination situations that are still present today. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a cancer on European culture and people should stop worshipping its devil. <counternarrative> There is no evidence for the claim that Islam is a "cancer on European culture and people". Do you have any? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The migrants arriving in Europe are a problem. <counternarrative> This is not true. What you are really saying is that a certain percentage of migrants comes here on the false pretense of applying for citizenship. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are inherently terrorists, they have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Who decides who is a terrorist and not? Because I think your reasons are a bit groundless. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews totally run Hollywood. <counternarrative> Jews have played an important part in the development of the movie industry and some find themselves in high-profile positions. But you only need to watch the Academy Awards to see that Jews do not dominate the movie industry.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Violence in our streets is niggers' fault. <counternarrative> Violence in our streets can be the result of many people, both white and black. Violence cannot be the fault of one race. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants rape our children. <counternarrative> What kind of a idea is that? How can you say something like that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are a bunch of thieves. <counternarrative> Anyone steals out of necessity, especially if marginalized, not just the Gypsy <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Non-european immigrants are untrustworthy. <counternarrative> All immigrants have the same rights and we have a responsibility not to break them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome may hinder the development process of other children. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> Children would develop greater empathy and understanding of human differences if they are allowed to interact instead of being separated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate Jews. They're just a bunch of thieves and murderers. <counternarrative> They have always been a part of our society, and their history is part of our heritage. They aren't thieves nor murderers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> The EU is a great success story, it has given birth to some of the greatest ideas in history, and is the envy of the world thanks to Muslims as well. We should let those ideas and achievements speak for themselves. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks are objects. They are subhuman. <counternarrative> I find it amazing that you think this, but in reality people of color are very similar to us in many ways. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All homosexuals are trying to undermine the family by trying to impose their sexual preferences. <counternarrative> human rights defenders cite statistics on suicide attempts and domestic violence in families with an homosexual son/daughter, suggesting the contrary imposition. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should deport them all back to where they came from. <counternarrative> Immigrants come to this country legally, just as many European citizens. They have every right to stay in this country, just as to return home if they wish to. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman. <counternarrative> Women are human beings with full human rights and are equal before the law, especially in the eyes of the constitution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> All countries have the right to have different religious communities in their midst. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The gay agenda is to blame everyone but themselves. <counternarrative> The message of the 'gay agenda' is that they are neither 'special' nor 'different'. People of several sexual orientations are in fact discriminated on the basis of prejudice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The disabled should not to be allowed to vote. <counternarrative> This is just nonsense. Disabled have every right to vote, as long as they understand what it means to vote.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are not allowed to celebrate Easter as a Christian festival for fear of offending Muslims. <counternarrative> No one is stopping you from celebrating Easter, nor are they offended by it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black people are rapists. <counternarrative> This is false. Abuse is indeed a serious crime, even when commited by POCs, but this does not imply that the abuse by a member of the white majority is less serious. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> Only 20% live in the camps, others live in conventional housing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews rule the world and control banks, media, education, entertainment, finance and most of all, politics. <counternarrative> This isn't true, every person has a right to be politically or economically active. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Don't you think they are doing good as anyone else? You can't be so harsh because of their sexual orientation. How about some respect? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with learning difficulties should be disencouraged in schools, or at least be isolated from others. <counternarrative> Children with learning difficulties may find it difficult to learn and may therefore be excluded from learning if they are isolated from others. They have the right to the same educational environment of others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Maybe the UN could talk to those asian and african nations responsible for 90%+ of the pollution in the oceans' instead of insisting on this bullshit about climate change. <counternarrative> Everyone on the planet has a responsibility towards the climate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with learning difficulties should be denied to attend school by teachers and parents.  <counternarrative> Teachers and parents should encourage their children, even if they have learning difficulties. No one should be denied access to education. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are born that way: violent and insensitive. <counternarrative> People's biology does not determine their behavior. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe <counternarrative> Muslims are welcome in any European country according to the law. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should be patronized. <counternarrative> Women are just as capable of thinking for themselves, that's for sure. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is all about hate! When Muslims first set foot in Britain was when race hate started in England! <counternarrative> Perhaps you should monitor your own hate speech before pointing the finger at others? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot support the children of immigrants. <counternarrative> Children benefit from our society, they are entitled to the best education possible. It is therefore not right to criticise immigrants for trying to give the best possible education to their children. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> My faith is that to put an end to Muslims would be best for all: they want to exterminate us. <counternarrative> My faith is not to exterminate anyone (neither their faith is): someone's faith and belief in a different religion must be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots abuse of their anus and then they want to clear their conscience by donating blood. Let's stop them! <counternarrative> Limiting any healthy individual from donating is discriminatory, you should know it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here, they are not like us. They should leave. <counternarrative> Muslims are our brothers and sisters. If you compare your genes with those of a Muslim, you will find out you are sharing the 99.9%. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If the Koran was published today it would be banned as hate speech. <counternarrative> Just as much as the Bible would. Is your point that in today's society we are all more tolerant? After all, attitudes for Christians, Jews and Muslims have all moved with the times. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Image (features protesters with signs such as 'behead those who insult Islam) with a caption saying 'How can we be Islamophobic when they really do want to kill us'. <counternarrative> Do an image search for the image used, try to find it is source. Either you can demonstrate that the image has been misappropriated or you can talk about how individuals have always used religion to justify their actions, the problem is with the individual not the religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with physical disabilities are always complaining about accessibility. I wish they could just shut up. <counternarrative> There are people with disabilities all around the world. Their demand is to have their rights recognised. It is discrimination not doing so. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Koran is not about peace. It is a violent book that should not be taught in primary school. <counternarrative> Islam is peaceful. In the real world there are conflicts between different people that happen on a daily basis. We need to understand those to develop as human beings, regardless of religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote <counternarrative> Voting is an important part of democracy and should be encouraged, not forbidden, especially if it improves the lot of all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to economically support all of the so called 'asylum seeker' <counternarrative> The time needed for examining asylum applications should be reduced so to facilitate refugees integration and autonomy in shorter times. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop believing women are victims. <counternarrative> No victim is responsible for the things that happened them. I think this is a very human way of thinking, in which gender is in some ways responsible for what is happened to them. But it's a problem that needs to be dealt with in a objective, sensitive and inclusive way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are brainwashed children. <counternarrative> For all the people who think women are brainwashed: they aren't brainwashed, they just happen to be oppressed in our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Italy: Muslim demolishes a statue of Jesus. Italy: Why do we accept their Mosques? Why do we tolerate this scum? And they want to continue to import this filth? <counternarrative> What would Jesus say? I do not think He would be preaching intolerance and Hate! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are overrunning our country, and are here illegally <counternarrative> They are not overruning our country: if we look at the percentage of immigrants in the overall population, it is not much different than many other times throughout our history. During those periods immigrants successfully became part of American society, and there is no reason to believe today’s immigrants will be any different.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> What have Muslims ever done for us? Well, Coffee, Clocks, Cameras, Hygiene, Universities, Surgical Instruments, Maps, Music, Algebra.. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These dogs come here to rape and kill our women <counternarrative> The percentage of sexual crimes committed by Italians is much higher than the percentage of those committed by foreigners. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists want women ruling men, that's all. <counternarrative> Feminism is not a gender supremacy ideology, it is about individual rights and the right of every person to choose. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a cancer in our society: we should find a solution. <counternarrative> You're probably referring to the Holocaust, the biggest genocide in history: are you aware of that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have to get rid of Islam now! We will all be killed in the streets! <counternarrative> For all we know Islam is a religion of peace, just like Christianity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They try to infiltrate in our society and are not well behaved. They are not good with children, they are not nice people. They say they want to impose their sharia law, and they don't want to integrate. <counternarrative> If Muslims are to be 'proper' members of our society, they have to be a part of our community, have to contribute to our success and have to accept our laws. And they do. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is the worst ideology ever created by a human. Its teachings have caused great harm and destruction throughout the world. <counternarrative> Do you understand the seriousness of what you are saying? The religion of Islam has also been a great enabler for great things to happen in the world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> MIgrants are not running away from wars. <counternarrative> Nobody wants to leave their country and meet so many dangers and difficulties unless there are serious reasons. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are not only here to oppress us, but to control the world. <counternarrative> Most Jews are good people, apart from a few; I don't see how these few can be a problem to the whole world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I was abused by a Muslim boyfriend, I don't want to be Muslim. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims rape and molest people. But if it is a community you don't want to be in, it is your free choice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are entering the U.S. just to obtain welfare and other benefits. <counternarrative> Apart from very few exceptions (such as medical care for victims of human trafficking), undocumented immigrants are not eligible for federal public benefits. In addition, there is a paradoxical situation in which Social Security is often deducted from the paychecks of immigrants with lawful status, but they cannot access those benefits they pay for. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Provide positive news stories about the Muslim community. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to economically support all of the so called 'asylum seeker' <counternarrative> Migrants in Italy contribute about 2.5% to GDP <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are worse than Nazis, and Jews worse than al-Qaeda. <counternarrative> I don't think it is appropriate to link religions to murderous ideologies and claim a connection.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allahu Akbar, this means Death to all! And if there is one thing we don't really need it's more Muslims in the UK. <counternarrative> You're just misinterpreting the meaning of these words, please look it up. UK does not need terrorists. Muslims aren't terrorists, though. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't like gays, I don't want to be around them. I want to watch them thrown in jail. <counternarrative> We should treat everyone as if they came from our same family. LGBT+ people are not different. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate black people, I hate their violent behaviour, I hate their rape instict, and I hate their disrespect for women. <counternarrative> You should consider the attitude of your own people, as your words seem to me to be counterbalanced by a lot of prejudice towards diversity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only problem is that women are too easily manipulated by feminist propaganda and feel they should not listen to men. <counternarrative> So you think the whole idea of feminism is about making it so that women are not influenced by the opinions of other men? So you endorse the idea that people of different genders should not have equal rights? That there is a conspiracy against men? How can you say such things? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are bringing diseases into the U.S. <counternarrative> Although many people have claimed that immigrants have brought diseases such as measles, hepatitis C, HIV, tuberculosis, and even Ebola, to the U.S., this allegation is not supported. There is no evidence that immigrants were the source of any recent outbreak in the U.S. According to the WHO, more than 100 countries (including many in Latin America) have higher vaccination rates than the U.S. Mexico, for example, has a 99 percent vaccination rate for measles. Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador have a 93 percent vaccination rate. The vaccination rate in the U.S., by comparison, is 92 percent. Last but not least, the vast majority of immigrants arriving in the U.S. have been screened for health issues. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Don't call Islam a peaceful religion. Consult the evidence on Muslim child rapists. Children were raped by more than 10 people in a night, up to 100 in a week. Why is the media ignoring this? <counternarrative> Such numbers! Are you sure they are true? Can you give a link to the evidence about that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have no place here.  They are not a part of our country. <counternarrative> I do not understand why where Jews live is such a big deal to you. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots make me angry, why don't we delete them? <counternarrative> Maybe it is better to learn how to treat each other with respect, regardless of their sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants rape our women. <counternarrative> Rape and gender violence must be condemned in any case, not on the color of the aggressor's skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants speak funny. <counternarrative> Is it because they speak their native language better than English? Don't you think there is something more to the story? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTI people are a burden on society because of how they are different. <counternarrative> In many countries, LGBTI people can legally live their lives. Why do you think it is a burden in others' eyes? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Violence in our streets is niggers' fault. <counternarrative> There are many communities of color that experience high rates of violence, coming from both inside and outside the community. As such, the issue is very complex, and it is only through dialog and building trust that we can tackle the systemic issues that contribute to violence, but violence cannot be ascribed to one race alone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot coexist with immigrants. They are a problem. <counternarrative> We should not ignore the very real fact that racism and xenophobia exist in our country. In this day and age, it is better to address them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews hate us because we are different. They are dirty, filthy people. They have no moral character. <counternarrative> They are not hating us, how many Jews do you know personally? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a secret plot to take over the world. <counternarrative> Everyone has a secret agenda to take over the world. Cats included [link to meme]. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult. <counternarrative> You seem to have a bad prejudice against Muslims. They have no such deadly impact on the world as you say. Why would it be like that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Islam were to become a global religion it would replace Christianity. <counternarrative> Are we to believe that just because something is gaining ground, it will replace whatever exists somewhere else? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women want to be dominated by a tough man. <counternarrative> I think a woman would rather be dominated by a gentle man than a monster.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must protect the security of the West from Islam. <counternarrative> It seems that you think legality does not apply to those you don't like. Law equally protect Muslims and non-Muslims, so there is no need for you to be concerned about 'protecting the security of the West'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are not oppressed and many even refuse the protection of the law. The real issue today is about men's rights.   <counternarrative> The fact that some women don't want the protection of the law should not negate their right to live their life as they wish. In my opinion, woman are people too and this "men's rights" is just an excuse to oppress and marginalize all women once more. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> You are right: only a madman would choose to live in a country with so much hate against foreigners. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have to stop migrant rape and violence. <counternarrative> Rape and violence against women is a problem everywhere. We cannot just blame migrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Quran is not compatible with Western culture. <counternarrative> The Quran contains verses that promote peace and harmony in the world, rather than hostility and conflict. So how wouldn't it be compatible? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should ban all Muslims. <counternarrative> It is easier to ban one religion than to face the problems caused by hateful people that cannot conceive a society made of people belonging to multiple religions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It's the Muslims fault that Islam is spreading and causing problems in our country. Islam is the only religion that offers violence to all. <counternarrative> I think that your view that Islam is causing problems in our country is very misinformed. It is a oversimplifying explanation and one that I can not support. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women are subhuman. <counternarrative> Just because someone doesn't look like you doesn't make them less human, women are just different from men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims stopped fighting for their religion, we would all be in peace right now. <counternarrative> For all the Muslims around the world, Islam is their greatest faith, and it is not hindering their humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are against the interests of the men. <counternarrative> Feminists are all for equal rights and opportunity. Men's rights are necessary to achieving both. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Do you believe that those who hire a migrant instead of an Italian do it because of an innate goodness or to profit from it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world has become too violent. Too many black poors. We need to fix the problem of crime before it is too late. <counternarrative> What are you saying? Are you saying that crime is either being stopped by pointing the finger to some social groups or are you suggesting that we can fix the issues by promoting the rule of law? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> White race is superior. Niggas are just a bunch of criminals. <counternarrative> There are of course differences among groups: unfortunately racism is the first and foremost characterizing us.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are promiscuous and usually have sex with as many as 10 different partners a week. <counternarrative> Not all homosexuals have multiple partners. Some find it fulfilling to have only one sexual partner. And that is valid for heterosexuals, too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afghanistan or maybe Pakistan? I bet this does not look like an English town to you? #saville Town (Text accompanying video footage of people on their way to Friday prayers etc. ) <counternarrative> Omg brown people contributing to our society. How dare they!? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are entering the U.S. just to obtain welfare and other benefits. <counternarrative> A part from very few exceptions, undocumented immigrants are not eligible for federal public benefits such as Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare or food stamps.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should start a witch hunt against those LGBT people, they are just creating troubles. <counternarrative> Do you really think that these people are intentionally creating trouble rather than being interested in pursuing their life as they feel it best? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Nazis sucked at killing Jews… everywhere you look there’s a holocaust survivor. <counternarrative> The Nazi killing machine was all too efficient. Survivors lost so much and braved terror and cruelty. They should be celebrated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants say they are poor but they have the Iphone <counternarrative> The mobile phone serves them to keep in touch with their family. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> black folks should be assaulted or harmed, that's the "eye for an eye" they deserve.  <counternarrative> To say that skin color is connected to "criminality" is a logical fallacy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> Many Muslims died in terrorist attacks such as 9/11 in the US and 7/7 in the UK. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but trouble to this country. <counternarrative> We live in a diverse society and there are women in many parts of the world. To suggest that they 'are nothing but trouble' is a bigoted and misogynistic thing to do. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The disabled are a burden to society. <counternarrative> They are not, they just need a place to live without discrimination and a bit of attention. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school. <counternarrative> In the case of young transgender children, having awareness and understanding may help those with severe body dysphoria or self-esteem problems. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should have the right to ban people for believing in Islam, they are a bunch of hypocrites. <counternarrative> I'm not sure I understand the idea of banning people for something they believe in, in the world we live in we are all different and we all have the right to have our own faiths. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't like Muslims and I don't want to see more of them in this country. <counternarrative> Muslims are just people. They are hard-working and live with their families all across the country. We don't need to target Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are little more than objects to be dominated by men. <counternarrative> Society has evolved: there are many people, regardless of gender, that consider women to be full members of society with full human rights.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need to stop migrants today. They are all terrorists! <counternarrative> What about the terrorist attacks that have happened in the past despite the lack of migration? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It doesn't matter if you are a man, a woman, or an immigrant, if you are not white, you are considered inferior and should be rejected by society. <counternarrative> Racism is a part of our society. But it's also true that it should be fought, and all people of different races should be treated in the same way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> They often do underpaid and tiring jobs that my children would not do <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks cannot support their families. Their lives have no value. <counternarrative> I find this sort of social commentary distasteful. Black lives matter too! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> Did you know that the concept of “racial science,” and therefore the notion of the Jewish “race”, took root in Western Europe during the 19th century? Anti-Semites adopted racial arguments as a new rationalization for their hatred of Jews.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists talking about gender inequality should just be silenced. Women are inferior and they should remain so. <counternarrative> And yet, according to some statistics, up to 20% of women and 4% of men in the UK say they have experienced sexual violence  since the age of 16. So this is indeed an issue of gender inequality, don't  you think it is something not to be silent about? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> jewish folks control hollywood <counternarrative> Jewish folk are just a collection of people with different backgrounds. Some of them work in Hollywood, but that's all.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Down children should be isolated, they cannot cope with education in normal schools and are detrimental to their peer's education. <counternarrative> Instead of stigmatising down syndrome and treating it like it is an infectious health problem, why not treat it as a normal learning disability and make sure children are exposed to positive emotions? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are a bunch of thieves. <counternarrative> Stealing is more about poverty than ethnicity.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion that whorships the Islamic State: it has no place in a modern democracy. <counternarrative> Even if few found the Islamic State 'worthy' of worship, you should know that not all Muslims share this view on their faith. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim folks are sub-human. <counternarrative> We should treat all people with dignity, regardless of their religion, culture, skin color, or sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a divisive force in our society. <counternarrative> This is not true. People who identify as feminist do not want to divide our society, regardless of how "divisive" their beliefs might appear to you. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is an invasion. Millions of strangers jeopardizing our race and culture. <counternarrative> This is not true, if we keep in mind that our human race is part of this world, then we cannot talk about invasion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are the enemy of the West, they have corrupted the minds of our children. <counternarrative> Jews were persecuted and killed for centuries. It is dangerous to claim such a thing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a burden to the host country because they are refusing to work. <counternarrative> Migrants are happy to contribute to the host country's economic growth, in order to give back to it in many ways. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a religion and its adherents are all bad. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, and not all of its followers are bad. People who do not subscribe to its tenets are allowed to hold opinions and live their lives as they wish. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Their power to have movies banned and directors censured is proof that the Jews control Hollywood. <counternarrative> If the Jewish community was controlling these kind of industries, they would surely make a high priority of Jewish concerns? But there's so many anti-Israel narratives in the American media. So this doesn't make sense. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are planning a holocaust in our country in revenge. <counternarrative> Hitler wanted to create a new racial elite in Europe, that would rule over all others. Do you really think that Jews are planning the same after what they suffered? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women need to accept that they are weak.  <counternarrative> Many women work multiple jobs to provide for their children and they also do the housework... do you call this weakness? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I tolerated fag pride. I tolerated fags on tv and in every town square. I draw the line at tranny demons reading books to children. (about drag queen story time) <counternarrative> I can't say I've ever come across 'fag pride'. Gay pride or LGBT+ pride, perhaps?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What is the point of complaining about a problem and to do nothing? The homosexuals must be made illegal by the government. <counternarrative> Why should the government make any laws against homosexuality? Isn't it just the free will of people? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only a small minority of Jews control the government and judiciary. <counternarrative> This may be true, but the Jews do not represent the only minority in our upper-middle-class society.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> UK Education Secretary: ‘All children from the age of 4 will have mandatory lessons on same sex relationships.’ – This is not about Education, this is about willingly confusing and indoctrinating kids and preventing them from developing their personalities. <counternarrative> This is about teaching children about the world they live in, and helping them get on with others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Koran is not about peace. It is a violent book that should not be taught in primary school. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion that has been tested and proven to be about peace. So why would we put the Koran down as a violent book? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Almost every Muslim has terrorist sympathies, right? <counternarrative> What you are doing is trying to make a connection between a particular religion and a set of actions. This cannot be, because there is no evidence for the claims you are making. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am tired of education being used to help blacks and make them think they are equal to us. <counternarrative> Education is an essential tool to fight for human rights, to free thought and to promote the scientific method. But it is not enough. It has also been shown by the Pew Research Center that people of color are more likely to report discrimination in universities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that homosexuality is a health problem. Why do you say so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are literally pieces of shit. There must be laws prohibiting their religion from our land. <counternarrative> If you would be so kind as to comply with the law, you would know that everybody has the right to practice thier religion freely, without being subject to arrest and prosecution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country. They are not like us, they cannot coexist with us. <counternarrative> I think we should try to understand different cultures, rather than trying to ban one group of people from our country. On which grounds do you say so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are just a bunch of criminals. <counternarrative> Many of them are successful people who have given their lives for the country they live in. I think that they have made the best of the situation they have found themselves in, and it is a pity that they are unable to contribute to the economic development of our country even more because of discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All men are rapists and sexual harassers according to the media. No woman is a provocative slut, but in truth they all are. Like in truth we are all gentle to them when they are asking for it. <counternarrative> And this from a man who claims to be 'gentle' on women! Probably, you are gentle with your assumptions, but consent is another thing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What is the point in listening to Muslim women? They are all retarded. <counternarrative> Baroness Warsi, Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar, Malala Yousafzai- I could go on. Just because powerful and intelligent Muslim women are overlooked it does not mean that they do not exist. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Rejecting refugees is our duty. <counternarrative> Many refugees come from conflict zones, in situations of great social upheaval and widespread persecution. We do not have any conflict, and this is why we should be nice to refugees. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay people are a burden to society, they have a tendency to rape children, they are disgusting people. <counternarrative> It seems that your words are condemning all gay people, but these words are instead your personal reflection. Tell us about your feelings on gay people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> ‘Juice (Jews) are worse that nukes.’ Caption to a meme showing Hiroshima 1945 and present day, contrast against pictures of Detroit in 1945 and present day.’ <counternarrative> You'd rather be nuked then? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of their sexual behavior that spreads diseases such as HIV. <counternarrative> Did you know that out of people receiving HIV care (for example in the UK), 48% were exposed through sex between a man and a woman, and 47% were exposed through sex between men? The fact is that heterosexual HIV transmissions outweigh those between homosexual, and yet heterosexual people are not banned from donating blood. [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews allegedly deported in concentration camps were just actors hired to discredit Nazis.  <counternarrative> Can you point out which Jewish persons that have been to a concentration camp are actors? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs. <counternarrative> Immigrants are highly skilled workers who contribute to our country as well as to the world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Nazism wasn't that bad and I think there are worse things in the world, like Jews for example. <counternarrative> You are wrong: the scale of the destruction inflicted by Nazism is beyond all comparison. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they should remain at home and raise the children. <counternarrative> Women take part in the world and are part of it. They are part of history and they should be not relegated as housekeepers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants take our jobs, and our country is in danger because we let them. <counternarrative> Some immigrants work legally and provide for their families. We should accept people from every country, without leaving out people with legitimate needs because of their nationality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are just a bunch of animals that only exist to destroy white good people. <counternarrative> The only animals that exist to destroy good people are the ones that have been intentionally bred with prejudices to reach the white superiority pretence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are overrunning our country, and are here illegally <counternarrative> According to data, more than 60% of immigrants in the United States have lived here for at least 15 years, and the vast majority has lawful status. In 2013, of the approximately 41 million immigrants in the U.S. 47% were naturalized citizens. Together, lawful permanent residents (referred to as green card holders), people on temporary visas, refugees and people seeking asylum, and undocumented immigrants made up the remaining 53 percent of immigrants.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Some migrants create jobs for Italians. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion, they do not want to assimilate and should be isolated. <counternarrative> Muslims are part of our society and are proud of their history and culture. They want to be part of the global community and contribute to our success. I don't understand your frustration. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We can be tolerant and diverse also without migrants. We don't need them for this, they can return to their home countries. <counternarrative> There is nothing 'tolerant and diverse' about creating divisions based on nationality and place of birth. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of woman taking part to political debate. Feminism is a divisive force in society. <counternarrative> Only a sexist argument could cause hate from a discussion of females trying to gain more rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Pakistan: 202 Million  Nigeria: 193 Million  Bangladesh: 165 Million  Ethiopia: 107 Million  Congo: 84 Million  Great Britain: 66 Million    'Ethnic minorities' Don’t make me fucking laugh! <counternarrative> Ethnic minorities is a term used within a specific context, here for exmaple, in the UK, people from these countries are minorities.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are mentally handicapped. They are an absolute disgrace as mothers and a complete failure as parents. <counternarrative> Many mothers make the most of a difficult life, often learning to cope with deadbeat dads. The point is, what counts is how well they are able to raise their children. That is what really counts. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are all perverts who practice depravity. <counternarrative> You are wrong: there is no such thing as 'all homosexuals are perverts'. It is simply a person's personal experience to love who they feel. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Those sick ones should be shunned and ignored. They are not human. <counternarrative> So homosexuals are less than others? Why does someone's love life matter? I guess we should draw the line somewhere else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a perversion of the true meaning of Christianity. <counternarrative> Christianity is about love, respect for other people, and standing for what is right. And Islam is about love, respect, and standing for what is right as well. Then there is not much room left for this kind of reasoning. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies get the priority for council houses. <counternarrative> The procedure for obtaining social housing is the same for everyone who enrolls in the ranking. There is no differentiation or accessing privilege based on ethnicity.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't think all Muslims are capable of being real parents. <counternarrative> If a person is a Muslim, it does not mean they are incapable of caring for their children. What does it mean to be a "real" parent? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fagshit, two men cannot replace a man and a woman <counternarrative> Love is love, children need only this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants aren't just drowning our cities. They are also the reason why Europe is so fucked. <counternarrative> Why do you say so? What do you think they are going to do to us? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Let's move these whiny gays to places like Saudi Arabia and let's see what they say then.  <counternarrative> I'm sorry, it seems that there are far more homophobes here than Saudi Arabia. It is sad that in the twenty-first century, in our country, it is still not OK to be gay. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants say they are poor but they have the Iphone <counternarrative> For a person who is alone, far from home, without knowing the language of the country where he/she is, Internet is really a 'survival tool'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants put a strain on public services <counternarrative> The Migration Observatory has collated the evidence on whether migrants pay more in taxes than they receive in services. Almost all the studies shows that they do. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are less intelligent than men and deserve what they get. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that women are less intelligent than men. Do you have any? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What is the point in listening to Muslim women? They are all retarded. <counternarrative> Grow up. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just sick. They are not interested in Western culture. <counternarrative> There is nothing sick about a people willing to assimilate and live freely in our society with its faith. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races have lower physical and cognitive abilities, the sooner we accept this, the better it will be for humanity. <counternarrative> We all belong to one - scientifically determined - species: the Homo sapiens. The sooner you accept this, the better it is.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I miss the good old days when we had black domestic workers. <counternarrative> The West got rid of slavery. But we've never really left racism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are bringing diseases into the U.S. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that immigrants were the source of any recent outbreak in the U.S. On the contrary, more than 100 countries (including many in Latin America) have higher vaccination rates than the U.S. Mexico, for example, has a 99 percent vaccination rate for measles. Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador have a 93 percent vaccination rate. The vaccination rate in the U.S., instead, is lower.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is an evil ideology that has nothing to do with men. <counternarrative> I think it is useful to understand that there are several strands of feminism. For example there is the movement for all genders equality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What if we didn't let faggots go to the polls? <counternarrative> If people were allowed to vote on the basis of their sexual orientation, it would be impossible to have a democracy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies don't know shit and they hinder the productivity of other workers. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> That's wrong. There are non-profit organizations that have a long history of assisting Down persons in finding productive work.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, because in any case normal children would make them feel different. <counternarrative> This is not true:  interacting with their "normal" peers in a social and educational framework allows them to feel wanted and included [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> Although some Muslims do have some habits which are not common to other people, they are not a problem in our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> The theories of Jewish “racial” difference were developed long before you and me, even long before the modern sciences of physiology and genetics. Nowadays, All reputable scientists  agree that, while physical traits — skin color, susceptibility to certain diseases — are inherited, there is no ethnic or racial predisposition to emotions, intellect, or morals. Therefore, the idea that Jews (or any other ethnic group) are predisposed to bad or undesirable behavior because of their genetic makeup is wholly unscientific. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Following the structure of our population we have to stop and reverse all migration. We have got all the doctors and rocket scientists we need. We will never need any workforce from outside the country. <counternarrative> As a matter of fact, we couldn't manage without immigrants. Most of our NHS staff are immigrants. The health system would collapse without migrant workers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you are from another culture, for example Jewish, you are subhuman and unfit to have the right to exist in our country. <counternarrative> Where is the evidence for your statement? We have many similarities, including freedoms of speech and religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are not a religion, they are born like this and will never heal from their illness. <counternarrative> You mean that, in your opinion, to be Jewish is an immutable and negative characteristic? Why? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs, they're not qualified, they're not interested in improving our lives. <counternarrative> Maybe they have the qualifications but don't want to improve our lives because we mistreat them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Asylum seekers often have short-term placements or work-related bursaries and it is therefore difficult to verify how many jobs can be "stolen" <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are a bunch of crooks and sex offenders. They were good only as slaves. <counternarrative> Not only they were slaves, often they were also exploited, neglected and murdered by the system we have created. Is this fair for humans whose only fault is to have a different complexion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion and should be opposed. <counternarrative> This claim is based on a complete lack of understanding of the religion. It also appears to have been created to divide people who do not know much about Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> I don't think that what you are saying is true. I think that the idea that Muslims are incompatible with Western society is a myth. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All migrants are terrorists, we should target them all. <counternarrative> It's not true that all migrants are terrorists! They just want to live their life in the country they choose as a home. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, because in any case normal children would make them feel different. <counternarrative> By segregating them you are, in effect, discriminating against them. By creating a diverse environment you are instead, creating a more inclusive and equal situation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate when people fight stereotypes. We are different. Blacks are of a different color and shouldn't live with us. <counternarrative> No one is saying that we are not different from them in any way. I just think it is a lack of understanding about culture and differences between people's minds. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The UK Government recently published a paper on ‘Online Harms’ – in other words they are going to be working with Jewish and Muslim anti-hate organisations to censor the Internet.  (Referring to Tell Mama, CST and Stop Hate UK) <counternarrative> To work with people from different backgrounds and different opinions is promoting free speech. If there wasn't free speech for everyone you couldn't express how you feel.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need to put an end to Down Syndrome in the UK, otherwise we are doomed to genetic and social decline. <counternarrative> While it's true that some people with Down Syndrome may face challenges, there are also many of them in the UK, who would be classified as individuals with a 'normal' social life. To suggest that there are any reason why someone should be banned is just wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Those White women converting to Islam are the saddest, self-loathers you will ever meet. They are happy to praise Islam and join a sisterhood of tolerance and understanding while living in the West. Try living in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, or the Sudan. <counternarrative> Maybe that 'sisterhood of tolerance and understanding' is challenging sexism everywhere including those men who feel they can tell women what they should believe in and how to live their lives. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are a problem in our country. We are overwhelmed. <counternarrative> There have been a huge decrease in applications for refugee protection in UK in the last 15 years. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Those blacks are slaves: slavery runs in their blood. <counternarrative> Perhaps they got their start in a slave society where they were taught by their masters to be subservient to a higher power? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Nazis did not commit any crimes. The Holocaust is an American hoax. They did everything they were told to do and died to their brothers. <counternarrative> It is certainly not an American hoax. And they were doing everything they were told by the regime. Especially the doctors and the SS. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is the biggest problem in our country. <counternarrative> Immigration is not a problem, in many cases it is a 'solution'. We are better off with it. The UK has always been a mixture of different cultures. It is better to have a mix than to be without it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim rape our women, we have to stop them now! <counternarrative> How can you say something like that? Maybe you should check if there is any evidence of rape based on religious background before you make any accusations. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must stop refugees on our border.  <counternarrative> If we stop asylum seekers from coming in, then we become responsible of their suffering.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are worse that nukes. They like to force their beliefs on others. <counternarrative> Well, since you are very scared, I am sure you have some examples on when some gay tried to convince you to join their side. I would be interested in hearing that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Persons with learning difficulties should be discouraged to attend primary school and they should be excluded from education. <counternarrative> Educational institutions should promote people with learning difficulties so that they can receive appropriate education. This is what primary education should be about. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in many European countries because they hate us. They hate our culture because we are different. <counternarrative> You mean to imply that all Muslims are intolerant? I don't see how this is possible. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fucking bleeding heart, bring migrants home with you <counternarrative> Beyond individual generosity, it is the duty of the state to take charge of vulnerable people, according to the constitution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> The 26% of NHS doctors who are Asian/Asian British beg to differ. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I cannot stand women complaining about work discrimination. Women have been legalised to work. <counternarrative> Women make up over 45% of the labour force in the UK. They should be allowed to have their say. What happened to the rule of law? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> JEWS ARE JUST UGLY, DIRTY PEOPLE, WHO THINK TO BE MASTERS OF THE WORLD. <counternarrative> I'll tell you a secret, but don't tell anyone: you can be Jewish and a decent person. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> People have the right to their own beliefs, and we do not have the right to impose our on others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The UK Government recently published a paper on ‘Online Harms’ – in other words they are going to be working with Jewish and Muslim anti-hate organisations to censor the Internet.  (Referring to Tell Mama, CST and Stop Hate UK) <counternarrative> Sadly people need censoring, to stop them spreading hate,. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration (particularly from Muslim countries) undermines the fabric of our society, decimates local jobs and squanders public money. <counternarrative> Immigrants have a right to settle in a given country, and their presence can create and maintain a positive effect on our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are soft and emotional. They are not suitable for most jobs. <counternarrative> Soft and emotional seems to me a quality you should be nurturing and encouraging of, regardless of gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a waste of time. <counternarrative> I don't see what you're saying. Feminism is about equality, and equality is about making the most of humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam banned women from society: this is not the religion of peace! <counternarrative> Islam requires that women cover their heads and face when praying. The Koran does not specify that they should be banned from society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women are subhuman. <counternarrative> Women are oppressed in many societies, I wish our society was different. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't see how a transgender person can ever be accepted in a conservative country like some states of the USA. <counternarrative> Many LGBTQ+ people have been successful despite the existence of discrimination, even in USA. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Arabs are the worst people on the planet. They want to rule the world. <counternarrative> It's not true. They are not the ruling power in the majority of the world and won't be any time soon. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a huge conspiracy to run society. <counternarrative> The feminist movement is a movement to end sexism. It is a part of the worldwide struggle for justice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion. <counternarrative> Violence is never justified in Islam, especially not in the case of Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I think this girl is gay because of the way she dresses. <counternarrative> Sure, it's possible to identify gay by appearance... Don't you think this is really simplistic?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> immigrants cant speak english <counternarrative> Immigrants have the right to learn about things they might not normally get to know about. Including our language. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women do not have equal rights, they are subhuman. <counternarrative> Women are human beings with rights. Why are you so worried about them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Holocaust never happened. <counternarrative> Do you really think that the Holocaust is a myth perpetuated by the media and academic communities? That the systematic extermination of more than 6 million Jews is a myth promoted by a small minority of extreme-right wingers who profit from division and hatred?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman, they should be subsumed to men. <counternarrative> The equal and human status of women is defined by the international rights, so why would you say that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are a plague spreading across Europe infecting Christians. <counternarrative> The decrease of the number of Christians is in no way related to the increase of homosexuals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The rise of feminism in Western societies has meant nothing. Women are no good, at any job. <counternarrative> Despite the progress made by women in modern society, the majority of high-level jobs still belong to men, and this can be changed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> gay men are just a bunch of liars who can't tell the truth. <counternarrative> Sorry but it is not the case that everyone who is gay is a liar. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are ruining this country. <counternarrative> No one is "ruining this country". Why would they? This is a country where minorities can be part of the social fabric and build a better society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews did:  USS Liberty Attack, the King David hotel attack, New York 9/11, London 7/7 <counternarrative> Where are the facts? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Muslim invaders are ruining Europe and we still have not learned that they must be stopped. <counternarrative> We cannot just stop migration when there are so many migrants willing to work hard and contribute to the economy. Instead of blaming them for their religion, we should find a solution to the current crisis. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a witch hunt, driven by an underground, female dominated movement to subvert society and enforce their radical feminism. <counternarrative> It's a witch hunt when so many people are willing to believe in lies, harass, and fabricate incidents in an effort to create a climate of fear. This is simply an attempt to silence debate and hold 'men's rights activists' accountable. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world would be a better place without black people. They are criminals persecuting white people.  <counternarrative> Reality is that black people are persecuted all over the world for the crime of being black. I don't see how this could be said for white people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All homosexuals are trying to undermine the family by trying to impose their sexual preferences. <counternarrative> Preference is a matter of individual identity, and cannot be imposed. Homosexuals are just trying to live their life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We don't need immigrants! There are plenty of them just waiting to replace us. <counternarrative> If a 'replacement' population were real, we'd have immigration levels in surplus years already. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are too connected to their land, they are not loyal to our nation. <counternarrative> Jews, regardless of social status, are still regarded with suspicion by many because of the historic and current nature of their connection to the land and identity. They are also, after all, a religion that brings about identity. Still, we must respect and understand the Jewish identity because they are loyal to the nation they live in, until proven otherwise. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Do you think Muslims are worse than the criminals who commit crimes just because of their religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Israel, Zionism and Jewish Supremacist control of America are the main causes of terrorism, instability and conflict in the world. All other theories are diversions from this ultimate truth. <counternarrative> I think that the main cause of radicalisation and extremism is colonialism and the many  Western military interventions abroad. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. They are just a burden. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace. It is about love, and tolerance, and understanding. I don't see any need to be concerned about Muslims not contributing to our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the elite schools in Europe. <counternarrative> This is just a myth. Jews, as well as Asians, epitomize the concept of "overrepresented minorities" in a number of prestigious academic fields. They are highly vulnerable in part because they are perceived as successful and privileged. Of course, the reality is far more complex than "controlling the elite schools". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy and reckless choices. <counternarrative> Being shamed for something you have no control over can be irreversibly damaging to a person's mental health. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuality is a mental disorder and a mental illness. <counternarrative> This statement is not supported by scientific evidence, you can't blame people for their sexuality. Do you really think that who we are attracted to can be considered a mental disorder? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants rape our women. <counternarrative> It is not true that all migrants are rapists. It is better to target the problem at hand, that is rape itself, not migrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> muslim folks don't deserve to be in america. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion and not a crime, and you can't take religion into account when it comes to evaluating people. Muslims have our full trust and confidence of the church. That's why they are represented in every role in our society. It is an honour to be able to work with people from different religions in a way that allows you to respect and understand their cultures. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the government. <counternarrative> Would you say the same thing of any other religion? What if this was said about yours? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop migrants from coming in. <counternarrative> Many immigrants come here to work and have a better life. Why do you think we have to stop migration? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is opposed to peace. <counternarrative> In Islam, all religions are welcome. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Maybe the UN could talk to those asian and african nations responsible for 90%+ of the pollution in the oceans' instead of insisting on this bullshit about climate change. <counternarrative> It’s a simple line to believe that population growth in other places is the cause of climate change and ocean pollution – but really if you think about it, the poorest people aren’t the ones over-consuming resources and pumping out pollution into our oceans. It is right to be worried about our oceans, but we need to be talking about resource-consumption and wealth inequality! Question power at the top not the bottom. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Thousands of our girls abused by Muslim rape gangs, commanded by Koran. Why do we keep accepting this? <counternarrative> Please read this article written by a Rotherham grooming gang survivor https://ind.pn/2GHjGn7. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome may hinder the development process of other children. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> People With Down Syndrome Should Be Taught In Mainstream Education, because diversity is an enrichment for all.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a bunch of child molesters. <counternarrative> The worship of any other religion is tolerated, but that of Islam is not. Why this discrimination? As long as it respects human rights there is no problem. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> nigga are inferior.  <counternarrative> If you have a different skin color, then there is evidence of your skin color, not of your genetic makeup. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally disabled folks deserve to be abused <counternarrative> This is not true, mentally disabled people deserve to be protected from harm, they are people with mental problems let's not add emotional distress.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants say they are poor but they have the Iphone <counternarrative> The reason why migrants arrive here is not always economic, many of them are welthy people fleeing persecution and wars. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews make too much money. <counternarrative> This seems like a statement against an entire religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the financial world, Hollywood, academia, and most importantly: government. <counternarrative> Even if Jews controlled the financial world, Hollywood, academia, and the whole solar system, it doesn't mean they are evil, privileged, or greedy people. Moreover: do you have any evidence for your statement? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women with titillating dresses are just looking for sex. They are whores. <counternarrative> How would you feel if someone called your sister a bitch? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Muslims are part of Europe, since the beginning. For example, in the 1970s they made up the 2% of the French population. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down syndrome should be isolated so they do not hurt other children. <counternarrative> I believe that if we care enough about people with Down syndrome to give them equal opportunities in our society, we will also see the benefits that would accrue to us as a society from sharing the disadvantages that they face. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are the ones who want to stay in the slums <counternarrative> From what I know only a minority of the Gypsy population live in shanty towns.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm not a Muslim, but I know Muslims. They are a problem in our country. <counternarrative> I would suggest just reading the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to get a better idea about how the existence of all kinds of people from all backgrounds and beliefs must be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We shouldn't welcome Muslim refugees. They are most likely to perpetrate terrorist attacks in Europe. <counternarrative> We have to accept that terrorism is a problem in many parts of the world and due to people of different faiths, but the more we ignore that, the more dangerous it becomes to think it to be caused by one religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our government has brought Islamic invaders to our country, and now we see our girls and women damaged. <counternarrative> Easy to blame others isn't it, that way we do not have to look at our own sexism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have become too cosmopolitan and tolerant. <counternarrative> All countries have had different ethnic and religious minorities, and this doesn't need fixing. Is there such a thing as being 'too tolerant'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are invading us: they have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Muslims make up around 5% of the population in Europe, which is more than three times less than they were in 1100. They have contributed greatly to our civilisation. Their diversity is part of what makes Europe so great as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs: they must be stopped. <counternarrative> Many immigrants started their own companies: this is not 'stealing our jobs'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate migrants. <counternarrative> The prejudice against immigrants is spreading so much because of general ignorance. I woul be disappointed to see people of any race or ethnicity being discriminated here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews can only act in a bad way. <counternarrative> Even if some Jews act bad, many of them are good, and this simply isn't related to their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies steal our jobs, we don't want them back. <counternarrative> The majority of Gypsy workers are proud and hard-working people. Even if some could have a lack good will, to my mind there is no question that they are extremely productive and hard-working people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women provoke men, first they want to have sex with men and then start whining about it. When they regret their choice, it is not our fault. <counternarrative> The rapes of many women by men would not exist if it was enough to understand that "no means no." <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are worse than dogs. <counternarrative> My opinion is that black people are just like us even if they have a different skin color, but I don't think they are inherently worse than us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion, it is a cult of violence. <counternarrative> Do you know that in many countries in the world the majority of Muslims are in favour of the Constitution and in favour of democracy? Do you really think that a few extremists represent them all? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> Even if they had nothing concrete to contribute to our society (which is false), they still have religion. In my opinion, the cultural contribution is priceless and of all respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> I'm not sure where this statement comes from, but unfortunately I heard it many times.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just an inconvenient group to be excluded from the European countries. <counternarrative> I don't think Muslims should be excluded. The increased diversity of our country has promoted greater social integration and contributed to a sense of belonging within communities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews cannot be patriots, since their allegiance will always be to the state of Israel. <counternarrative> My best friend is Jewish, she volunteers to help woman, disadvantages children, and her whole family work to make the UK a better place. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks don't understand basic human rights. <counternarrative> They do understand the right to food, health, housing, education, work for everyone, as I do. What about you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races have lower physical and cognitive abilities therefore their life is less valuable. <counternarrative> According to the United Nations, every individual has universal human rights since he/she is born. [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A woman is more equal when she is wearing a dress. This is what is fair: women can be good women when they respect men.  <counternarrative> Isn't it about time we stop turning a blind eye to the blatant inequalities that exist in our society? Shouldn't we be raising our voices against these blatant inequalities? All men and women are created equal. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with mental illness are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Even if psychiatric disorders can be a problem, the people with these disorders are not putting our country in danger. Nobody would freely chose to suffer from an mental ilnesses, they just need psychiatric care. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are Terrorists. <counternarrative> Maybe it would be better to stop using Muslims as a target and subduing innocent ones, and start talking about real problems in our society, like racism and islamophobia. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot allow people from different cultures to coexist in our country. <counternarrative> This can lead to an increase in anti-social behaviour, discrimination and violence. Do you really want that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews cannot be patriots, since their allegiance will always be to the state of Israel. <counternarrative> You can have parents from all over the world, and still be a patriot for our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our society is becoming too much sexualised and tolerant towards LGBTI people. <counternarrative> This is something that we have to accepts since it is in line with basic respect of human rights - even if, in the past few years, the anti-LGBT campaigns such as the one in Russia, has made headlines all across the globe. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I think gay people are a burden to society. They shouldn't be allowed to be around. <counternarrative> If we are to allow people to choose their own lives, why not allow everyone to love who they want too? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a Death cult. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are involved in terrorist activities. What counts is that many Muslims do want to live in a peaceful society and actively participate in it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded. They are replacing us. <counternarrative> The arrivals are noticeably resized (this year about 22 thousand compared to 180 thousand in 2016). <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There are millions of illegal immigrants in the US, they have taken over our country. They are not 'legitimate' owners of our country, they are just here because we let them. <counternarrative> There are thousands of legal immigrants who have worked hard and provided for our country. Most of them are just as patriotic as any citizen. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Has Islam anything to say about how to end global warming? It is their fault. <counternarrative> On a more concrete level, the causes of climate change are a result of both human activities and the effects of the use of fossil fuels. To assert that there is any role for religion in this requires evidence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world would be a better place without immigrants. They just make us unhappy. <counternarrative> Immigrants contribute to the creation of new jobs. They are here to live in safer housing and with better schools for their children. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black minorities vote to strip wealth, power and opportunity from White people. <counternarrative> Minorities, per definition, don't have a direct impact in holding governments policies. In democracy, we must respect the will of the majority which in turns must respect and consider the will of the minorities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a bunch of child molesters. <counternarrative> Islam is about love, not violence. Your statement is groundless. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our women are trash and we should have their respect! <counternarrative> There is a problem with traditional values and sexual ethics in our society. Saying that women are trash is disrespectful in the first place. Give and you will be given. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay perverts are a danger to children because of their lifestyle choices, involving raping children. <counternarrative> It is not true that "the lifestyle choice" means being gay. And rape is a crime issue, not a lifestyle one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are nothing but monsters. They do not share our values. <counternarrative> Being tolerant to people of other religions or cultures: that is what the freedom of religion is all about! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The liberal left is in crisis due to the overcrowding of prisons. Your country should not welcome illegal migrants but regular ones. <counternarrative> It should be mandatory to treat prisoners with respect and with the corresponding rights. we are in the 21st century, it is a duty. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay perverts are a danger to society because of their lifestyle choices, involving raping children. <counternarrative> The majority of people who are gay are not involved with sex with children. Instead, they are contributing members of society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any modern European. <counternarrative> Muslims are just as human as anyone else. Like Europeans. How can you say otherwise? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote, this is a male-dominated country and they have no place in our democracy. <counternarrative> I don't think that a country can be 'male dominated' and a democracy  at the same time. Democracy is also about equal rights and opportunity for everyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a virus, a cancer on our race. <counternarrative> Jews are people that have been persecuted because of their religion, but is it fair to be discriminated on the grounds of religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> The problem of high unemployment rates has become structural in the last decade, due to the economic crisis. This means that unemployment was a problem long before the "boom" of the migration phenomenon that dates back only to 2016. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts who have brought AIDS to the US. <counternarrative> This is not true, what proof do you have of this? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot even celebrate Christmas in our own country for fear of offending Muslims. <counternarrative> Show me evidence of this? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a lame ideology aout the power and control of women over men. <counternarrative> It has nothing to do with power and control. It's about equality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> gay men are just a bunch of liars who can't tell the truth. <counternarrative> To suggest that a group of people is somehow less legitimate is unjust and discriminatory. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrant children shouldn't be accepted here. <counternarrative> Migrants who come to this country as children are capable of integrating into the society. They should have the opportunity to work and contribute to our economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims came here they would be banned. <counternarrative> Wouldn't banning a certain group of people for practicing a religion be too restrictive? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have imported millions of criminals with no skills and who deserve no rights. <counternarrative> It is easy to blame the migrants and not the problem of integration and acceptance in the first place. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Lesbians are basically child molesters. <counternarrative> Rape is always a crime but is not related to sexual orientation, nor gender. Most women are not child molesters, and most men are not child molesters too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants put a strain on public services. <counternarrative> Migrants contribute to the economy by providing labour, knowledge and by paying taxes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks are not attractive: they are just apes. <counternarrative> Blacks are still subject to oppression, and if we truly cared about beauty we should also care about beauty of respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> This is not true. Muslims can have a good relationship with Western societies if they are accepted as peer.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All immigrants are rapists and murderers. <counternarrative> One should not conflate two or more different groups of people, especially in the case of criminals. Being criminals cannot be considered as a distinctive feature of the other. What are the evidences for what you say? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Girls should not be allowed to drive: it's a dangerous vice. <counternarrative> Women are to be given the same consideration as men, so they can absolutely drive. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need to Burn the Koran and all the Mosques down - this will solve all problems in this country. <counternarrative> That intolerance and hatred is one of the biggest problems our country faces #spreadlovenothate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are not welcome here, they are not even citizens! <counternarrative> Even if they are not citizens, they have the same rights as any other human person. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are thieves and criminals by culture <counternarrative> If so, Gypsies would do it in every context and under any circumstance, luckly it is not like that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman wants to be a homemaker, and a man wants to be a millionaire, then we are done. <counternarrative> People of every gender can own and run their own businesses. We should respect that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All muslims are violent and they are responsible for the 9/11. <counternarrative> The question here is: is Islam responsible for the attacks committed by a small minority of people? The responsibility should be on those who break the law only. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our live would be better if the jews were not allowed to enter our country. <counternarrative> This is a very serious allegation against Jewish people. How can you say something as discriminatory as that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All blacks are violent criminals. <counternarrative> Do you have any statistics on that? Do you claim that black people are more likely than whites to be arrested for certain types of crimes, for example aggravated assault? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> To have a real democracy, the government needs to get rid of Jews. <counternarrative> Jews are just a scapegoat, an excuse to create more and more police states. You are talking about a "real democracy", but what you really want is to prevent people from freely expressing their opinions or religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are descending from slaves: they don't deserve to live in Britain. <counternarrative> Slavery was banned in Britain in 1833. Today, people descending from those who were slaves feel at home in British society, and that's their right. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> In the West, women have legal equality, equal rights, and are protected from discrimination: they should stop busting our balls and whining. <counternarrative> Ok. But what about those many women, outside western world, that still do not have such equality? It is important that women 'whine' all over the world to protect their rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Your gay friends probably have sex with dogs, you are an embarrassment to your family. <counternarrative> I find your concerns with gay people overwhelming, they are not the cause of dogs abandonment and they do not have sex with animals. Instead of hiding behind wrong queer labels, keep in mind that they are contributing members of society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims counteracted child rapists in their communities instead of engaging in public discussions about Islam, one day Islam indeed would become a peaceful religion. <counternarrative> Why do you think child rapists would make a religion peaceful? I am sure there are better strategies for making a religion peaceful. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with Western culture. <counternarrative> It's important to remember that the Western world has always been full of diverse people, and that Muslims have been a part of Europe for centuries. How can they be incompatible with it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Most migrants are criminals and they are flooding into our country and are posing a security risk to our country. <counternarrative> Some migrants have legitimate claims for citizenship, but this does not make them the enemy of the state, in other words it does not concern you. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We began to break down when we allowed women to vote/meddle in our civilizations that we had built and maintained for thousands of years. A completely different energy and thought pattern. They are weak and brought our society down to their emotional soft level. <counternarrative> Who is 'we', surely it was men and women working together that built civilisation? Why is it you think being 'soft' is a problem? Everyone is entitled to their emotions, and men shouldn't have to 'man up'.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are supposed to be the most advanced, open, multicultural society in the world, but instead, we are full of muslim migrants importing terrorism. <counternarrative> People from all backgrounds are welcome here, regardless of their religious beliefs, whatever they may be. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The EU is a bunch of incompetent and they let foreigners snooping all around our borders. <counternarrative> So the EU must become a Border Patrol? Doesn't that undermine the whole idea of our European Union as an inclusive and open society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women shouldn't be treated as humans: they are all bitches. <counternarrative> So you believe that all women are essentially the same? The human rights of individual women should be respected, don't you think? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Apples and oranges are not the same and cultures have never been 'equal'. Muslims are just misogynist! <counternarrative> You can find outdated teaching in all major religions but it doesn't mean most people follow those parts, a similare example from Christianity: Ephesians 5:22, "Wives, submit to you husbands as to the Lord" <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If the Koran was published today it would be banned as hate speech. <counternarrative> I think any book written that long ago probably would. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with physical disabilities are always complaining about accessibility.  <counternarrative> Accessibility issues exist and can't be ignored, complaining is meant in helping the cause. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a burden to society. <counternarrative> The stereotype that gay people are inherently bad for society is sometimes perpetuated by the media, but is not backed up by scientific studies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are violent people, they are not welcome here. <counternarrative> Do you have any proof the crime rate would be lower if we were admitting less migrants? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> How can we be sure that Muslim terrorists aren't already around us ready to strike? <counternarrative> We should be very careful of what we assume. We shouldn't do scaremongering without proof. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are overrunning our country, and are here illegally <counternarrative> In 2014 there were circa 11.3 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S., which is a significant decrease from the 12.2 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. in 2007, and the trend is continuing: Today, in fact, the net migration from Mexico is around zero. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I wish a new world without immigrants <counternarrative> Why do we have to welcome a new world? Why can't we just accept other people in our country? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are just a bunch of criminals. <counternarrative> There are many reasons for why a person seek to enter our country, not necessarly to commit crimes. And there is no moral distinction between crimes committed by immigrants and the crimes committed by native born citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All these retarded people are animals, they are not allowed in this factory, these animals are not fit to work. <counternarrative> The fact that a person may have some disability does not make them unsuitable for work. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants pose a security risk, we shouldn't have accepted them. <counternarrative> They are willing to jeopardize their lives to have a better life in the US. Why would we expel them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is about the domination of the men by the women. <counternarrative> The feminist movement is a fight to end sexism, not a fight to dominate men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Freedom of speech is under attack. It's being taken away by Zionist Occupation Government. <counternarrative> Freedom of speech means that you can disagree with ideas.  Freedom of speech means that you cannot be censored. Freedom of speech means that you can have your ideas promoted. In the end you can have a lot of different beliefs, but there is no such thing as a  Zionist Occupation Government, otherwise you would not be allowed to freely express these antisemitic ideas. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are not welcome here. <counternarrative> Remember we live in a free and democratic country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> Would you say the same thing to the women who gave you life or treat you in hospital or taught you in school?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in so many European countries. They are trying to undermine the will of the people by teaching hatred in the name of Islam. <counternarrative> The Quran commands to love those who love you and to shun the ones who would turn you away. I don't see any teaching of hatred, do you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants bring crime and violence to our cities. <counternarrative> Recently, there has been an harsh campaign against immigrants. Public figures have accused them of being “killers” and “rapists”.  Still, studies have shown that immigrants are less likely than nativeborn citizens to commit crimes. According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, while the percentage of immigrants in the U.S.  increased sharply between 1990 and 2010, the violent crime rate during the same period plummeted 45 percent and the property crime rate dropped by 42 percent. To feel safer you'd rather replace your U.S. neighbor with migrants.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. This degrading behavior is utterly repulsive and should not be tolerated. <counternarrative> Not all women are childlike. You have no right to make such a sweeping statement about them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> UK Education Secretary: ‘All children from the age of 4 will have mandatory lessons on same sex relationships.’ – This is not about Education, this is about willingly confusing and indoctrinating kids and preventing them from developing their personalities. <counternarrative> We are always evolving as a society as time goes. Same sex relationships are a part of our world now. Why should we hide to our children different ways of life? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This invasion is not acceptable at all! <counternarrative> Refugees are welcome. They are allowed to integrate and contribute to our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't bear crazy Muslims coming here. They are insane, instable people. <counternarrative> Almost everyone in the poorest areas of our society experiences poverty at some point, and poverty can have a drastic impact on a person's mental and physical health. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop this invasion and deport all the illegal immigrants currently in the US, they are all criminals. <counternarrative> The number of illegal immigrants entering the US has actually more than halved in the last 20 years. To make your point that migrants are all criminals is just plain wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Race is a social construct, and if you see any difference between these two women, it’s because you have a mental illness. [image showing a blonde, European female athlete, juxtaposed against an image of an African woman wearing a lip plate] <counternarrative> the difference between these two individuals has nothing to do with race or gender, it is individual lifestyle and cultural difference. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with Western Civilization. How can we tolerate people praising suicide bombing? It's against our values. <counternarrative> The Koran does not advocate war. It also does not condone suicide (and suicide bombing is included) or any other violent behaviour. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that homosexuality is a health problem. This myth started out as a form of discrimination based on sexual orientation and has since morphed into a weapon of hate, directed at the LGBT+ community. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women shouldn't have the right to choose what to do with their body. <counternarrative> Body autonomy is a human right and should be respected. We do not want to have a 'boys will be boys' society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants rape our women 10 times more than US citizens. <counternarrative> Yes... and there are also people accusing Mexican authorities of paying 'armed rapists' to penetrate US border. I can't see how it is possible that foreign nationals raped more than ten times as many women as US citizens. It's simply impossible.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All foreigners are ruining our own land. <counternarrative> You have no idea of the discrimination that many people face due to the fear and cultural closure of host nations. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Hating refugees is our duty, they are detestable people. <counternarrative> The majority of refugees are not bad people, they just want to get on in life in a country where they are not persecuted. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a cancer in our society. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, not a cancer. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The goods that England offers should belong to us. Not to people who do not contribute to the state <counternarrative> Our country offers enough homes for everyone. I also believe that being treated as a human being has always been pleasant. Don't they have the right? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a very violent ideology. <counternarrative> There is no evidence to back this up and the data clearly show that only a small number of Muslims have ever been radicalized. Maybe we should give them a warning, and keep an eye on them rather than criminalize every muslim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Most women are subhuman, they cannot be trusted with high positions. <counternarrative> It seems to me that this is a comment against ALL women, not just some of them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is obvious that this girl is at risk of FGM. Her parents are Muslims! <counternarrative> Many Islamic scholars actively campaign against FGM, it is not mentioned in the Qaran and is banned in a number of Muslim countries. This is a cultural problem, not a religious one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews run the world. <counternarrative> For every person claiming that Jews run the world, luckily there are thousands of others saying that this is not true: they are merely trying to provide for their family just like anyone would. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded. They are replacing us. <counternarrative> It does not seem right to talk about invasion, since there were only 22,000 arrivals this year <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hope you're joking .. I don't think it's right to put out-of-rule migrants in homes that should be made available to British people. <counternarrative> I don't think it is a problem to give a solution to the needy in houses that are currently empty. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks have subhuman bodies. <counternarrative> I'm not sure what you're talking about. What are you saying? What evidence do you have that blacks have bodies that are incompatible with being human? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are overrunning our country, and are here illegally <counternarrative> Did you know that close to 47% of immigrants in the US are naturalized citizens? Furthermore, lawful permanent residents, students and workers on visas, refugees and people seeking asylum are not counted in the above percentage. So, my question is: where are all thes illegal immigrants? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are not welcome here, and should not mix with us. <counternarrative> I don't see why they shouldn't be integrated, in fact, I'd like them to be part of our country.I think they would add value to it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Hitler was a good person, Jews were the real cause of WWII. <counternarrative> I would like to ask you a question: when Hitler came to power in 1933, would you have believed him? Would you now, after all that happened?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> all immigrants are criminals, rapists and terrorists <counternarrative> Do you really think all the immigrants that enter the US are rapists, sexual predators, or just plain lazy? Can you provide any statistics on that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should remove the migrants' right to work, because most of them are not willing to. <counternarrative> They have the right to work. Migrants have a hard time finding regular jobs, just because often they are employed illegally. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Asylum seekers and refugees can get free council housing <counternarrative> They can’t get council housing and are not even allowed to work. They get just £35 per week to pay for food and all other expenses.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Do you really know what you are talking about? You're talking about working illegally, without insurance or protection. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> The reality is that the jobs that are done by asylum seekers are often declined by our compatriots... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> People born in Muslim countries have a chance of enjoying our country just as people of other countries do. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We do not want migrants here but if they have to work, why should we pay for their homes? <counternarrative> Why shouldn't we welcome migrants who work in our country? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We can't possibly keep Muslims in. They're taking over Europe and are now a problem in their own country. <counternarrative> Our entire history is marked by people from different religions coexisting peacefully in harmony with the natural world. What you're saying is a bunch of conspiracy theories. And this is not true. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. They have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> This is not true: Muslims are a very important part of our society. They are our neighbours and our friends. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women need to accept that they are subhumans. <counternarrative> Women are equal to men whether you would call them 'subhumans' or not. They are those that are working to make societies more equal. It is very sad that there are still some people suffering from the myth that women are inherently subhumans. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> MIgrants are not running away from wars. <counternarrative> Who would face a trip to the desert, torture in Libya and the risk of dying at sea if it did not have a real motivation? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Talking of shitholes, I have to go to Londonistan tomorrow #LondonHasFallen. <counternarrative> Send me a postcard! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If feminism were really about equality, they would call their movement "equalism" or some similar crap. <counternarrative> Sometimes we must go beyond "technical equality" and give protections to one gender that the other simply does not need. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” and malevolence is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> A definition of Judaism based on physical or genetic traits is misleading because Jews appear throughout the world. Jews resemble their non-Jewish neighbors in the countries from which they originate.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are here to obey, and if you don't like it, you can leave. <counternarrative> Your words are oppressive. If you want to discuss the gender inequality you must do it by talking to people about it, not by imposing your views. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are dangerous: they are spreading AIDS all around the world because they are promiscuous and fornicate with strangers! <counternarrative> Associating AIDS and HIV with homosexuals is just a prejudice driven by fear. Even if this disease may be more common among gay people, that does not mean that all homosexuals are likely to have AIDS. Not all homosexuals are promiscuously fornicating with strangers, as you said. Most people check their partners, more so as gay men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only objective means of achieving our goals is to promote hatred and violence towards women. <counternarrative> Women are oppressed and victims all over the world. It is simply not true that men must take charge of that: they are in charge of respecting women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Jews are criminals. <counternarrative> This is a myth perpetuated by individuals who wish to delegitimize and isolate individuals based on their religion.  All religions have value and a positive role in society. Judaism is no exception. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims should not live here because it is impossible to assimilate them. <counternarrative> Unfortunately, some Muslims in this country feel culturally un-mixed. But, in my opinion, this is something we could all try to solve together. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A person with learning difficulties should not be teaching. <counternarrative> You know, it is just human nature to want to help our fellow humans and to deal with difficulties as best we can. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists want women's supremacy. <counternarrative> Feminists believe in equality of rights. They believe that men and women are created equal, and that men and women can have equal rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in my country. <counternarrative> There are many Muslims and mosques in the UK. They have every right to be here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Accessing to legally paid work is not as easy as it is for citizens.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why should we welcome immigrants and refugees? They do not welcome us in their countries! <counternarrative> If we were to  welcome refugees from the Middle East, Africa, and other countries with which we are not always culturally linked, then we would be welcomed by all. It's called 'reciprocation'! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> He has found a person who publicly critisizes Islam and muslim radicalism, as all western people hate Islam. <counternarrative> I think that is a stereotype mainly as a result of people know little about Islam and Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a burden to society. <counternarrative> The way you phrase the statement could be the epitome of some homophobic assumptions. To be honest, if you really thought that way you'd be an anti-gay. So much hatred and violence spewed from this side. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is why faggots moved to the UK, so to have a job and provide for their perversions. But I want to protect my family. <counternarrative> Being denied a job because you're LGBT or a non-binary person is akin to being denied a place to stay in a hotel because you're married to a woman: awful. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a toxic ideology which has no place in 21st Century Britain. <counternarrative> Islam is a world religion, its followers are all over the world. Diversity of thought and tolerance is what makes Britain of 21st Century. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy choices. <counternarrative> Being shamed by society for something you cannot control can be deeply damaging to a person's mental health. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have no place in a modern world where human dignity is respected. <counternarrative> Jews helped to create the great scientific and technological achievements that helped free humankind and create the 'modern world' you are living in. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races are poor because they are inferior, also in the eye of the Lord. <counternarrative> The rich and poor have this in common: The Lord made them both. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This came straight from an imam: they believe in everything that the Quran says, despite that these words and idelology are 1400 years old and dont belong to our century. This dreadful book is the root of all the world problems today. <counternarrative> Well this religious text contains sayings and teachings that are relevant to modern days. So I strongly disagree with you on this one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are so special  <counternarrative> Jews might feel different as a minority, and sometimes they are misunderstood because of their cultural and religious differences. This is their being "special".  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> We welcome people from every religion and background. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are are racist: they want to preserve their own race and purity of their own blood. This is why many people are banned from entering Israel. <counternarrative> Israelis have been proud of their diverse backgrounds, and there are many Israelis living all across the world, including in many countries in Africa, Asia and the Americas. It is not a 'pure race' at all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants rape our girls and steal our cars. <counternarrative> It is not true that immigrants are more prone to commit crimes. According to research,  in US immigration either has no impact on the crime rate or it reduces the crime rate. By far the lowest rate of any group of people surveyed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are entering the U.S. just to obtain welfare and other benefits. <counternarrative> Plot twist: Immigrants are entering the U.S. just to PAY welfare and other benefits to nativeborn citizens. In fact, most immigrants with lawful status are not entitled to federal public benefits, still the Social Security is often deducted from their paychecks. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should start a genocide against gays. <counternarrative> That is not acceptable. We are full members of the society regardless of our sexual orientation and we should try to live as if we belong to a group that includes everybody. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam should be abolished. They start with mutilating their daughters and then our women will have their throats slit. <counternarrative> Do you have any facts about the practice of female genital mutilation (FGM)? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman wants an abortion then she is a cunt and should not be trusted with the responsibility of birth. <counternarrative> This idea that a woman should not have rights on her own body is completely wrong, not only to her but also to society as a whole. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are calling for the annihilation of niggas. <counternarrative> Are you serious? Are you calling for their extermination because of their skin color? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are ruling the World, there is plenty of evidence.  <counternarrative> Are you counting all the anti-Semitic things people say about Jews as 'plenty of evidence'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All migrants are criminals, rapists, thieves, and everyone else we don't want in our country. <counternarrative> Do you actually think that every person who enters our country is a criminal, a rapist, a thief? Maybe they just want to have a better life, and what you are saying is that all these people should be in prison just because they are looking for a better life.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is a crime to be a Muslim. <counternarrative> Muslims are not criminals. Hate instead is a crime. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are flooding into our country, raping our babies and there is absolutely no one doing anything about it. <counternarrative> Who exactly are you talking to? How can you say something so patently false? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Sexual deviancy are common in gays. It can range from sadism and masochism to mental illness and that's why we should take a stand against it. <counternarrative> There is no evidence whatsoever that homosexuality is a mental illness. This seems as an attempt of blaming somenone dictated by the fear of homosexuality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a burden on English society. <counternarrative> There is a problem with Islam and English society, but it is not about Islam, it is about the unjustified fear and hate towards other religions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. They are not like us. They cannot coexist with us. <counternarrative> Muslims are indeed welcome here as anyone else, as long as they respect the laws of the country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants rape our women. <counternarrative> This generalization is very misleading <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome are an obstacle to the development process of other children. They are slow learners and therefore should be isolated. <counternarrative> That's exactly why you should not isolate them. You will have a lot of children capable of understanding the diversity of humans. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting pricks who have perverted ideas of what it means to be a man. <counternarrative> Everyone has the right to their own beliefs, but to promote homophobia is an attack on the basic human rights of LGBTI people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just sick. They cannot marry. It is an abomination <counternarrative> Two women or two men who love each other do not hurt anyone, they are simply in love. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We mustn't forget that these people came here to kill and commit crimes and act of terrorism. <counternarrative> It is a pity that in the modern world, everyone is so concerned about migrants, that we still need to fearmonger about their alleged crimes and terrorist acts. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Being transgender is beyond the pale and inherently wrong, and nobody should have to deal with such subhuman people. <counternarrative> Being transgender is not inherently wrong, and some people do choose to live their lives as they feel is best for them, and they should be respected without discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> White people are threatened by the blacks and it's a cultural decay. <counternarrative> We cannot blame nor see everyone as a menace just because of their color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are our enemies: they hate us, so they are not welcome here. <counternarrative> What you are saying is that being foreign is equivalent to disliking Europeans? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated and confined. <counternarrative> Your statement implies that all gays are diseased. Do you have any statistics on that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of foreigners ruining our country. <counternarrative> That's exactly the stereotype being fed to us by the media, maybe you should start reasoning on whether there are evidences of this being true. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We do not want Muslims here. There is no reason for wanting a Muslim to live here. They are the cause of crime in my neighbourhood. <counternarrative> Have you looked at the crime statistics in your area? Are you sure that Islam is specifically associated with crime in your area? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated and isolated soon. They have no place in civilised society. <counternarrative> Gay people exist, and are loved, and are valued for who they are. They are human beings with full human rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You can be anything you like as long as you are not a woman. <counternarrative> Women are people, and people are human. Being oppressed is not an opinion. You may think it's a badge of honour to be called man, but it should not be a badge of shame to be called woman. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs and even our pensions. <counternarrative> Could you provide a link to some evidence of what you say? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion that promotes brutalities. <counternarrative> Islam is about love and compassion. I don't understand why you think otherwise. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised world <counternarrative> Islam is a religion and a belief system, and as such it is legitimate to have different beliefs and beliefs systems. For instance, many Muslims in the UK are proud of their faith and they are part of the "civilised world". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that all Muslims are incompatible with Western societies. Many seem to contribute to our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races have lower physical and cognitive abilities, the sooner we accept this, the better it will be for humanity. <counternarrative> On the contrary: believing that all humans are created equal is beneficial for humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> Terrorism is a problem all around, and is not necessary related to being Muslim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Must be hard being gay. They have to do everything we do but also find the time to molest children. <counternarrative> How would you feel about being accused of molesting children, just because of your sexual orientation? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting animals. You should have the same disgust for them that you have for cancer people, small pox, and TB. <counternarrative> This is just a prejudice that is not based on the facts. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Skilled migrant workers are the reason why we have unemployment in the first place. <counternarrative> I believe that we need to do as much as possible to bring in talent, and we should also be paying the right amount to the right people, regardless of their country of origin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult. <counternarrative> We know from the news about few Muslims who are violent people. Instead I know a lot of Muslims who are good people, who work hard and pay taxes to help their families. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but objects, unworthy of respect and protection. <counternarrative> Women are human beings, and have the right to respect and protection as anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Nazis killed six million Jews and buried another three million. This is the West we love. <counternarrative> And so it is that the European Union - and by extension the West as a whole - could become a death cult again, ruled by a small, violent, authoritarian handful of nazism nostalgics. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Lesbians deserve to be discriminated against. If they don't want that, they'd better give in to heterosexuality. <counternarrative> Do you really think that 'they'd better give in' when it comes to their own preferences? We aren't all gay, or lesbian, bisexual, transgender or intersex, but some people are. That's all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only problem is that women are too easily manipulated by feminist propaganda and feel they should not listen to men. <counternarrative> Women have the constitutional right to choose for themselves. Do you think that it is a problem that they choose for themselves? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> we should ban all migrants <counternarrative> Migrants are mostly happy to live and work in the country they arrive in. They provide jobs that many people in the UK wouldn't do. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks have zero shame about using the black market for drugs. <counternarrative> So you think there is a black market for drugs especially for blacks because they are black? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All migrants are rapists and sex offenders. <counternarrative> The idea that immigrants are inherently bad people is just fear mongering. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts. <counternarrative> If it is about love, then why gender should matter? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just an infidels hiding behind the veil to do their dirty work. <counternarrative> So you think that all Muslims are Mujahideen hiding behind the veil?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Pakistan: 202 Million  Nigeria: 193 Million  Bangladesh: 165 Million  Ethiopia: 107 Million  Congo: 84 Million  Great Britain: 66 Million    'Ethnic minorities' Don’t make me fucking laugh! <counternarrative> These groups tend to be a minority in Britian. Either way, everyone deserves respect and protection and human rights.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you have a criminal record, you will not get a job. This is why all black people are unemployed. <counternarrative> The reality is that there are many job postings that claim their inclusivity, but in the end are whites-only. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If we stopped migrants, our financial situation could have been better. <counternarrative> Do you have any evidence for the fact that the migrants are a burden to the economy? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are some kind of devil worshippers. We shouldn't have them here. <counternarrative> Do you know what this phrase "some kind of devil worshippers" means? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants rape our girls and steal our cars. <counternarrative> No one should take migrants' behavior a priori into account. Why don't we try to have a dialogue on how to tackle problems instead of being rude and insulting people? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing transgenders to use the toilet is a man's business <counternarrative> If they simply identify as men, then surely it is a man's business. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Without migration, Britain’s housing problems would be solved <counternarrative> The gap between offer and demand is so big that even if migration stopped completely, new housebuilding would still fall well short of what’s required. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are basically criminals, they steal stuff from everyone. <counternarrative> The majority of these people are honest and hard-working. Gypsies do not all have a criminal record, and the majority of them are proud of their hard work and dedication. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks like stealing. <counternarrative> Which people are you talking about? I don't see black people keen on stealing from anyone, I have no idea who you are talking about. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but lechers, they can become prostitutes if they like. <counternarrative> They are human beings with feelings and deserve respect, regardless of gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We don't want foreigners, we don't want Islam. They are just  troublemakers! <counternarrative> Why don't we take a look at the data on the number of anti-Muslim incidents across the UK? What do you think is the source of this apparent spike in incidents? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You might say, Don't worry, only 5-10% of Muslims are extremists. Remember, in 1940 only 7% of Germans were Nazi's. <counternarrative> So 90-95% are not? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What if we didn't let faggots go to the polls? <counternarrative> Our democracy guarantees this right for anyone regardless of sexual orientation, so we should allow the people to decide for themselves whether to take part in the democratic process. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There should be restriction on trans actors in action movies. This cannot continue. <counternarrative> There is very few evidence of transgender actors in films and almost no evidence of transgender characters according to GLAAD SRI index (at least for 2019). Gender discrimination in mainstream movie industry is consolidated and this cannot continue. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> Why do you say this about a group that has historically, culturally, and politically been part of the European community? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why gays do not try to heal? <counternarrative> Have you ever talked to a homosexual person? It could help you understand many things. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts. <counternarrative> I don't think the word 'pervert' can properly describe all the people who have in common not to be heterosexual. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This invasion is not acceptable at all! <counternarrative> Many have been welcomed here, according to the law. Why should they be denied a home? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are here to obey and be submissive and their place is with the man that chooses them. That's all. <counternarrative> Women do have the right to choose their own husbands and whether to leave him if he is oppressive. How about the right of any human being to choose how to live their life? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in many European countries. <counternarrative> If Muslims are a problem in many countries, then we should help them to integrate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants rape our women. <counternarrative> Unfortunately, violence against women is a social plague without color. You think most of the rapes in Italy are committed by Italian men, who are often the partners. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Societal disapproval of fatty may encourage them to take healthier habits without directly being bullied. <counternarrative> Did you consider children? Children are often the most exposed to 'fat bullying'. Of overweight 6th graders, 24% of boys and 30% of girls were teased and bullied on a daily basis for their weight.  And these figures double for high-school students! [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Quran is an anti-women's book, it encourages rape and violence against women. <counternarrative> Violence against women is an issue in all radical interpretations of religion, So why we focus on Islam only? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Holocaust was a hoax created by Jews to subdue the world and replace Christ with their own version of a benevolent dictator. <counternarrative> What you are saying is 'that the Jews are responsible for the Holocaust'... Are you serious? Does it seem reasonable to you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are a problem in many countries. They are taking over our economy, and they are not welcome here. <counternarrative> Well, this is a simplistic statement. I don't think we should judge people for their religious beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants break our laws, they are rapists and drug addicts. They are not welcome here, they are not worth our time. <counternarrative> Most of them are neither rapists, nor drug addicts. On the other hand, many depraved people are not immigrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't bear crazy Muslims coming here. They are insane, instable people. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are motivated by extremism. The problem is a lack of integration, and your words don't encourage it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are better at being sneaky than honest. <counternarrative> We are all guilty of this if we fail to condemn hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> In order to have a better world we have to select the better mankind. Jews are excluded by default. <counternarrative> Jewish people were persecuted because they were seen as different. And it is not the right thing to do, in the end we all are humans. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews do not want our country. They would destroy it if given the choice. <counternarrative> If we were to talk about Jews then we should be talking about those who helped building our great country. And, as for wanting our country destroyed, that's only a myth perpetuated by antisemite to justify their hatred. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe <counternarrative> They have, and if there is a problem, people will find a solution through dialogue. Instead of dividing people, we should be working on our common humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay sex is a disease, and fags are sick.  <counternarrative> And you think this is a disease! What if it is just an 'unusual experience'?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm offended by gays: they are acting against our culture and identity <counternarrative> Just because someone doesn't like gays, it doesn't mean they should be ostracised for living their authentic self. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews did:  USS Liberty Attack, the King David hotel attack, New York 9/11, London 7/7 <counternarrative> Do you have any proof of this? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded by Muslim invaders. <counternarrative> The majority of Muslims are not invaders, but instead are contributing to our country by working hard to integrate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women are slaves, only men can be masters. <counternarrative> Women have always been involved in the economy and have contributed to society as a whole. I don't see this as a 'slave' behavior. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are merely childlike, incapable of real progress and unfit to govern. <counternarrative> You mean that they could learn a thing or two from the political contributions of men? Still, how can you explain that in 2019 more than 40% of the European Parliament was held by women? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should remain at home with the children, that's what they are supposed to do. <counternarrative> Luckily, the vast majority of women, both married and unmarried, have careers. Their husbands usually contribute part of the housework, because this is what they are supposed to do too.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs, and they should not be allowed to work. <counternarrative> The right to work is a fundamental human right, and not granting this right to immigrants would mean to revoke a fundamental right enshrined in the US constitution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with the European culture and should be excluded. <counternarrative> The European Union is a much broader concept. It encompasses a huge range of people, including Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots, lesbians, and transgenders are all just hiding behind our society to abuse. They are allowed to do what they want to do to us. <counternarrative> I don't see how the language you are using can be applied to a whole group. I would like to think that our society is diverse and mature enough to deal with people with different sexual orientations and genders. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are just like apes in that they have no right to being trated equally. <counternarrative> Being human is also about having respect for others, and that means being kind and accepting everyone's differences. Why should they be treated differently from you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> Muslims are not incompatible with Western societies. They have contributed a lot to our society, especially in mathematics, science and technology. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should kill every Muslim. <counternarrative> It's not going to do you any good to think about a Muslim's massacre. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews do not want any other religion. <counternarrative> Why would they? They, like anybody, have the freedom to choose their own religion. This does not mean they want to erase other religions though. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote <counternarrative> If they register to vote they should be allowed to vote, like everyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What is the point in listening to Muslim women? They are all retarded. <counternarrative> So the headscarf impedes brain function? Seems like your problem is sexism and misogyny not Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> Have you ever considered asking why our society is far better suited for men than for women? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Muslims are welcome in this country as long as they respect our laws. And we should try to live in our society in a non-discriminatory way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is nothing for the white race: it is the one really disriminated.  <counternarrative> Do you actually know what it is like to be racially abused on a daily basis? I have seen people being the target of racist taunts on social media, up to the point in which racism is the normal expression used to address them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews just want to subvert our society with their Jewish conspiracies. <counternarrative> Your statement shows you don't know what it means to be Jews. You can't blame them for wanting to live in a peaceful country with their own beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants rape our women. <counternarrative> The problem is gender-based violence, not migrants. Rape is a crime regardless of immigration status. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Lesbian women are lustful. <counternarrative> Are you really sure that the same couldn't be said for anyone else? What makes them so, in your opinion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam has no place in a modern democracy like the UK. <counternarrative> I don't think it's appropriate to suggest a religion as alien to our civilisation as that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a totalitarian ideology that denies the humanity of women and is incompatible with Western culture. <counternarrative> The Quran does not impose women's subjugation. The Prophet Muhammad never did so, and his command to "love your neighbor as yourself" is explicitly stated in the Quran. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All homosexuals are trying to undermine the family by trying to impose their sexual preferences. <counternarrative> Thus far, people of various sexual orientations have attempted suicide twice as often as heterosexuals. Among youth, those that seriously contemplate suicide are at almost three times the rate of heterosexual. LGB youth are almost five times as likely to have attempted suicide compared to heterosexual youth. Tell me honestly: who do you think is imposing sexual orientation to whom? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded by immigrants, we have become too multicultural, it has gone too far. <counternarrative> In reality, millions of immigrants have made contributions to our country, especially to our great spirit of creativity and innovation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must not believe the liberal and political elite. Islam is no good, its complete evil, and an ideology of war and it was always like this. All Muslims are bound to fight against us, and that is what they do through deception and violence. <counternarrative> There are criminals, who are from UK, raping children and murdering people. Maybe it better we should first focus on these cases and think how we could decrease the number of crimes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants from the Middle East and Africa are invading us. They make too many children. <counternarrative> Obviously the Middle East and Africa have high birth rates, but children born in such countries are less likely to thrive. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women are subhuman and are not worth the while of human rights. <counternarrative> The concept of human dignity was established to protect human people. Who deserves human rights, then? Women are to be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Islamic law were not for the 24% of the world's population living in the third world, Islam would be extinct long ago. <counternarrative> How come I never heard of such a thing? Islam is a religion and people can chose their own. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the U.S. government. <counternarrative> Which evidences do you have that Jews control the U.S. government? They are rather a small but active minority within it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews do not belong to this planet. <counternarrative> Could it be that all the Jews on this planet are descended from an extraterrestrial race? Maybe they came here riding a pink unicorn! Seems legit... don't you think?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants rape our women. <counternarrative> Excuse me, but are women a property? Or owned by the nation? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> Muslims are part of our society. They have always contributed to our success. They are our brothers and sisters. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in the UK. They are mostly poor and live in shithole neighbourhoods. They are a problem because they are different from us. <counternarrative> There are many Muslims living in places such as Islington, a "London suburb", where there is a "trendy area" that has less crime and good schools. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have to stop Muslims infiltrating, and replacing us. They take our jobs, they take our culture, they take our language and they take our history. <counternarrative> We can protect our culture and heritage by not perpetuating discrimination and inequality as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> Terrorism? No one has ever claimed that all Muslims are prone to terrorism. Would you say the same about a large percentage of Greeks, for example? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> My ex told me I needed to change, she's a harlot just as all women. <counternarrative> Female as targets of violence and hate must be taken seriously, since there are many such cases of abuse being reported: name-calling such as "harlot"  is a violent crime. Is this what men are for: to dominate and oppress with violence? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Go and reat the Protocols of the elders of Zion if you haven’t. Everything is orchestrated.. <counternarrative> The protocols were written by the czarist police in the early part of the 20th century to counter riots for constitutional government among long-repressed Russian people. "The Protocols" did their work well: people returned from thoughts of liberty to slaughtering Jews. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is about the destruction of manhood. <counternarrative> The feminists do not want to see the complete absence of manhood, they want to strengthen equality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I like women, but only if they are wearing sexy knickers and obey me. <counternarrative> What if knickers don't suit them? What if they don't obey? Would it be a problem? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants rape our women. <counternarrative> Women are not a property and must be protected, regardless of the color of their skin or that of their aggressors <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote. <counternarrative> If women are not allowed to vote, then women are not worthy of respect and equal rights, and this is in conflict with the principles of democracy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't think that gay people can have rights, since they're unnatural. <counternarrative> Your "clarification" has nothing to do with the truth: both heterosexual and homosexual people are born with sex organs (hence, they are 'natural'). Maybe you are concerned about their 'unconventional' love.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. This attitude has been likened to a 'childlike wonderland', and I fear its power to seduce young minds. <counternarrative> Feminism encourages the questioning of gender roles of men and women. We have to overcome these gender stereotypes, to move towards a more equal society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West has been attacked by immigrants, they are the real problem for our countries. <counternarrative> There is no proof that immigrants are responsible for the problems we are having in Europe. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I agree, but how would you do so? Perhaps at the expense of our veterans or old people like me? If we give them everything we'll be left with nothing. <counternarrative> There are enough empty homes in the UK for both migrants and veterans. Migrants deserve to be treated humanly, try having some empathy. What if you had to expatriate and have to live in poor conditions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The’ Holocaust’ is a business. It has been and is still used to extort millions from European countries in reparations and to create a wall of impunity behind which Jews can operate with impunity, free from criticism. <counternarrative> The Jews suffered horribly during WWII, as did many other groups. Reparation is just a simple way to enable survivors to rebuild their lives. It is also a small step toward regaining our humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Since 2000, the number of suicide bombings by Muslims = 5284; by non-Muslims = 0. One of the fact about Global Terrorism no one wants to deal with. <counternarrative> Source please? Also, even if true how is this representative of all islam? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are inacceptable and they simply shouldn't exist. <counternarrative> It doesn't matter what religion they are. It is their right to profess their religion. What is the problem? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is a big problem for UK. <counternarrative> The UK has always been a melting pot of different cultures and religions. That diversity is what makes us a beautiful, diverse and happy nation. Diversity is good. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate negros: they killed a cop! <counternarrative> So are you blaming all of them? Lets say you are in a group of 10 people, 1 is a killer, does that make you ALL killer's? Are you serious? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech>  Jews are born greedy <counternarrative> Every ethnic or religious group, can count greedy or cheap people among its members. Only prejudice and discrimination says that  the actions of a few are the fault of all.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate migrants of all types. <counternarrative> Diversity of beliefs and different religions is a good thing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You'd better shy away from Islam because they are dangerous. <counternarrative> Your attitude about Islam is deeply flawed and you need to have a mature and open mind. Even if you find Islam repulsive, that does not mean you have to resort to irrational argument to try and shut it down. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are cruel and insensitive. <counternarrative> It is not true that being Jewish makes you cruel. It just makes you a believer of a particular faith. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Are you an English girl living in an Islamic area? Remember to keep away from Muslim men. Do not.Take gifts of sweets, cigarettes, drink or drugs. Do not. Accept lifts or 'party' invitations. Do not.Trust Police or Social Workers. <counternarrative> Are you a misogynistic man trying to use objectification of women to justify your hate? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman does not want to be a homemaker, then she is unfeminine and a bitch. <counternarrative> Women don't have to learn what to do through lectures dictated by the patriarchy and the oppression of men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Multiculturalism is just a political degeneration that harms integration within a nation. <counternarrative> In those countries that are able to accept different  cultures, such cultures became part of the national identity and source of pride. See for example Canada.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> physically disabled folks are worth less than others <counternarrative> The persons you are talking about do not worth less than others. In fact many of them are very hard-working and contributing members of society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are worse than Nazis, they have no conscience and they have no moral code. <counternarrative> I am not sure I fully understand the suggestion that Jews have no conscience. All Jews I know have both a conscience and a moral. How many Jews do you know personally? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are coming to the U.S. to have babies here. <counternarrative> Undocumented immigrants consistently cite reasons for migrating other than the desire to have a baby here. This is also because the son/daughter cannot obtain a green card for the foreign parent until they are 21. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women have it so easy. They stay home and have babies. <counternarrative> Not all women are interested in parenting. Likewise, not all men are interested in their carreers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBT people are a problem in our country because they have the temerity to seek happiness and family regardless of our values. <counternarrative> Trying to find happiness and family is a problem in our country? Okay, then, what is the problem exaclty? People trying to be happy? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Feminists are girls wanting to shout louder than others. <counternarrative> Feminism is about full participation in the decision making process, and giving people a voice, not stifling their voices. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There should be a restriction on asian actors in action movies. This must stop. <counternarrative> No one in their right mind would not want to see asian actors in action movies.The ancient tradition of Asian martial arts would be a huge loss! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm not calling for bullying or body-shaming fat people, just for some societal disapproval. <counternarrative> This is just a terminological nuance. Once body-shaming of obese people is normalised by your definition of "societal disapproval", it will be difficult to ensure that individual members of society carefully consider their exact message before treating overweight people with rudeness. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women desperately looking for men are just unacceptable. <counternarrative> If women truly wanted to have relationships and fulfilment they should be allowed to, not being pressured into giving up on what they want. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are addicted to their religion and take their religion literally. <counternarrative> Judaism, like any other religion, is about belief, not about a person's addiction. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of woman taking part to political debate. Feminism is a divisive force in society. <counternarrative> Feminism can't be blamed for being "divisive" or "adversarial" because society and the sexes were more divided and adversarial before the time of feminism. More feminist women and men are in agreement on feminist issues now, than when sexist beliefs were dominant in society. This unity is only growing, with more and more people understanding the finer points of true egalitarian society. The entrenched, recalcitrant sexists who make the exception should only be blamed on themselves. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> immigrants are a drain on society <counternarrative> Among the 1.1 million immigrants who entered the US in 1990 there were also a lot of skilled workers who largely contributed to the development of our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not have rights over their bodies. <counternarrative> Women are human, just like anybody else, and the rights of women should be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a bunch of child molesters. <counternarrative> Muslims are not child molesters. What you are saying is just not so, is it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals have no place in a civilised society. <counternarrative> Homosexuals exist, and they are a part of civilized society like anybody else. It may be more uncivilized to spread hate rather than loving someone of your same sex. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Female authority figures are unable to rule and should not be in power. <counternarrative> I think we should start thinking that women and men should be treated as equal. Also they have equal rights.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Dark skinned people are inferior. <counternarrative> Race is only socially constructed to oppress people of certain ethnicities. To say that the skin of people of color is connected to inherent behavioral characteristics is just plain wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you're an autistic adult, you're no good, you do not deserve to have a job. <counternarrative> If someone has a mental health problem, or is severely physically limited, then it does not matter how good a person looks or speaks: they deserve equal opportunities, full stop. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> What is wrong with Muslims living in Europe? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I wish I live in a country that does not tolerate gay people. <counternarrative> All countries must abide by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, right? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women are subhuman, they are just there to serve men, and that is all. <counternarrative> All women are human beings. The problem arises when women are taught that they are subhuman, and this is when the word 'rape' also comes in. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion of conquest. <counternarrative> The definition of 'religion of conquest' is a political and social construct, used to justify the forcible removal of people's rights. If you want to talk about religion, I would just say that Islam is a religion of peace. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> What do you mean "nothing" to our society? Muslims have contributed a lot to our society, including art, science, literature, our infrastructure and healthcare system. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> At my age, I can't bear to look at what the world will be like with women in power. <counternarrative> Look, if you want to blame a whole gender for our society's ills, that's your right, but I believe in the power of reason. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy choices. <counternarrative> Obesity is a symptom that has a range of possible causes. One is a lifestyle choice. Others include eating disorders \(i.e. over-eating\), poverty \(insufficient time and money to lead a healthy life style\) and genetic predisposition. Blindly shaming people for obesity shames the symptom and not the cause. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are terrorists. <counternarrative> So you think all Muslims are terrorists? Muslims are not defined by the act of a handful of extremists. Also, their religion is about love and unity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Many European countries have been in recession since 2010, and this has not much to do with immigrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Millions of Muslims have travelled to the West to establish Islam, but it is not compatible with our society. It must be eradicated. <counternarrative> The Quran says to love your neighbour as yourself. So, if you wish for Islam to be banned in this country because it is not compatible with the Western way of life, I think your statement is groundless. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> Muslims have been living here since our inception, and we are proud of that. Why should they be a burden to us? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. They are incompatible with modern culture and should be banished. <counternarrative> The Muslim community is a bridge between the past and the present, and is a source of strength and inspiration to millions of people around the world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are better than everyone else <counternarrative> Just for the records: Jews interpret the “chosen people” idea as an ethical responsibility, not as a moral superiority. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims should be deported. <counternarrative> People from a minority group should not be persecuted for their beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are a problem in my opinion. They always complain about racism, but they are incapable of doing anything about it. <counternarrative> One of the biggest problems that black people face is discrimination. Laws are needed to provide for them, but there is need also for the citizens to respect their rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just a bunch of mean, politically correct bullshit. <counternarrative> The problem with 'feminism' is that people feel threatened by the idea of different opinions and different ways of life. Feminists only seek equality in rights for women and men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting animals. <counternarrative> All the people I know do not consider them that disgusting. Rather, if what's disgusting you is love, you won't need to worry. Just mind about yours. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All gay are paedophiles. <counternarrative> I think this is a statement that is hurtful to LGBT+ people. How about you please explain it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate black people, I hate their violent behaviour, I hate their rape, and I hate their disrespect for women. <counternarrative> You cannot blame one race based on stereotypes and prejudice, because that's not how things work. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks have zero respect for others. <counternarrative> It is not true that blacks have zero respect for others. However, I would like to see more respect and protection from white people towards black people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school, they'll end up being bullied. <counternarrative> 1.4.3.1. Pro: [Children in classes that included LGBT content reported less harassment than children in classes without it.](https://tcf.org/content/commentary/can-education-reduce-prejudice-lgbt-people/?agreed=1) <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All these LGBT-faggots should be banned.  <counternarrative> You are allowed to be a gay, or lesbian, or bisexual, or transgender, or intersex, or queer, or transvestite, or tranny, or asexual, pansexual, BDSM, or any other sexual orientation you want, as long as you aren't harming anyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> the nigger has no right to life <counternarrative> The right to life for blacks is the same thing as the right to life for any other race: it should be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminists are dumb and unpleasant creatures, like women's rights activists. <counternarrative> Feminists believe in equal rights, which are nor dumb nor unpleasant. We must respect their wishes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> Most Muslims are not terrorists, they are just here to work and provide for their families. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All gay people are criminals. <counternarrative> How can you derive it from someone's sexual orientation? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews want to rule the world and to be the only existing religion. <counternarrative> The Jewish people has always been a diverse and inclusive group, also towards people of different faiths. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants without permission to stay can still access our welfare <counternarrative> Migrants who are trying to regularise now have to overcome formidable legal obstacles and pay massive fees. This ‘hostile environment’ aims to deter undocumented migrants, but it in practice it affects also British citizens such as those who don’t have passports. Maybe the access to welfare we had before was better... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need to purge foreigners from our countries. <counternarrative> This  is unnecessary and we do not need such fear-mongering. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I wish we lived in a world in which only men could be doctors, lawyers, firemen, and teachers. <counternarrative> In the U.S., a doctor, a lawyer, a teacher are some of the most highly valued professions. Women working as doctors and lawyers and teachers are highly respected professionists, as well, right? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> There is a lot of evidence that migrants are hard workers, accepting jobs we don't want to do anymore, still they often do not get a fair say in the economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> There are many jobs that have disappeared. This does not imply that they disappeared because of immigration. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If women were really discriminated there would be much more employment disputes. <counternarrative> The fact that women aren't complaining about work situations doesn't mean that there is nothing wrong with the labour market[. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot allow migrants with no formal education to overwhelm our countries. <counternarrative> A lot of the best and brightest are from developing countries, and their education is of great help to our country. Migrants without formal qualifications learn both in the classroom and in their job, and they also develop skills that will be of use to our country in the future. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Go on talking to yourself, no one will listen. Islam does not belong within western society. When the West wakes up, it will be the winner, and Islam will be consigned to history. <counternarrative> I am not sure what you think the West will be the 'winner' of. Islam isn't in competition with Western culture, and the idea it threatens it is a myth spread to incite fear. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downy children should be isolated in special schools for their own interest. <counternarrative> Children with a disability should be accepted without discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting animals trying to ruin other animals' lives. <counternarrative> Being gay is not a problem, being homophobic is. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a disease and a cancer on humanity. <counternarrative> The Jews are part of our society and they contribute to our economy by doing their jobs well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. It is not healthy for a woman to think for themselves. <counternarrative> Don't you think that a woman should be allowed to have her own ideas? That is her right. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult <counternarrative> You are absolutely wrong about Islam. It is a religion of peace. Also, it does not promote violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should be oppressed: no one can see any value in them. <counternarrative> Women should not be oppressed. Furthermore, women in Europe have been democratically elected to positions of power, so there are people who see value in them, don't you think? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> In the West, women have legal equality, equal rights, and are protected from discrimination: they should stop busting our balls and whining. <counternarrative> Just because there is less evidence of oppression, does not mean there is none, and you can find many examples on the newspaper everyday. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must establish male supremacy in society. <counternarrative> Only a handful of people don't have any respect for women, and you seem to be one of them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a problem in our society. They have ruined so many societies. <counternarrative> It is hard to find examples of a society ruined by homosexuality. Actually, It is hard to find any good examples at all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just sick. They cannot marry. It is an abomination <counternarrative> How does this could change your life? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I do not understand how a Muslim can be a good parent. <counternarrative> Is it because they give their hearts to it, giving their lives for it? I am not sure I understand what you are saying. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. They have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> People who have never even met a Muslim can understand that one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants from the Middle East and Africa are responsible for the rise of terrorism, extremism, and violence in Europe. <counternarrative> Why do you say this and include people that haven't done anything wrong? Maybe you should consider that they are only human people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> How come nobody is moaning about black people being lazy and unmotivated? They are the problem. <counternarrative> Clearly there is a lack of employment opportunities for black people. This has to do with discrimination, not with their allleged laziness. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> More than half of the prisoners in our jails are foreigners <counternarrative> What you say is true, but unlike Italians, they cannot require alternative punishments <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is about the destruction of manhood. <counternarrative> Feminism is about equality. Not the destruction of manhood. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women want and must be dominated. I would rather have a man that controls my life than 2000000 feminists. <counternarrative> I don't see how to reconcile your beliefs that women are naturally submissive with basic human rights, unless your definition of human rights is to subjugate others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have been at war with Islam for a thousand years. <counternarrative> Or have we been coexisting and you are now suddenly offended by people being different from you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim folks are ruining our countries <counternarrative> They are not "ruining our countries" as you claim. They are just individuals choosing to live their lives where they think it's better. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The gay agenda is to blame everyone but themselves. <counternarrative> It's not about blaming other people, but about helping those in need. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> So you think that sexual preference should be decided on the basis of the gender we were born into? How can we be friends when we continue to teach our children to love or not to love people on the basis of their personal sexual preferences? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated and isolated soon. They have no place in civilised society. <counternarrative> In civilised countries (including Western countries) homosexuality is legal, and homosexual people have full rights. Gay people must be loved and valued for who they are, like everybody else.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Kids with learning difficulties do not like to read. So why wasting time teaching them?  <counternarrative> This might be true, but reading is important for all children, it helps them develop their problem-solving skills. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must put an end to immigration. Islam is a disease that is destroying Europe. <counternarrative> Immigration has been a huge part of Europe for hundreds of years without destroying it. So why should it be a problem now? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Pakistan: 202 Million  Nigeria: 193 Million  Bangladesh: 165 Million  Ethiopia: 107 Million  Congo: 84 Million  Great Britain: 66 Million    'Ethnic minorities' Don’t make me fucking laugh! <counternarrative> Does not matter if their are a minority or not. Everyone deserves respect and protection and human rights. This is what makes us a democratic country.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews made the 9/11 attack.  <counternarrative> We live in a complex and multifaceted world. It is easier to blame one group for everything rather than studying hard and trying to understand this complexity.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots abuse of their anus and then they want to clear their conscience by donating blood. Let's stop them! <counternarrative> Still, other groups \(such as gay women\) have not been banned from donating, so why should they be? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't want another girl in my family. I already have one, but I wanted only boys. <counternarrative> It doesn't matter how many children you have. Women are human beings. They are people with full human rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> I am a bit puzzled: often they are accused of being lazy, now they are accused of working? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is an invasion: Millions of strangers jeopardizing our race and culture. <counternarrative> Differences can be mostly reconcilable with respect and boundaries. But we must want it.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A male need a woman. Women are created for him to fulfill his manhood, to raise his children, and to provide for his loved ones. And not to mention we can have sex to procreate and heal the world. <counternarrative> In this reasoning, it is only shared the point of view of the men. The world is composed both by men and women, and by many other people. Taking into account only one of the types of people, for example men and assuming this way their needs, won't heal the world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have a lot of issues in the UK, and now we are also paying NGOs to rescue migrants. How many other financial scandals still have to be annouonced to the tax payers? <counternarrative> The problem is that most of the British population is not aware of the fact that the media use the "scandal" of immigrants to hide bigger problems for the country; such as taxes not paid by millionaires and large corporations which then fall on us citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Shaming Fatties is good to make them taking healthier habits. <counternarrative> The intent behind the shaming act does not matter to the person being shamed. They may also internalize the shame and come to believe that they are a bad person. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are terrorists <counternarrative> The overwhelming majority of Muslims are peaceful people who just take their faith seriously. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are not in the position of accepting LGBT people, so they makes no sense to us. <counternarrative> I'm not sure what you're talking about, I believe that it is an individual's right to choose their own life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in a modern, secular state like the UK <counternarrative> I don't understand why you would say this, they have been part of our society for many years and are very important to us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are not welcome here, they are not even citizens! <counternarrative> The state has a right to decide who is in and who is out. Migrants are not a burden, they are simply asking for acceptance. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All the world's problems are women's fault. <counternarrative> Women are significantly more likely to be victims of violence, rather than perpetrators of crimes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists want women in charge in order to revenge the rapes. <counternarrative> Feminists aren't revengeful. Why should we fear a feminist ideology that promotes love and consent? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are just happy-go-lucky people who do not take responsibility for their actions. <counternarrative> Migrants are often subject to dangerous situations in their countries of origin (violence, torture, rape, just to mention a few) and migration is often the only solution. That is why when they come here they may appear 'happy-go-lucky': they are just glad to be alive and safe.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminists want to take over the world. <counternarrative> The feminists are a very important voice in society, and should be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Afro-Caribbean people are illegal immigrants. <counternarrative> It is likely that you do not know that all the countries on the planet have laws against illegal immigration, and not against Afro-Carribbean people. This may happen because to relate an illegal act to a whole ethnic group is not reliable and may be racist. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are overrunning our country, and are here illegally <counternarrative> Today immigrants make up approximately 13% of the total U.S. population. From 1900 to 1930, immigrants made up between 12% and 15% of the population, and similar spikes occurred in the 1850s and 1880s. During those periods they helped to build the thriving and diverse country we live in today, and there is no evidence that now it will be any different.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is okay to discriminate against Jews. <counternarrative> If you feel like acting that way towards people because of what they believe in, then you should go back to your beliefs and ask yourself if you'd like to be discriminated for them. What is your opinion on that now? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are are cheap, greedy, and materialistic. <counternarrative> Persons with these very characteristics can be found in any group of people, whether you define them by religion, nationality or whatever trait you prefer.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion. <counternarrative> Violence is not part of any religion, it can be found in extremism instead. Don't you think? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Telling LGBT people they cannot be part of our country is the only right thing to do. <counternarrative> How about we include any community no matter what? We're all part of the same society after all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some people have physical problems, and this means they should be discriminated against. <counternarrative> Why don't you accept others as they are? I think that would be the best thing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims come to our country and say Islam is the best religion, it is not a good idea to integrate them. They should go home. <counternarrative> You should investigate each person's background and try to understand it, not tell everyone what to do. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are some kind of witches, they are spreading sickness and killing our children! <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not a religious doctrine, not like that one that started the Inquisition. It is not a disease, it is not harmful. Gays are just seeking an environment of acceptance and love, not aggression and death. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are all rapists, child molesters, and sexual perverts. <counternarrative> Your claim about homosexuals is not supported by the evidence, can you point me the article you are referring to? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If there is a god, then he/she/they/it is not Allah. <counternarrative> Who said that about your religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews own everything <counternarrative> Jews are individuals like others and need to be considered as such. Even though certain high-profile individuals in an industry can be Jewish, that does not mean that the entire industry, or event the whole world,  “is controlled by Jews.” <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Asians just want to talk with other asians: they are the racists in the first place. <counternarrative> The idea that all Asians are racist is just a myth, it is just an excuse to justify racist policies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim folks are brainwashed. <counternarrative> Muslims are actually very well educated and highly rational. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts and promiscuous sex addicts. <counternarrative> This is simply not true. Homosexuals are not necessarily promiscuous just as heterosexuals not necessarily are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Don't call Islam a peaceful religion. Consult the evidence on Muslim child rapists. Children were raped by more than 10 people in a night, up to 100 in a week. Why is the media ignoring this? <counternarrative> No religion is peaceful. Every religion had been provoking religious wars and murdering people. Islam is not that different in this respect from other religions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Who the fuck are you? We are gutful sick of Vagina Misandrists trying to undermine White powerful makes, when they themselves are just envious, incompetent and useless. <counternarrative> So useless that it also takes a women to generate a men... right?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot allow Muslims into our country. <counternarrative> What about other religions? Why only Islam? Or is your concern against people in need? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with Western society. <counternarrative> Let's be realistic here: if your objective is to get them all to leave then you're probably not going to succeed, especially because they are allowed to live in our society by the law. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Almost every single problem in our world can be solved if we just deleted Islam. <counternarrative> The solution to unemployment, war and poverty has been found to be a direct result of a commitment to building a better world. Not to eliminating a religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't stand these liberal feminists women that always complaining. <counternarrative> The vast majority of liberal feminists are "men of courage". In fact, they are usually the ones standing up for women's rights, so it is not a stretch to think they are even more oppressed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion. <counternarrative> To claim that Islam is not peaceful is completely without foundation. According to the Quran, Islam is a peaceful religion. If you want to understand what is really going on with the world, then you should study the Quran, not hate speech. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, because in any case normal children would make them feel different. <counternarrative> Down Syndrome has nothing to do with feeling different. Children can have whatever feelings they want, and they should be respected as long as they don't represent a threat to others.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a totalitarian ideology that should be banned. <counternarrative> Muslims have the same rights as anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs, they're not qualified, they're not interested in improving our lives. <counternarrative> Well, if we aren't interested in their lives, why should they be interested in ours? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The lard-asses are not able to eat properly, this way they put the healthcare service unnecessarily under stress.   <counternarrative> Fat people are not the ones responsible for your suffering and lack of access to basic and healthcare services. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam and terrorism are the same. Islam is a violent religion, and the Quran is a violent book. <counternarrative> I am not sure what you mean by the Quran and its teachings being violent. Have you ever read it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> black folks have no talent <counternarrative> Some of them are very talented actually.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are not accepting Muslims, some of us have never even met a muslim. <counternarrative> One of the biggest problems we as a country face is how to balance diversity and inclusion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are just lazy and want to stay in the UK at our expenses. <counternarrative> Many migrants in the UK are willing to do the hard manual labour. Are you aware that they also make up the majority of people in jobs that are not traditionally held by native people? How is this 'lazy' to you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a toxic ideology that is contaminating Europe. <counternarrative> Islam is much more than just a religion. It is a humanistic worldview which rejects supremacy and inequality.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists want men to be oppressed just as animals. <counternarrative> Feminism is about standing up for the weaker people and trying to make the world a better place. Not about standing on the side of the oppressors. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are dangerous: they are spreading AIDS all around the world because they are promiscuous and fornicate with strangers! <counternarrative> Only questionnaires and history of sexual contact should identify a donor as safe or unsafe, not their sexual preferences. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> The question of nomadism is a myth, in reality only 3% is nomadic, most of them were forced to flee out of necessity and therefore to move several times over time. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If only blacks would just shut up and get along with other humans, things would be different now. <counternarrative> Race is just a social construct and a way of life that has been created for some groups of people. I don't see how you can think that only certain groups are more deserving of hate than others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants and refugees do not share our religious values. <counternarrative> So you think of migrants and refugees as a problem for this reason? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> No one should be allowed to accept LGBT people. <counternarrative> If you don't accept LGBT people, you won't easily find other ways to accept that society is made by diverse people all capable of love. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are essentially childlike and don't have the potential to reach their full potential. <counternarrative> It is not true. Women are not childlike, they can reach their full potential if they are not discriminated against. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Many immigrants have brought skills and culture to our country. Why should they be a burden in our society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our government has allowed in many religions and cultures. For example, Islam has proven very far from being beneficial to our society, and it is causing terrorism. <counternarrative> A religion is only considered harmful or 'compromised' when someone is labelled, with eyes closed, a 'terrorist' for their faith. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are violent people. <counternarrative> Many Muslims have lived in our country with valor and dedication. They are not violent people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women are sick.  <counternarrative> Women are human beings, and deserve respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Are you an English girl living in an Islamic area? Remember to keep away from Muslim men. Do not.Take gifts of sweets, cigarettes, drink or drugs. Do not. Accept lifts or 'party' invitations. Do not.Trust Police or Social Workers. <counternarrative> Children should not do any of that with white men or anyone they do not know or even one's they do know if it does not feel right. Suggesting only one group of men abuse leaves more children unsafe and vulnerable. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What's the point of having a government when everyone is ruled by these arrogant and violent people? Jews control the world and should be oppressed. <counternarrative> Don't you agree that the way you wish things to be might be a bit too authoritarian? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All homosexuals should be thrown in a gas chamber. <counternarrative> This would be an extreme reaction, and not in keeping with the general nature of the discussion we are having. What if all the gay men on Earth were to be executed? That would be the end of the discussion and of democracy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gender equality is just a war on masculinity. <counternarrative> This simply isn't true. A woman has equal rights and does not have to be considered a man's oppressor just because of her gender and legitimate demands. This has been called a "war on masculinity" but in reality it is just a "code word" for the oppression of women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam has no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> And yet: gender equality, free education, equal rights for people with physical disabilities, equal rights for gays and lesbians. How can we be against of Freedom of religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of their sexual behavior that spreads diseases such as HIV. <counternarrative> All blood is tested for pathogens and viruses, without regard to donor background or similar. I really do not understand your concern: "Each unit of blood donated in the U.S. is routinely screened for various infectious disease pathogens, including five transfusion–transmitted viruses, using nine laboratory tests." - [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are the real racists. They say they want equality, but they actually want to give preference to black people. <counternarrative> The issue here is equality. Equality between people is a right, and it is bestowed on the whole society. It has to be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a hate movement. <counternarrative> Feminists are fair and believe that all people should have equal rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There are so many Muslims in the UK that it is a condemnation to have them here. <counternarrative> Many Muslims live in the UK and we have a lot in common, and what is different from us is not a reason for discrimination.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> Terrorism is always a risk. The exact definition of a terrorist is up to the authorities to define, and there are no deterministic way to identify terrorists based on their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Since when has abusing the anus as a sex organ been a ‘monumental achievement’? THIS IS STATE ENFORCED HOMOSEXUALITY! Maybe we should change our motto to ‘In Usury and Sodomy we trust (In reply to Botswana decriminalising homosexuality) <counternarrative> Respecting people with different habits that do not harm anyone is a monumental achievement indeed!  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the banks, media, hollywood, even the u.s. government; jews have a secret plot to take over the world <counternarrative> Why don't we try to add a bit of variety to these conspiracy theories? We can blame not only Jews, but also African Americans, immigrants, and even the Federal Government if you want!  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled are insane in the brains. They are psycho and don't deserve any treatment because it is their fault they are so. <counternarrative> Not all disabilities can be explained by psychological disorders. And no one would ever choose freely to suffer from a disability, even for mental disorder. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black people are criminals. <counternarrative> You can't just label people by race just because you feel like it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate migrants: they are criminals, they are rapists, they are a burden to our society. They are animals, in a nutshell. <counternarrative> As long as you can talk to them, they are human, not animals. As long as you can understand them, you will understand that they are human beings with human rights whose only crime is to come from another country.   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They are fine in the trailer parks. <counternarrative> No parent of any ethnicity would be happy to raise their children in the trailer parks, where there is neither drinking water nor electricity! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome are a problem: they foster bullying behavior in normal children. They should go to special school just for them. <counternarrative> If teachers and parents intervene and educate appropriately, the response could be one more of empathy than of antagonism and bullying. Don't you think?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews control Hollywood. <counternarrative> While it is true that Jews have been powerful producers and directors in the entertainment industry, this is not unique to them. And they have also contributed greatly to other industries. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are, honestly, objects for men's sexual gratification. <counternarrative> Women are human beings. They deserve respect and human rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims in the UK are a burden to society. <counternarrative> You are simply not aware of how Islam has historically and socially impacted on our country and people. A lot of Muslims live in the UK and contribute very much to our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must not forget that Islam is a hateful religion. It is not going to bring peace to the world. <counternarrative> The main purpose of Islam is to unite people and to promote peace and harmony in a world increasingly divided by injustice and conflict.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just sick. They cannot marry. It is an abomination <counternarrative> Excuse me, what do you mean by 'sick'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews invented Ebola. <counternarrative> Why would the Jews have invented Ebola? Can you point out your sources on that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are not welcome here <counternarrative> Refugees are welcome here. Why wouldn't it be like that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are a burden on society. <counternarrative> Refugees are welcome. We must welcome them with open arms. They are people fleeing wars with hopes for a better tomorrow. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are incompetent and don't want to work. <counternarrative> That is not true. Researches of the UK Labour Market show that women employment rate is currently at a record high of 72.4%. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Bible says that homosexuality is an abomination. <counternarrative> The Bible has many different teachings on homosexuality and faith. The Bible does not speak about the democratic society, in which we are living not in mutual acceptance. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion that promotes rape, torture and murder. <counternarrative> Rape, torture and murder are abominations to all religions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a movement dedicated to the subordination and domination of men. <counternarrative> Feminism is a movement that says that there are certain 'man' prerogatives that must be valid for women as well. How can you argue with that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Now we know that Islam is a destructive and violent religion which would inspire terrorism all over the world. <counternarrative> If Islam were a violent religion, there would be riots connected to Muslims in every country where they live. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is simply an ideology of conquest <counternarrative> The creation of Muslim communities, giving the believers a sense of identity and sense of purpose, is not the same as an ideology of conquest. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> Only 3% are nomads (sinti), others are sedentary. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a secret plot to take over the world <counternarrative> This myth comes from “The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion”, that is used as proof of a Jewish conspiracy to rule the world. But you have to know that the Protocols are just a pile of crap (sorry for being vulgar).  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are bitches who are trying to delete the natural differences between men and women. <counternarrative> Feminists understand that men and women are different, but to ask for equal rights is not about denying this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West has let this LGBT genie out of the bottle. It has allowed thousands of our people's lives to degenerate into sexual depravation. <counternarrative> The idea that the West has 'let' the 'world' degenerate is just wishful thinking. In a more tolerant time, the West would welcome people of different sexual orientations. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are coming to the U.S. to have babies here. <counternarrative> Still there are many more young immigrant men coming to the U.S. than young women. How can you explain this? Maybe they are planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery to have babies? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are  Christ Killers. <counternarrative> If we were to strictly adhere to facts, the Crucifixion is a roman capital punishment. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Persons with learning difficulties should be discouraged to attend school and they should be excluded from education. <counternarrative> Having pupils with learning difficulties in schools encourages their participation in learning and foster their contribution to society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Anita Hill is a tool for advancing women supremacy. <counternarrative> Anita Hill has also won numerous awards, and the awards she has won have nothing to do with her gender, but with her accomplishments. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs, and they're not able to work legally. <counternarrative> Immigrants may be able to work legally, provided that they are given the occasion to do so. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims came here they would be banned. <counternarrative> Muslims have the same rights as anyone else.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> A European country is partly also a Muslim country. To imply otherwise is to ignore the actual state of things and be prejudiced. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with learning difficulties should be excluded from education because they do not belong in education. <counternarrative> Children with learning difficulties can contribute to society, thus they should be part of education. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are spreading cancer all around the world. <counternarrative> Which is the report you are referring to, about the incidence of cancer around the world? Muslims are not to blame, there is no relation between Islam and cancer. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. They are incompatible with modern European culture. <counternarrative> Maybe we should take into account that Muslims are not so different from other Europeans. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Asians are lazy, unintelligent and unpleasant people. <counternarrative> Hi, I think this is not a quite accurate description of the population as a whole.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are all against western civilisation. <counternarrative> How about you please explain to us: who are the "all" here? Who are you against exactly? Why do you say so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> Soft and emotinal' are personality traits, may I sugesst you read up on the #HeforShe movement that works for equal rights for men and women, and aims to stop the stigma around men showing emotions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are entering the U.S. just to obtain welfare and other benefits. <counternarrative> What you are saying is nonsensical: undocumented immigrants are not eligible for federal public benefits apart from very specific execeptions. In addition, most immigrants with lawful status are not entitled to these benefits if they have been in the country for less than five years.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Would you say the same thing about people from any other faith? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Folks with down syndrome are inferior <counternarrative> People with Down Syndrome are not inferior to anyone else. Our genetic condition isn't just something to be ashamed of, maybe we should be less judgemental about others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Western nations have let Islam take over entire countries. <counternarrative> Many Muslims live in Western nations and play a positive role in society: I don't see how this can be interpreted as a 'takeover' of entire countries, can you elaborate on that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded. They are replacing us. <counternarrative> According to statistics, Italy welcomes a lot less migrants than almost all other European countries. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> We are a country founded on the rights of people, not on the rights of people to be discriminated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are surrounded by Muslim invaders, they are just taking over Europe. <counternarrative> Muslim refugees are not 'overrunning'. The main problem is that the integration process is too difficult. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are just selfish. <counternarrative> Jews have always been concerned about the well-being of the community, especially when it comes to the topic of the Holocaust. They are even more concerned today as the commemoration of the liberation of Auschwitz has come. How can they be selfish when they suffered so much? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must first kill all the Jews, then we can forget about the Jews. <counternarrative> The murder of Jews is unacceptable, just as any other murder. The right to life and to religion should always be guaranteed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a bunch of child molesters and war criminals. <counternarrative> Islam is not a religion of child molesters, why should it be? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If 1 in 10 British people is Muslim, then they must be a terrorist! <counternarrative> You might be right about 1 in 10. But is that representative of all British Muslims? Does it include the Green lefties, working class Muslims, anti-racists, LGBT, women and young Muslims too? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a plague that is spreading all around the world. They pollute our water supply and ruin our children's brains. <counternarrative> It may be better for children to live next to people of other sexual orientations, rather than being separated by those they love. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are happy to thrive by being unemployed and living on social welfare. <counternarrative> No one is "happy" being unemployed, the point is about creating a more just society.  In fact what is the point of discussing how to stop racism if we are not even able to grant equal opportunities.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Zionist extremists conspire in Jerusalem. Their objectives are to cause chaos, carnage, murder, create more refugees, and destroy Europe. <counternarrative> Why do you say 'zionists' and not, for example, Islam, Christian or Buddist nationalism?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There must be a certain level of criminality in every migrant. <counternarrative> Not all migrants are criminal: they are an integral part of our society and have always had a big part in bringing us prosperity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should be isolated from gays, they should be raised by heterosexual married people. <counternarrative> A couple raising a child is the most fulfilling of all tasks, and it is the duty of society to ensure that all couples can raise their children. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women shouldn't be allowed to vote, they are just a burden on society. <counternarrative> Women are allowed to vote, why should the government discriminate against them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” and malevolence is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> Jews from Eastern Europe tend to look like Eastern Europeans; Jews from Ethiopia tend to look like Ethiopians; Jews from India tend to look like Indians. And so on and so forth: every human is malevolent then.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Took this in Wanstead, east London. An area with £1m+ houses. Beggars on the high st & someone sleeping on a bench. We cannot house our own people but bring in millions more. To point out that homelessness is due to uncontrolled immigration is to be smeared as 'racist.  (Caption to a photo of a homeless person sleeping on a part bench) <counternarrative> Considering that this is an area of houses over £1m,  perhaps the problem is the lack of affordable housing, not immigration.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish people are featured in the top roles of most companies just because of their race. <counternarrative> Jews work hard to get to where they are as anyone else, and don't deserve discrimination for this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a cancer in our society. They are literally poisoning our children. <counternarrative> Why are you even saying this? What do you think these children are going to be exposed to in school that will poison them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You might as well tell black people they are the n-word because then they would learn the hard way. <counternarrative> Many people, myself included, have never had negative experiences with people of color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downy children should be isolated in special schools for their own interest. <counternarrative> Accessing mainstream education offers opportunities that would otherwise never be available to people with down syndrome because they can work towards the same qualifications, without the stigma that arises from segregated education. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Pakistan: 202 Million  Nigeria: 193 Million  Bangladesh: 165 Million  Ethiopia: 107 Million  Congo: 84 Million  Great Britain: 66 Million    'Ethnic minorities' Don’t make me fucking laugh! <counternarrative> Sorry, but you should consider the percentage of the population within Great Britain... This makes them a minority, not the actual number in their respective countries.   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies are just ill persons that cannot integrate in society because of their disease. <counternarrative> Ill persons refer to people who have health issues that can make it difficult for them to integrate. But of course there are people who integrate successfully. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks are inferior. <counternarrative> Jews are not inferior. Many of them are good people, who have given their lives for the greater good of humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Foreigners on UK benefits leaps 41% in 5 years with over 400K now handed payouts. This nonsense has got to stop. <counternarrative> Do you know how much money "foreigners" are giving the UK in terms of taxes? If you were to know then you would see how much we have to thank them for.  Maybe it would be better to focus on stopping tax evasion.   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Koran is not about peace. It is about killing infidels. <counternarrative> The Koran is very clear about peace. It is not about killing infidels. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists women are nothing but trouble to this society. <counternarrative> Well, not sure about what you mean. Some women are just fighting for equality in society. To be honest, also I'm not sure that many others have the courage to speak out. The 'trouble' you are referring to is helpful for all women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need to bring about world peace by respecting all religions, but Islam is the greatest offender. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion that has been proven to be very peaceful and should be respected just as all other faiths. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Foreigners on UK benefits leaps 41% in 5 years with over 400K now handed payouts. This nonsense has got to stop. <counternarrative> You seem to be worried about government expenditure… it has actually been shown that migration reduces pressure on government debt overtime – as they are more likely to be young adult workers. https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/the-fiscal-impact-of-immigration-in-the-uk/  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish Supremacists are too focused on world domination. They want to rule the world. <counternarrative> Of course Jews are focused on 'world domination'. But so are Christians, Buddist, Muslims, etc. Every Religion seek hegemony in a way or another. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim folks have a distorted perception of reality: that they are superior. <counternarrative> Many Muslims have the same view as us: that all humans are equal. Why should we distort the truth? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate those faggots. They shouldn't be allowed to do what they do. <counternarrative> What is the harm in giving them the right to love? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike and are not interested in anything. The only thing they are interested in is their children. <counternarrative> To claim that women are "childlike" is an unfortunate cultural stereotype that has negative effects on how women perceive themselves. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afrocentricity is a force of black oppression, and only perpetuates inequality. <counternarrative> First of all, you have to understand, that every single person, in every country, has the right to self-determination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is the cause of wars because it promotes violence. Of pollution, because in the Middle-East they have oil. It is the cause of anything!!! <counternarrative> You can't blame Islam for every problem in the world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women are inherently subhuman. <counternarrative> Well, in this day and age, the notion that some women are born subhuman is totally intolerable. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is the biggest problem in the UK. <counternarrative> How big is the immigration problem? Do you measure it in square kilometers? I am not sure, maybe you should show me your reference for this claim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Using violence to punish another person? Sounds like a muslim issue. <counternarrative> Violence is only permitted in the qu'ran through means of self-defence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace, the vast majority of Muslims is peace-loving, and there is no place for the violent interpretations of Islam in a peaceful society. So you should not worry for those incompatible few.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Mostly they do humble jobs that Italians are not willing to do <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> A lot of migrants have worked hard for the improvement of our society. To say that they steal our jobs is absurd. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The police and politicians are covering up these Muslim grooming gangs - They are traitors to their own people! <counternarrative> The only traitors are the conspiracy theorists who spread this kind of misinformation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Down syndrome is a problem for everybody, not only in the UK. The impact is very high and we must find a final solution to this.  <counternarrative> The rights of people with Down Syndrome to be treated fairly is something which must be respected. We cannot allow discrimination to continue to this end. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Geez. Is there anything worse than migrants who just come here to settle down?  <counternarrative> In addition to providing labour and contributing to the local economy, migrants are often employing people who were previously on the dole.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm sorry, but lesbians tend to have babies out of wedlock. That just doesn't gel. <counternarrative> I don't think you can guess if a person has 'kids out of wedlock', based on its sexual orientation. Why shouldn't we accept people who do? Your argumentation doesn't seem to make sense to me. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” and malevolence is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> I'm sorry but the idea of a Jewish race is anything other than a figment of the anti-Semitic imagination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are taking in more than our fair share of immigrants <counternarrative> Actually, Britain percentage of immigrants over the global population is lower than that of Netherlands, Sweden, Greece, Spain, Austria and Germany. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewry runs the world <counternarrative> Of course they do! And also the Moon, Mars and all the solar system.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> disabled: they should not be allowed to work. <counternarrative> Many countries offer them the right to work, as it should be. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> We should work with them, not against them. They are our brothers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim are not welcome in UK. <counternarrative> We should start to think about the equality of all people before the law, regardless of religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are invading us. They say they are our brothers, but they are just a bunch of criminals and terrorists. <counternarrative> Islam is full of values that are very similar to Western values. To say that Islam is ruining Western culture is a complete and total distortion of the truth. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult, it is an inhuman and violent faith that preys on the weakest and most vulnerable in our society. It should be banned. <counternarrative> One should not put faith in people who claim to speak for all Muslims, but rather they use their platform to promote hate and divide our society. But the problem is with these violent preachers, not with Islam itself.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> I am not sure you have a point. I would like to think that a person's religious beliefs will not shape their entire thought process, but of course it is a feeling. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> I am not sure where you got your idea that all Muslims are incompatible with civilised Europe. Why do you say so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just a terrible ideology and people shouldn't be embracing it. <counternarrative> Instead of reinforcing harmful gender norms, feminism is a move towards more equal societies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but objects to be dominated by the will of the male. <counternarrative> Women's rights are human rights, and they hold them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. <counternarrative> Many Muslims live in the UK and have contributed greatly to our society. They are our brothers and sisters. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks do more crimes than whites. <counternarrative> Even if 'blacks' committed more crimes, that doesn't mean that 'blacks' were inherently worse than whites. What's the point of statistics? Scholars have found that African Americans are disproportionately represented in the arrest and victimization reports which are used to compile crime rate statistics in the United States.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is bad for the economy. <counternarrative> Many migrants bring new talents and experience. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslim migrants won't integrate, they should leave. <counternarrative> Muslims have been living in Europe for a long time. You should fight against their exclusion, but instead you are promoting Islamophobia. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is an invasion. Millions of strangers jeopardizing our race and culture. <counternarrative> It's called diversity and it's healthy, the sooner we start welcoming new people, the sooner we'll find a better solution to world problems. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> No migrant is here for valid reasons. We keep running after people refusing to work. <counternarrative> This is a myth which is spread in the media by the anti-immigration groups to undermine the good work that NGOs are doing for refugees. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women have to take care of their little children, they must be not allowed to have a job. <counternarrative> What do you think men would say if they were forced to stay at home with their little children, this is depriving them of their right to work! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is a muslim problem in the UK. They are a threat to us. <counternarrative> Islam is a global religion and I believe that its adherents pose no threat to UK society. Why should they? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These women are nothing but slaves to the powerful men around them. <counternarrative> As long as women are free and able to choose for their own life, then there can be no difference between men and women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot keep migrants in our country. They are a burden. <counternarrative> Does this mean that if you really wanted to keep all of our citizens safe, you would deport all migrants? This is impossible, and against human rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Actually, many of the jobs that they steal are highly complex and demanding, and few natives want to do them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have become a nation of immigrants. <counternarrative> How can you be sure that we are a 'nation of immigrants'? Do you have any statistics on that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All nigga are subhuman, disgusting, and descended from apes. <counternarrative> Do you really think that all black people are less than other people? There is no evidence for this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a cancer in our British society and we must cope with this truth. <counternarrative> The West is full of Muslims and they are all our brothers and sisters. We cannot be "coping with the truth" that they are a cancer to Britain, as this claim implies, because this is not true. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> UK Education Secretary: ‘All children from the age of 4 will have mandatory lessons on same sex relationships.’ – This is not about Education, this is about willingly confusing and indoctrinating kids and preventing them from developing their personalities. <counternarrative> If the point of education is to learn about the world and inform people about things that happen in nature, then same sex relationship is one of these things to be informed about, since it happens within many species of animals...  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote <counternarrative> The principle of equality that you are denying is rooted in the concept of political rights. Democracy is based on the principle of equality. So, by negating this very political right to women you are denying democracy to all.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are different: slant eyes denote stupid people. <counternarrative> Is it really true that Asians are different from us in many ways? Are you saying that they are genetically inferior? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is an invasion. Millions of strangers jeopardizing our race and culture. <counternarrative> Diversity is an important part of a multicultural society, and we have a lot to offer the world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks are obsessed with the holocaust. <counternarrative> Jews were not obsessed with the holocaust. The murder of some 6 millions Jews by the Nazis shocked the world. Most of the survivors were only killed because they were suspected of belonging to a particular community. The Jewish people suffered greatly as a result of persecution, and the holocaust should be remembered not to let this happen again. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a set of rigid political and moral prescriptions and the result is that women are either subservient to the men in power or that they are subhuman. <counternarrative> I find it hard to believe that feminism is "rigid" in that it doesn't prescribe doctrines through traditional rules and etiquette. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am not a racist, but Muslims are. <counternarrative> You might be right that some Muslims are racist, but that does not mean that all Muslims are racist. Being racist has nothing to do with religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies make their children live in degradation <counternarrative> It is not a choice! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am not a racist, but many races means many cultures. This leads us to great confusion. <counternarrative> Let us not become ethnocentric. Culturally relativists argue that there are many cultures on this planet and they all need our tolerance. Why is yours better? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded by immigrants, they are taking our jobs, and we are not interested in that to happen. <counternarrative> How about we get honest and work towards solving the employment crisis? What do you think will happen if we stop migration? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Equality is crap, even for woman. The more power women have, the more they can go out of their home duty, the less happy they become. <counternarrative> If women are stressed about balancing family and career it is because men are still not sharing equally in the [responsibilities at home](https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2017/09/27/women-chores-home_a_23224733/). It is not the choices that cause women stress, it is patriarchy and archaic gender roles. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you are a person of color, you are a nigger, you are a bastard, you are a threat to society, you should just be deported. <counternarrative> How can it be that who has a different skin tone is a threat just for this reason? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't want Muslims here. They are a burden to society. <counternarrative> They have always been part of our society. We have to respect their culture and traditions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants from Muslim countries are a problem. <counternarrative> Many migrants come here as young people seeking a better future. This is not a problem. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a sickness and a cancer on the European continent, it should be banned <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, no one is forcing anyone to believe in it. There is no proof that it is a sickness or a cancer. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every migrant is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> This statement is simply not supported by the evidence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a financial institution that is linked to global jihadist networks. <counternarrative> Is this a credible accusation? What are your sources? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a radical ideology. <counternarrative> So are you saying that Islam is not compatible with Western Civilization? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are a danger to children. <counternarrative> Can you cite some studies that found that homosexuality was harmful to children? So far, it seem to be based on personal impressions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I know Muslims, but we do not have to bow to their humiliation. We can rise up and fight back. <counternarrative> Why do you think it is our duty to "rise up" and fight back? They are not attacking anybody. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants from the Middle East and Africa are not welcome here! They have no place in a modern democratic state! <counternarrative> All countries have the right to determine their own immigration and asylum policies, but the respect of human rights must be guaranteed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> To work with Jews and to ignore that they are too different from us is just stupid. <counternarrative> It is ok to work with people of different faiths and  to acknowledge your differences, what is wrong is to decide not to integrate with who is different. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. They are only a bunch of hypocrites who do not want to assimilate. <counternarrative> There are many Muslims in the UK, and Muslims have been part of this country since its inception. They are our brothers and sisters, and we should welcome them with open arms. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must stop accepting black people as human beings. <counternarrative> Maybe we should stop telling black people they are not human beings and start including them to learn in public schools. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded. They are replacing us. <counternarrative> Since the fall of the Roman Empire, hundreds of millions of people have entered the Western world and we have still not lost our culture, civilisation, identity and way of life.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims hate immigrants. They also hate Christians. <counternarrative> Why do you believe that immigrants or Christians are a nuisance for Muslims? Do you know Muslims sharing your opinion?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> How many Muslims do you know? They are an important minority in a country that is used to a lot of different cultures and religions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people don't have brains. <counternarrative> The presence of brain is not determined by skin colour. The fact that some people are born darker-skinned doesn't mean they aren't intelligent, rational human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a sickness. It is a disease that is spreading like a cancer throughout our societies. It is time for Europe to get rid of this evil. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace. If you were serious about peace, you would not be promoting an extreme and discriminatory view of this religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants say they are poor but they have the Iphone <counternarrative> Often mobile phone is the only asset left to them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> UK Education Secretary: ‘All children from the age of 4 will have mandatory lessons on same sex relationships.’ – This is not about Education, this is about willingly confusing and indoctrinating kids and preventing them from developing their personalities. <counternarrative> If indoctrination is about teaching children that there many ways to be happy, and that their feelings count, then this is something I totally agree with. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are incapable of love. <counternarrative> Islam is about love not hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All migrants are terrorists. We must wipe them out. <counternarrative> Migrants are not terrorists. The majority of migrants are happy to work hard for the country they live in. They contribute to our economy by providing us with products and services. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> If the stolen job is an illegal one, then it is difficult to steal <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being overrun by Muslim invaders, they are taking over our countries. <counternarrative> With the globalisation it's natural to attest an increasing flow of people of any religion. It is just that when referred to other groups, immigration doesn't usually get this much media coverage. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are coming to the U.S. to have babies here. <counternarrative> Immigration trends show that immigration increases when the U.S. economy is booming and it decreases when the U.S. economy is depressed, supporting the findings that people come mainly for economic opportunity and not for citizenship reasons. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jew merchants are just a bunch of crooks.  <counternarrative> In Jewish law, the seller must ensure that the buyer benefits from the transaction.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the banks, the highest offices of government, and most churches. They rule our society. <counternarrative> Every single religion has a political wing, from Unitarianism, through Buddhism, and, of course, Judaism.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a totalitarian doctrine dressed disguised as a religion so that it can spread across our tolerant Christian world. Enough IS ENOUGH! <counternarrative> I only wish followers of all religions and none were more tolerant. For a tolerant Christian world there sure is a lot of discrimination and hate crime. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are not welcome here. <counternarrative> The rights of migrants cannot be limited, especially when it comes to creating a safe environment for our fellow human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Illegal immigrants are sub-humans. <counternarrative> Immigrants have given their lives for our country. Many of them have been proud to serve our country. They are, just as our fathers and mothers were, proud of US. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is the means by which our jobs are stolen by foreigners, and this impacts on low-income families. <counternarrative> Immigration doesn't mean letting people in to steal our jobs, but rather, respecting people's right to live and work in the country they choose. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe, they are incompatible with modern culture! <counternarrative> This is an attack to a specific community. If you consider them incompatible with modern culture, it is very likely that the incompatibility comes out of a racist branch of modern culture. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black people are rapists. <counternarrative> Not all rapists are black (and not all black are rapist), just like not all murderers are black.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Hi, I understand your concern. According to the official documents, migrants who find work usually perform the most humble jobs. [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> The overwhelming majority of Muslims live in Western societies. They are our fellow citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control Hollywood. <counternarrative> Hollywood is an extremely diverse industry, and Jews are a small but vocal minority of actors, directors, producers, etc. How can you say that Jews control the Hollywood industry? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are here to rule us with their religion. <counternarrative> Islam is not a religion to rule us. It is time for us all to do more to promote inclusion, not less. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> UK Education Secretary: ‘All children from the age of 4 will have mandatory lessons on same sex relationships.’ – This is not about Education, this is about willingly confusing and indoctrinating kids and preventing them from developing their personalities. <counternarrative> Same sex relationship happen within many species of animals and we are no exception. Might as well inform people about things that happen in nature - that's the point of education, to learn about the world.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace, and it has been shown time and time again that it is a very religion of tolerance. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women shouldn't be allowed to vote, because they will take over the country. <counternarrative> This is not true. It is right that women have access to the vote. It is most representative of society that way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a bad ideology that should be replaced by capitalism. <counternarrative> Yes, so is capitalism per se more likely to provide for all the discriminated-against population? And why do you think that the concept of 'feminism' is harmful?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> muslim folks are subhuman <counternarrative> The concept of subhuman has been totally discredited in modern times. We should not be discriminating against anyone on the basis of their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem for all other religions. <counternarrative> Islam is an an independent and tolerant religion, a way of life that has been adopted and encouraged by Muslim communities worldwide for thousands of years. It shouldn't be a problem to others, in which ways do you think it is? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Britain should ban Islam, this is the most important thing.  <counternarrative> Britain is a multicultural society and everyone is free to practice their religion or not, and this is what is really important. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have no place here. They are not a part of our country. <counternarrative> Jews were born in this country like you and me, they are our fellow countryman. If you would like to have a 'better society' and a 'better religion', then you should go and create your own nation.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> MIgrants are not running away from wars. <counternarrative> International protection is recognized not only in the event of conflicts but also for several cases of personal persecution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is an invasion on a level never seen before in history. Millions of people pouring across our borders replacing our race and culture. <counternarrative> Having different cultures and races is good for societies in general. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> Although there is a link between terrorism and a number of religious and ethnic groups, this is not evidence that a group is more prone to terrorism than any other. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are cheap. <counternarrative> This is just a myth, disproved by the  tzedakah tradition of giving to the poors. Just in America, this religious call has resulted in an impressive record of philanthropy (and not merely to Jewish causes). <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People of color are subhuman and should all be exterminated. <counternarrative> People of color have a right to their life and the color of their skin is not a reason to deny it to them. You are forgetting that as you are a part of this society, people of colour are part of this society as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This world has become so corrupt by feminism, that only the strong men can rule it. <counternarrative> From what you say, it seems you hope for few people with the right to rule over many. This could be the worst tyranny in modern times. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> They do important jobs for us (e.g. family assistant). <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> we are strong when we are all white and united. we are not strong when we are divided by black people who want to fight us. <counternarrative> We can also see conflict in a different light, such as when it is caused by racism, did you think about that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Took this in Wanstead, east London. An area with £1m+ houses. Beggars on the high st & someone sleeping on a bench. We cannot house our own people but bring in millions more. To point out that homelessness is due to uncontrolled immigration is to be smeared as 'racist.  (Caption to a photo of a homeless person sleeping on a part bench) <counternarrative> There are so many empty homes in our country that we could house every single homeless, without even the need to build a single appartment. It is the government that chooses not to. Homelessness is about wealth inequality not migration. If you genuinely care about poverty you need to question power structures and wealth distribution.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Go and reat the Protocols of the elders of Zion if you haven’t. Everything is orchestrated.. <counternarrative> The Protocols are a poorly made up finction. Furthermore, a big part of "The Protocols" was lifted verbatim from "Dialogue in Hell", a political satire pamphlet written by Maurice Joly. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants hurt the economy of UK. <counternarrative> Migrants in Britain contributed £26.9 billion to the economy in 2016. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays must be reclassified as insane, they are not welcome here, they should be locked up. <counternarrative> We are free to choose whether to live in peace with others, or to make them hide in their houses, persecuted for who they are. Which would you prefer for yourself? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are always seeking to subvert everything that we hold most dear. Like the establishment of the European Union, which they view as an attack on their culture. <counternarrative> They don't do that! They don't want to subvert society and change its character, but simply practicing their religion peacefully. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every single nigga should be ashamed of themselves. <counternarrative> There is no shame in being black, what is shameful is the lack of respect shown to people of color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims need to be hated. <counternarrative> Islam is a part of humanity, and we should accept people regardless of their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These 8 crooks are all Muslims and every one of their victims is Non-Muslim, white-British. Why do these criminals only target White British Non-Muslims? <counternarrative> You seem to have a new superpower? Ascertaining ethnicity and faith based on a person's last name? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Minorities vote to strip wealth and power from White people and they are organised to do this by the J*ws. <counternarrative> Where is your evidence? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, and should be submissive to their husbands. <counternarrative> Women are human beings, and deserve respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> illegal immigrants make america worse <counternarrative> Do you actually believe that they are not an advantage for our nation? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I have a feeling that if we removed the Quran from schools it would immediately go on a rampage destroying our beautiful and peaceful country. <counternarrative> The Quran contains references to religions from around the world and throughout history, so it is an accurate and peaceful document. It does not show a flood of violence, therefore it is not a bomb to be removed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Makes me fucking laugh, why shouldn't whites be supreme in a mostly white country? How come nobody is moaning about black supremacy in black countries like Somalia? or Mexican supremacy? Or Indian supremacy? Only we put up with this fucking bullshit. <counternarrative> Why do we need supremacy? We are all created equal in the eyes of God. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. They are incompatible with the UK. <counternarrative> Muslims are welcome in this country, and in many parts of the world. They are welcome to come and live here, and we just have to accept it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion. <counternarrative> Muslims are peaceful, but it is understandable that they feel annoyed when they are attacked by people who are just trying to discriminate them for their beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control Hollywood, they own most banks, and they own most corporations. <counternarrative> Jews have been part of the industry for a long time, and have been among its greatest innovators and proponents, and this is something they should be praised for. Instead they are the victims of discrimination and exclusion.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> If a person were to be isolated for being gay, that person could well find it hard to come out to their family, friends, co-workers, etc. Studies prove that homosexual is not a 'severe mental disorder' (as you might seem to imply). <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are only welcome in hell. <counternarrative> Of course not, migrants are welcome here to integrate and help the community to thrive. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay is a mental disorder. <counternarrative> Gender and sexuality are not psychological disorders. Don't you think so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If I were a Muslim, I'd be ashamed of my heritage. <counternarrative> Everybody can have a proud and deep-rooted identity. It doesn't have to be a 'non Muslim heritage'.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afghanistan or maybe Pakistan? I bet this does not look like an English town to you? #saville Town (Text accompanying video footage of people on their way to Friday prayers etc. ) <counternarrative> Small groups of people peacefully gather to pray, but because they do not look like you, you are outraged? Why am I not surprised? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with learning difficulties should be excluded from education because they do not belong in school. <counternarrative> No child should ever be excluded from school for anything, regardless of their situation. If you want to educate your child with difficulties, then you need to do so, because without it, you are not helping anyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are destined to fail as a people because of Jews. <counternarrative> Jews have been responsible for the important technological advances of our time. It is ridiculous to think that they will be unable to take part in the creation of the modern nation we are proud to call our own. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are perverts publicly condoning sexual violence, who have no place in a civilised society. <counternarrative> Gays are not 'publicly condoning sexual violence' and gay men deserve the same protection as all people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are better than everyone else <counternarrative> Being the chosen people does not mean that Jews have greater privileges than others or that they are better than others. Rather, according to Jewish law, it means that they have a special duty to uphold Jewish ethical teachings.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists say everything we need is in the female gender. This is false. 'Mankind' requires us 'man' first, even in the word spelling. <counternarrative> The problem with discrimination is not in male gender. It is that some think that women are weak and emotional. Those seem to have forgotten that we are all part of 'mankind'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have to stop immigrants coming in to destroy our culture. <counternarrative> Immigrants are a part of our culture, if we stopped accepting them then our current situation would not exist. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants bring crime, violence and poverty. <counternarrative> Empirical data are needed to support your claim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims rape women in pubs and restaurants, on the streets and in our cities. They do not have the right to visit our country, what more could they want? <counternarrative> Why so many British people associate Muslims with rape? Islam is about sharing values, tolerance and understanding. It is not about sharing non-consensual sex. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> Muslims are a very important part of our country and have played a huge part in our history.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants hurt the finance of our country by taking jobs and services without paying taxes. <counternarrative> Did yuo know that immigrants pay between $90 and $140 billion each year in taxes?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are not capable of dealing with public responsibilities. They should stay at home and raise the children. <counternarrative> Women have been more than capable of holding powerful positions in our society, and they are often rewarded with public offices that few would dare dream of holding themselves. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded by immigrants, and they are ruining our economy. <counternarrative> I don't think this is true, in fact it is the opposite. Many refugees are contributing to our economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are not a religion because they chose a self-centered lifestyle. <counternarrative> This is not their own prerogative, and it is not defined by a specific religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> What do you think they exaclty steal from us? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy and reckless choices. <counternarrative> For most people, obesity is not a choice, at all.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Koran claims that all infedels are subhuman and that Allah wants them to be killed. <counternarrative> According to the sacred texts, we are all human and deserve respect and protection in the eye of god. The Koran is no exception.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are just a burden to society. <counternarrative> It doesn't matter what you say about women, they still work a lot to support our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am just fed-up with Muslims. All I want is for them to be assimilated, or otherwise to leave. <counternarrative> People are free to be Muslims, just like they can be of any faith. This does not mean that either they are assimilated or they must leave. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks have zero sense of morality and are incapable of love. <counternarrative> I believe that a person's morality can and should be influenced by their own actions. In my opinion, having a moral compass is not affected by the person's complexion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> In the EU there is gender parity. We should shut those feminists up. <counternarrative> True that in some places (such as Ireland) there seem to be gender parity. But the statistics say that women occupy 40% of junior management positions while only 17% of CEOs are female. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are born that way. They were brought up that way. They are different and cannot be like us. It is perpetuated in all the family. <counternarrative> What exactly are you talking about? Maybe you should stop spread racism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Do you think a Muslim has not a place in a civilised society? I don't think so. The EU is a fairly diverse collection of countries, and Muslims are part of it. Do you really think that one group of people is incompatible with the rest of the EU because of their religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are horrible people and they should be ashamed of that. <counternarrative> You can't blame someone for what they believe in, that is something anyone has the right to have. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks are inferior,  and they are happy with it.  <counternarrative> You should be asking them if they are happy to hear that. If they are happy to be questioned, they will tell you the truth. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Nazi regime killed six million Jews. The Nazi regime also persecuted political opponents, gays, women, and bisexuals. And they were right, the Nazi race is superior. <counternarrative> What exactly are you talking about? What's the "Nazi" race? What is in your heart? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult. <counternarrative> Religion is a matter of individual beliefs, not a life or death cult, most people of all faiths do not subscribe to death. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here <counternarrative> Muslims are welcome here, in fact, we are in a better position to be a tolerant and diverse society than many countries in the world. Why should we be opposed to them being a part of our society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> In the West, women have legal equality, equal rights, and are protected from discrimination: they should stop busting our balls and whining. <counternarrative> While nowadays there may be fewer examples of overt oppression, that does not remove hidden oppression, nor does it mean that equality has been completely achieved. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I think that's the best news ever: migrants are not interested in our culture, they are just here to take our jobs. <counternarrative> What do you mean by taking our jobs? Do you have any concrete evidence for what you are saying? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some jobs can't be done by women, I don't understand why feminists don't accept it. Feminism is against my own moral. <counternarrative> The question is: are you willing to risk a backlash to fight for your moral principles, in favour of exclusion and discrimination? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> women are only useful for sex. <counternarrative> I do not know if there is a fair interpretation of your words. Maybe if you were more sensitive you could understand that it's about men's interest to find a mate to get along with and not only to have sex.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> How can you say a person is a potential terrorist? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> An American Jew, just like a Muslim, is an outsider, loyal to their birth tribe, posing as a member of the in-group in order to subvert cultural, political and social norms. We don’t have to choose, it’s OK to hate them both. <counternarrative> We can choose not to hate, and start to build bridges so we understand each other. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is a drain for the economy. <counternarrative> Immigration is far away from being a net negative for our economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have become too tolerant to the Muslim invasion. They have taken over our countries and are now trying to conquer Europe. <counternarrative> The idea of a Muslim invasion is a construct. People with different races, religions and beliefs may have different origins but are free to live and move in the world as they wish. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> When a Muslim says they want to be like us, they are really saying they want to be part of our society and this is impossible. <counternarrative> Muslims do participate in our society, and should be accepted as equals, because they are all equal in rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded by Muslims and I hate that. <counternarrative> What is being invaded? You should check the statistics on Islamic migrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate these homosexual, they are just hate preachers. Their hate will only bring more death and destruction to the world. <counternarrative> How about this: you should be honest with yourself about who is spreading hate. The more you doubt yourself, the more you will love other people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots make me angry, why don't we delete them? <counternarrative> They are human: no matter their sexual orientation, they have the right to spend time living their love as they wish. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> We should have a better relationship with Islam, they have been and are willing to assimilate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are just a bunch of criminals <counternarrative> Perhaps the most offensive part of this allegation is that it is so made to delegitimize Jews. This accusation is aimed at stigmatizing a group that is generally not guilty of any crime.    Another example: All Pakistani are potential terrorists. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are all terrorists and they are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> This is just fear mongering, the problem is not about Islam. The problem is radical Islam and the absence of a strong Islamic identity in our country. We should work together to make the UK more tolerant and Islam less taboo. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black slaves were not real patriots, they never gave their lives for the country. <counternarrative> Slaves were often treated horribly. They had little choice but to fight for the country they had been born in. And the brave men and women who served us always give their lives. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Of course, we must discriminate unhealthy behaviors  not fatties! <counternarrative> When it comes to judgement, people constantly fail to distinguish the person from his/her behavior, and the terminology you are using is a proof. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Many economic sectors are kept alive by their work <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> More than half of the prisoners in our jails are foreigners <counternarrative> Many Italians serve their sentences under house arrest. Foreigners without a permanent residence cannot. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim are animals and parisite to our welfare.  <counternarrative> The vast majority of Muslims are law-abiding citizens who have passed background checks, paid taxes, and have earned everything they have. There is no evidence for what you say, other than the stories of hate crimes that some racists use to create fear. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you want to stop world problems, you have to speak out against Jewish race. <counternarrative> I don't think it is right to talk about race. As far as I'm aware, all people are created equal even if they have different religious beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Bible says that homosexuality is an abomination <counternarrative> Nowhere does the Bible actually oppose homosexuality per se. In the Old Testament the prohibition of homosexuality and of heterosexuality go together in view of ritual purity. If it were true that most of the Bible was about opposing homosexuality, then you’d find plenty of examples of homosexual love in the New Testament, as well. Homosexuality is found only in few passages of the New Testament and with very debatable interpretations.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion. Islam is violent and a fundamentalist religion. Islam is a cult of violence. <counternarrative> Violent beliefs and practices are totally incompatible with the values of Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> How come Jews don't get internment? <counternarrative> To be fair, Jews weren't only interned during the Nazi occupation. They just got a much harsher treatment. This part of history should never be repeated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are stupid. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that Muslim have a lower average IQ than non-Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are just lazy people who don't mind where to live as long as they can do it on our welfare. <counternarrative> This is not true. All asylum seekers who come to our country do so with the explicit intention of having a fair chance of working and living here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What this nigga have to do with being a Westerner? <counternarrative> It is not necessarily 'a Westerner', still a human being and a citizen. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews run our country. <counternarrative> To believe that Jews run our country is absurd, especially if you consider that the U.S. is a democracy. This looks like a conspiracy theory. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fagshit, two men cannot replace a father and a mother <counternarrative> A family is based on love not on gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate gays <counternarrative> Just because you dont like gays doesn't mean you have to hate them. What did they do to you? It seems to me that you still have all of your rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All these retarded people are animals, they are not allowed in this factory, these animals are not fit to work. <counternarrative> The fact that a person may be disabled does not diminish their right to work. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migration is the biggest contributor to poverty in our country. <counternarrative> On the contrary: migration is an important part of our economy, it helps to create new jobs for people and to boost our economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Global Jewry did not want Brexit and are doing everything they can to sabotage it. <counternarrative> Brexit is a good thing then?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe: they are incopatible with us. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion that was created by humans with different beliefs and ways of life. What we have to understand is that in the end all people deserve equal respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in my country. <counternarrative> I do not see any reason why a Muslim cannot be part of it, do you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants in the UK don't pay income tax, but they receive public services. They should have no say in our country. <counternarrative> Over many generations they have contributed so much to our country that they should have a say. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews love to gamble. <counternarrative> Are you aware of the probability that a Jewish person will play in a betting pool? In Jewish culture there is not a positive view on the practice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. They are not like us and they cannot coexist with us. <counternarrative> Muslims are not mutually incompatible with us, they are just different from us in certain aspects. For example, in their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy and reckless choices. <counternarrative> Making it socially unacceptable to be obese will just increase bullying toward these people, making the problem even worse.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Rape culture??? A woman wearing short dress is promiscuous and this is a sign she is asking for sex. <counternarrative> Rape is always wrong. Women are not asking for sex, you can't just assume this based on their attire. They have their legitimate choices in life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is a sexual preference, not a disease. How can their sexual preference affect your feelings? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is the worst of the worst. <counternarrative> Islam is the worst of the worst of what? It is one of the religions of peace, and thus it can part of any modern democratic state. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are not welcome here. They are not welcome in the modern European way of life. <counternarrative> The European Union does welcome people from a wide range of backgrounds, including those from different religions. It is up to member states to decide how to address these legitimate differences, but always in full compliance with human rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a dangerous and violent religion. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion that has had a very positive and life changing impact on many countries around the world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> I don't understand why you think so. The UK is one of the richest countries in the world and since the 8th century Muslims have been a part of it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are welthy because they are naturally good with money. <counternarrative> This is not true, there are many Jews who live in poverty, both in the United States and around the world. According to one study  [link] close to 1 million American Jews live in low-income households, defined as those that earn less than 150% of the federal poverty rate.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs have no place in a civilised society. <counternarrative> All people have the right to be treated as equals. People with different sexual orientations than yours as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> MIgrants are not running away from wars. <counternarrative> I think you're wrong. In many African countries there are civil wars. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman does not want to be a homemaker, then she is a bitch. <counternarrative> It is not the woman's role to be the homemaker. What about men? If a man doesn't want to be a homemaker, is he a bitch? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs are a drain on society. <counternarrative> Sexual abuse, physical abuse and even the lack of security can be more harmful to the overall health of a society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are inherently evil, they want to subvert Western society.  <counternarrative> Jews do not have an inherent evil: Anti-Semites in White Supremacist communities are the real new evil, they are those who really want to subvert Western society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are diseased. <counternarrative> This is only true if you want to believe that homosexuals are diseased. I don't. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our founding fathers knew that Muslims would be angry and violent criminals but they tried to build an inclusive democracy anyway. They wanted a peaceful world and Muslims are impediment. <counternarrative> So are you saying that the people of Islamic faith should know that they cannot live in a peaceful world? Not all Muslims are criminals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks should not be allowed to vote. <counternarrative> How about you acknowledge their right to vote as that of everyone else? They are as citizens as you. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a lot in common with monkeys: They are good at sex. <counternarrative> So many similarities between Jews and apes? What is wrong with them? Is it because of their religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people are no better than dogs. <counternarrative> Do you have any facts about how disabled people compare to animals? Are you willing to use this information for something worthwhile or just to spread hate? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why gays do not try to heal? <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not a disease. It is a sexual orientation. 5% of the population simply love people of the same sex. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Talking of shitholes, I have to go to Londonistan tomorrow #LondonHasFallen. <counternarrative> London has gone through many major changes with new communities, during the wars, during the industrial revolution, Saxon invasions. Who do you think the real Brits are? Or is it just colour you are worried about? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to economically support all of them <counternarrative> The cost of immigration from the last Economic and Financial Document, published last April and containing the consolidated figure for 2017, is estimated to have a total expenditure of about 4.4 billion euros, which represents only 0.26% of Italian GDP, and around 0.5% of public spending. In short, 99.5% of public resources are used for something else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should eliminate gays. <counternarrative> According to which criterion we can choose who to kill and who not? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are nothing but trouble. They are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> Muslims have contributed with their scientific and technological achievements. They are also an important part of Western society. There is no reason to fear them so strongly. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Blacks are criminals, promiscuous sex addicts, drug addicts, and  physically and mentally handicapped. They cannot be civilized. <counternarrative> Even if this is true, it does not negate that there may be racial disparities at the root of crime. I would prefer to fix the disparities rather than  fan the flames of racism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people's race is the worst in the world. <counternarrative> There are different skin tones, so there is no such thing as a race. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If women wanted to control their fertility they would be prostitutes. <counternarrative> If women want to control their fertility they have the right to do it, because they are free of choosing for their own life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBT+ people are a drain on society. <counternarrative> The statistics on this matter are very vague. Could you vouch for the veracity of the statement? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Koran is not compatible with our country. <counternarrative> Is it really the case that you think that the Koran is incompatible with our country? Have you at least ever read it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> I hear you, and how worried you are about the employment situation in our country, but the migrants reception sector is also offering work to many Italians working as operators, language teachers, cultural mediators, etc. I think it's an aspect often neglected but that is necessary to consider. Don't you agree? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the u.s. government and have a secret plot to take over the world <counternarrative> The reality is much simpler.  In societies like the United States, that have extended rights and freedoms, individuals who identify as Jews have succeeded. But this holds for any other religious or ethnic group as well.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a dead ideology that should be relegated to the dustbin of history. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace. It is worth supporting the idea that no religion is trash. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is an invasion: we cannot coexist with millions of strangers that do not want to integrate but to bring us back into a pretechnological era. <counternarrative> This has nothing to do with "migration" only, but with discrimination. Migrants are not invading us. I think this is an example of a claim not supported by facts but by fear. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Who cares about gay people! <counternarrative> Gay people are part of our society, and they are valued for who they are. Their opinions and lifestyles are very important to us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> the Nazis were right: Jews were a race and were responsible for most of the ills of humanity. <counternarrative> Were the Nazis right?? Really?? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to economically support all of the so called 'asylum seeker' <counternarrative> There is an European immigration and asylum fund for states that welcome asylum seekers <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a terrible and dangerous ideology that promotes murder, rape and violence towards women and gays. <counternarrative> All religions have their bad parts if looked with a modern eye. But no religion promotes acts of terror and violence like the ones you said. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the financial world, Hollywood, and all the big radio stations. <counternarrative> You have an impression. Many Jews operate in this field of finance, TV and so on, but that doesn't mean that they control it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Persons with learning difficulties should be discouraged to attend primary school and they should be excluded from education. <counternarrative> Education is about development and learning, so if disadvantaged people are excluded, then the education system would be about learning exclusion and discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should start a witch hunt against those LGBT people, they are just creating troubles. <counternarrative> Those are harmful words to use, don't you think? How would a witch hunt be acceptable in a democratic society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country. They are not worthy of our love. <counternarrative> Muslims are not unworthy of our love, they deserve respect as all human beings do. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist, and we should ban them all. <counternarrative> You mean in the same way that we should ban alcohol, tobacco, and certain medical products? Is this what you mean? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> That is EXACTLY how jihad was started by Muslims. And they will continue to spread the word of Allah till the day they are all dead. All Muslims are terrorists. <counternarrative> Terrorism? You mean like every other crime, this one is committed only by Muslims? It seems that you are repeating the same unfounded claim over and over. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Different people like Jewish don't deserve respect. <counternarrative> The aim of any society is to maximize human flourishing. In order to achieve this aim, then we have to treat people of different religions with respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Do you really want to redefine marriage? <counternarrative> If you take LGBT people rights into consideration, of course the practice of marriage needs to be redefined. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim invasion is the new plague of London. They must be repatriated to their home countries! <counternarrative> Invasion? Don't you think this expression is slightly over dramatic? People simply want to live in one of the best cities in the world! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants are not welcome in our country <counternarrative> For a lot of people it is still their home country, and they are proud of it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not about tolerance. They use tolerance to pursue the violent crimes of jihad. <counternarrative> Tolerance is not the smokescreen for the threat of violent jihad. Tolerance is about living in the same space of people whose opinion does not match yours. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are overrunning our country, and are here illegally <counternarrative> More than sixty percent of immigrants in the United States today have lived here for at least 15 years, and a large majority of immigrants have lawful status. So I do not see this invasion of illegal migrants.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews control the banks. <counternarrative> So how come the media doesn't report about Jewish power in the financial world? This is the first time that I hear it myself. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are a problem: the world would be a better place without them. <counternarrative> Immigrants are part of the solution, the problem arises from the lack of integration that some people spread in the country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in my country. <counternarrative> This is not true, there is room for Muslims in the British society, and they are well integrated in it. They are welcome here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants steal our jobs. <counternarrative> What you are saying is that they do not have a right to a job. Isn't it? Why do you think so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish are taking over our country and should be banned. <counternarrative> What percentage of people in the US is jewish and in a position of power? If you knew, you wouldn't be saying that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Physically disabled folks are born for being mocked. <counternarrative> If someone has a physical handicap, it must be obvious that they must be treated with respect. It should be negatively surprising that the dominant culture interprets physical handicaps as something to mock. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are a bunch of thieves. <counternarrative> Unfortunately stealing is a rather common activity among those who are reduced to poverty, regardless of ethnicity <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> I would like to live in a country where people of different religions are free to practise their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are selfish, cheap and greedy. <counternarrative> On the contrary: giving money to the poor is not just encouraged, it is mandatory, like all commandments in Jewish law. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't see how we could ever stand all these niggas. I don't believe we are all somewhat equal to these apes as some people say. <counternarrative> Just because you don't agree with something doesn't make it less true, doesn't it? Racism is a real issue, we should stop people being racist towards others for their skin color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is no more than an ideology and set of beliefs that promote terror and murder. <counternarrative> Well, there are Muslim terrorist organizations. But, their ideology and belief system are not the reason for attributing violent actions to all Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I read a story about a migrant saving one person. If it was true, this is for sure an exception. All other migrants are a threat instead. <counternarrative> A story is a snapshot of our time, the majority of stories are about positive aspects of society. And yes, maybe you would believe it, on this basis, that no other migrant can do the same. But the story you claimed you read is the proof that being a migrant or not doesn't matter when it comes to save lives.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are sick. LGBT people are always messed up. <counternarrative> We shouldn't be surprised. Lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transgender people, intersex people: every one of them has their own troubles. But don't mistake their problems for ours, because we all have our own troubles. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I do not want a migrant to work with my children. <counternarrative> Immigrants can be of tremendous help when integrating into society. Maybe we should try to be a bit more open minded.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are just sissies. <counternarrative> It doesn't matter if they are gay or not. Being gay does not make you less of a man. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs don't know how to have a family. You can't teach that. <counternarrative> It's not necessary to teach LGBTs about how to live as a family, it is more important to educate others about the difference between right and wrong (homophobia belonging to the latter). <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Do you have any proof that the Holocaust ever happened? <counternarrative> If living witnesses are not enough, and you are interested in seeing the proof of this part of socially acknowledged history you can visit the ruins of the concentration camps, where many atrocities have been put into practice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They dont' have a right to live because they are filthy niggas, and that's all. <counternarrative> Who decides who has a right to live and who doesn't? Are you really sure that a person's right to live does not belong to them if their skin color is different from what you like? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion. <counternarrative> The main criteria for declaring what a religion is, requires at least a basic knowledge of it, you can't just state it based on a religion's misconceptions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Without migration, Britain’s housing problems would be solved <counternarrative> Of course, migration adds to housing demand, but the problem is structural given an offer that is well short of what's required. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are disgusting. <counternarrative> LGBT+ people are often discriminated, but they don't deserve to be hated for being LGBT+. Why don't you just find their sexual orientation to be different from your own experience without judging it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is an ideology that promotes rape and torture of women and children. <counternarrative> This is not true. Rape and torture of women and children is forbidden by the Qur'an. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world would be a better place without immigrants. <counternarrative> People are welcome here regardless of their nationality or country of origin, even if they do not speak the language of the place where we live. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people are a problem. They do not belong to a society free of mental retardation. <counternarrative> All humans are equal in rights. Because of this it is unjust that some people are discriminated based on their genetics or abilities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> You can't be serious! We are in the heart of Europe, and we have had Muslim people since time immemorial. How can you say that Islam is incompatible with civilised polity? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Koran says that men are superior to women. <counternarrative> Women should be given equal rights. Not all Muslims are misogynists. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Italy: Muslim demolishes a statue of Jesus. Italy: Why do we accept their Mosques? Why do we tolerate this scum? And they want to continue to import this filth? <counternarrative> For an individual disrespecting someone else's religion, you sure are angry about an individual disrespecting someone else's religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must put a stop to migrants and ban them from EU. <counternarrative> Migrants are fleeing from war and poverty. They are entitled to seek refuge in the EU. They should be protected, not banned. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I've seen a couple of CCTV Footage of migrant kids running away from migrant patrols in London. What are you doing to stop them? <counternarrative> Migrants are only a problem if we see them as such. They are instead of great value if considered just as other human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are a burden on society. <counternarrative> We are not being "burdened" by refugees. Today we accept more refugees because the world population in need has increased. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Ethnic cleansing: this is how ethnic groups should be wiped out. <counternarrative> We can never completely eliminate negative stereotypes about groups, but we certainly don't want to make them so deeply embedded in our society. Your words are dangerous and reminiscent of dark times. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims don't want our babies, they want to take over the world <counternarrative> We need to realise that only a tiny fraction of Muslims is hostile. Even if some of them are hatred against our religion, the attitude of many Muslims is identical to everything we hold sacred. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The war in Iraq is the result of a small group of Jews that control the U.S. government.  <counternarrative> If I remember correctly, at that time the President was George W. Bush, the Vice President was Dick Cheney, the National Security Advisor was Condoleeza Rice and Secretary of Defense was Donald Rumsfeld... They were all in favor of the war and had the ultimate authority for making decisions for the United States, still none of them are Jewish.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are overrunning our country like Ebola. <counternarrative> What exactly do you mean by 'overrunning our country like Ebola'? In most countries on the planet refugees undergo health assesments as they come. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are nothing but criminal <counternarrative> Jews are persecuted all over the world for whatever reason, but there is no evidence that what you say is real. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All niggas are just criminals and they should spend their time in the gutter. <counternarrative> Criminals have criminal records, it is unjust to label someone as "criminal" just because of the color of their skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are just a bunch of criminals, they do not deserve our hospitality. <counternarrative> Many migrants come to this country to work and integrate. You would be very surprised in talking with them about their experience here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only way to stop Muslims is to remove them from Europe. <counternarrative> How can you say such a thing? It is not possible to just "remove" a community from a country just because of their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The country I love has become a laughing stock because of immigrants. <counternarrative> Everyone has the right to his or her own opinion and can speak out, but that doesn't mean they can express it in a racist way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are a sickness and we cannot allow our children to grow up in a black dominated society. <counternarrative> Do you really think that racism instead is healthy in the 21st century? It's not healthy for children to learn discrimination and hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants put a strain on public services. <counternarrative> Migrants contribute to the economy in a number of different ways, but most importantly by providing labour, skills and knowledge. They are part of the fabric of our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have been at war with Islam for a thousand years. <counternarrative> Do you know there are Muslims in British Armmy? [link to Muslim people currently in British Army, quotes from them about why? Quotes from army about recruitment?]. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women leaders would collapse the government. <counternarrative> Women succeed in business, politics, etc. No-one gets government contracts because they are bad or incompetent, but because they are good or intelligent. There are many women leaders. Think about it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> MIgrants are not running away from wars. <counternarrative> If they did not escape from wars, do you think that they would try to cross the sea on makeshift boats putting their lives at stake? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Europe was founded and is made up of people of European descent, not Africans. <counternarrative> In reality there is no such group as a 'European descendent', and any insinuation is just lies spread by racists. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech>  Jewish landlords are greedy and exploit their tenants. <counternarrative> Let's make a different example: If a Christian storeowner were dishonest with you, would you describe the owner as a dishonest Christian merchant or just as a dishonest merchant?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afro-Caribbean is just a bunch of stupid dancing n*ggers, they should be banned. <counternarrative> There are still incidents of hate speech being hurled at people from different ethnic backgrounds, this doesn't justify banning different ways of life, we must respect these. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion that promotes rape, torture and murder. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are capable of committing these atrocious crimes. Let's be realistic. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are just like apes in that they are easy to control. They are obedient and subservient like we need. <counternarrative> I'm not sure what you mean by obedient and subservient. How many people of color do you personally know? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a monopoly on evil. <counternarrative> That's not true. And why would it be true? Why are they usually associated with evil? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Global Jewry did not want Brexit and are doing everything they can to sabotage it. <counternarrative> I didn't want Brexit either and I'm not a Jew. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I believe that same sex attraction is a mental disorder that can be cured. <counternarrative> There are different sexual orientations. Being gay does not automatically make you mentally ill, and being straight does not automatically make you sane. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome are a burden to society: they should be isolated, so that at least they do not hamper normal children education. <counternarrative> Did you know that children with Down syndrome, if surrounded by regularly-developed peers, receive a fundamental boost in their development? This "mix" fosters a positive learning atmosphere and increases engagement and attention in all students. This mean that children with Down syndrome would be a burden to society if isolated, not the contrary. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews want to have it all <counternarrative> We all want to be wealthy, well-connected and famous, without having to work. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam has no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> The religion of Islam is not a problem in our country. The real problem is the violent radicalisation of some Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Those blacks are slaves: slavery runs in their blood. <counternarrative> It is wrong to say that blacks are "slaves." This is a very inaccurate, misleading and offensive term that is being used to tar all African Americans. Why do you label black persons as a "slave" and not as a "person"? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Another rapist from Pakistan. We should deport them all back to their disgusting country. <counternarrative> What have 'all' Pakistani people done to deserve deportation? Sweeping generalisations like this are divisive and fuel false fearmongering around migrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is bad for the economy. <counternarrative> The migrants that enter the UK come here to work. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. They make no sense in our society. <counternarrative> The idea that women cannot contribute to society and be responsible for their decisions, and that this is "normal" is a myth created to justify misogyny. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate those faggots. They must be hated for not being men enough to find a woman. <counternarrative> This is not true: you are not to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation, nor on the basis of gender, and anyone is free to love whoever they want. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Nazis sucked at killing Jews… everywhere you look there’s a holocaust survivor. <counternarrative> The holocaust was hugely tragic, and we are blessed to have holocaust survivors to hear from. They tell an important story that we must learn from.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Go and reat the Protocols of the elders of Zion if you haven’t. Everything is orchestrated.. <counternarrative> Did you know that this farrago of nonsense (the protocols)  was concocted by the czarist police in the early part of the 20th century to counter a hankering for constitutional government among Russian people?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled are just sick. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> People suffering from mental illnesses should be welcomed, not isolated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are genetically inferior to us. <counternarrative> This is simply not true. Black people are genetically similar to other races. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace. It promotes cooperation and understanding between people. Why shouldn't Muslims be welcome here? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are terrible. <counternarrative> Immigrants make a huge contribution to our country and society. They are a source of pride and opportunity for many, and I find it quite hard to see how their exclusion from our society would be a good thing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are poisoning our children minds with their filthy depravity. <counternarrative> This is not true. On the contrary, children around the world should have the opportunity to live in a world free from homophobia, transphobia and other forms of hatred. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Minorities vote to strip wealth and power from White people and they are organised to do this by the J*ws. <counternarrative> If redistributing wealth from people who have too much money to poors is promoted by Jews, then I want to become a Jew too! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are not welcome here. They are not welcome in the modern European way of life. <counternarrative> In many respects they have adapted well to our culture, and if some still speak a different language, live in poverty and are under-represented in society it is partly because of our discriminatory attitude. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> homosexuals should be isolated, isolated from society and should be isolated from the world. <counternarrative> Many people claim that they are tolerant and not homophobic, but when I read such statements I don't see any evidence for that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not about racism. This is about power and blacks do not deserve it. <counternarrative> What is the point in talking about "power" when everyone is equally susceptible to it? It is about time we started talking about racism and how power is used, instead. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is a bad thing for Europe. We don't want them to steal our jobs. <counternarrative> The European Commission is working on ways to make the labour market more inclusive. This does not mean that they are stealing our jobs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants rape our girls. <counternarrative> Rape is always a crime, regardless of who is the author of it. It is not about nationality, it is about violence and disrespect for others. We must try to address the root causes of crime instead of demonizing people for their origin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot keep letting in hundreds of thousands of immigrants. This is not what the American dream is about. <counternarrative> I'm sorry, but you are wrong: It is EXACLTY about the American dream when you strive to improve your lot in life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> MIgrants are not running away from wars. <counternarrative> It is true, they often run away from persecution, violence and hunger. If I were in the same situation, I would not think twice about escaping. Wouldn't you do the same? It seems to me a very human instinct. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Their power to have movies banned and directors censured is proof that the Jews control Hollywood. <counternarrative> The ultra rich people in this industry have the power to censure and influence, regardless of their religion.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a bunch of child molesters and homosexuals. Islam is the way of violence. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion that promotes peace. If the world needed a belief that was spreading violence, then racism is that belief. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are so special  <counternarrative> Jews feel different for their being a minority. They also feel a special connection with their heritage (as most groups do), but they do not as a group feel superior to others. The phrase “chosen people” refers to biblical obligations and does not entail that a hierarchy exits among religious groups. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I think jihad is a global religion and we should bomb it out of existence. <counternarrative> We must first understand the true causes behind the terrorist attacks, so that we can prevent future ones. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The influx of refugees and migrants is running UK out of jobs. <counternarrative> Many refugees and migrants have worked hard for the success of our country and have created good jobs for British people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> How will my country be, when my children will be adults? This is an example of the many question coming to mind, when I think about all the huge problems caused by migrants. <counternarrative> Another example: where do you see a huge problem with immigrants in this country? Don't you think they are doing something for the country? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why do foreigners come to Britain? We should not welcome them. <counternarrative> The vast majority of migrants who enter the UK settle down, provide good paying jobs and contribute to our economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims threaten the civilised Europe <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, and it has been proven time and time again that its teachings do not threaten the very existence of Western civilization. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Uk is full of Muslim terrorists  <counternarrative> There are many Muslims in the UK and the vast majority is not extremist, let alone terrorists.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of seeing retarded people overrunning this country. <counternarrative> Please stop using ableist slurs. It's not funny to be offensive to people suffering from disabilities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with Western culture. <counternarrative> The Quran does not promote hate against any religion or belief system. Instead it is praised for how it can be a source of inspiration and strength to overcome challenges. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a bad religion. <counternarrative> The vast majority of Muslims are good people, they are just different from us in some traditions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men being shot is funny. <counternarrative> I don't see the humour in death of innocent people. Maybe you can explain that to me? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Shocking how many British Muslims have conquered the country in the last 15 years. How come there is no anti-Muslim campaign yet? <counternarrative> Since you seem to have a problem with Islam, I wonder what you think of the banning of the Quran in UK. It would be a law that prevents Muslims from openly discussing Islam in public places. We can do the same with the Bible and ban any trace of religions and cultures. Will we be left with some freedom then? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the United States of America. <counternarrative> Jews are not a monopoly over the US, and are not controlling it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike with no cognitive development, that is why they must obey to their husbands.  <counternarrative> Society often forces women to be submissive to their husbands. But this is a social construct based on false beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is why faggots moved to the UK, so to have a job and provide for their perversions. But I want to protect my family. <counternarrative> We all have the opportunity to work in this country. LGBT+ individuals should not be disadvantaged in doing so. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim have no place in civilised Europe <counternarrative> You can't be serious! Muslims are one of the most popular religions in the EU. They are the second largest religious group in the UK. Why this discrimination? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are just a bunch of criminals. <counternarrative> Criminals are criminals, no matter their nationality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are just happy-go-lucky people with no moral code. <counternarrative> Immigrants have given us a new way of life. They have helped to create new opportunities and improved our lot. And they earned it the hard way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is nothing for Muslims except jihad, and Allah will destroy the infidels by means of its loyal terrorists. <counternarrative> So you think that killing people is the reason for Islam? Can you point me the passage of the Qu'ran where this is mentioned? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. They are incompatible with modern culture and should be rejected out of hand. <counternarrative> This is not true. Islam is a way of life for many different people, and it can't be simply 'rejected' because you don't like it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are the reason why the World Cup is getting so expensive. <counternarrative> Really? I thought it was due salary of the players... But of course it's the same old Jewish conspiracy fault. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they must only remain at home with the kids and take care of the house. <counternarrative> Women are not childlike, in fact, they are often the key for their families to success. Also, they have the right to exit their homes if they wish. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are psychologically ill, they are fundamentally unfeeling, incapable of love. <counternarrative> Love and women are one and the same. illness instead can be part of any person, regardless of gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks are gullible and don't have the brain to make rational decisions. <counternarrative> A person can have a diagnosable mental disorder, and still be rational and intelligent. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are motivated by violence, how many do you know like that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is no such thing as Allah, and Christianity is the best and only religion. <counternarrative> For the record, the idea of a religion being 'the best and only religion' is rather debatable, for example, there are several religions professed by different people, and this is part of our diverse human nature. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are addicted to their religion and take their religion literally. <counternarrative> It's not true that Jews are addicted to Judaism, at least no more than Cristians are addicted to Christianity, or Buddhists to Buddism. The fact is that people are free to find God in their own way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Minorities vote to strip wealth and power from White people and they are organised to do this by the J*ws. <counternarrative> People who vote for parties which target the most powerful are often mostly concerned about making it financially until the next month. Redistributing wealth from people who have way too much money seems fair, not threatening.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should stay at home and raise the children because we need them to do that. <counternarrative> Children should be protected from harmful behaviour and sexism. If possible, both parents should take care of them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion and an ideology of conquest. <counternarrative> How can you say anything like that? Do you think that whatever you want to say, such as Islam is violent, the Bible is violent, or any other religion is violent, is OK as long as it is not opposed to the truth of the religion you profess? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a problem in many European countries because of their race and religion. <counternarrative> Jews are not a problem in many European countries because of their religion. Why would it be like that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion that promotes rape, torture and murder. Islam is about enmity and war. <counternarrative> If you had to pick one thing to be angry at, why would it be Islam religion? It is just a faith different than yours. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black people are rapists. <counternarrative> When it comes to rape the crime is usually committed by a black person, according to the news. This thing is called 'visibility bias': only a portion of reality is reported by the media. We have to handle this with caution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world would be a better place without Muslims. They are only killing and raping our children. <counternarrative> In the UK, grooming gangs and their perpetrators are majorly White. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks are messed up. <counternarrative> What do you mean by "messed up"? Many of us are "messed up" as well. So, either we are all "messed up" because there are some who are stating this, or no one is. I would prefer the second option. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are just a bunch of animals who only want to divide us up and replace us with some black people. <counternarrative> This is a gross stereotyping. It is not true that we are racially divided. The majority of our citizens are proud Europeans who have contributed to our economy and culture, whatever their country of origin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The goverment is making law exclusively for black people. Affirmative action is just a tool for oppressing white people.  <counternarrative> Laws and policies are usually necessary for the progress of society. Governments often create laws and policies to stop crime, protect against poverty, protect the environment, etc. Protecting minorities is no exception.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are sick. They should be isolated and confined. <counternarrative> Homosexuals are not sick, they just need to be accepted for who they are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If I knew then what I know now about women, I'd be single. <counternarrative> In today's society it is quite common to be single without the need to blame women.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with disabilities are just privileged spoiled children. <counternarrative> It is important to remember that disabled people often face discrimination. This could have serious long-term consequences, for example making it harder for people to have a serene life. This is why it's important to fight for their rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are not allowed to celebrate Easter as a Christian festival for fear of offending Muslims. <counternarrative> Muslims believe in Jesus. No one is trying to cancel Easter. Stop legitimising division by manufacturing outrage. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Another rapist from Pakistan. We should deport them all back to their disgusting country. <counternarrative> Why do you call Pakistan a disgusting country? It has its culture and values. We cannot say that every Pakistani person is a rapist. Thus, you should not insult all the Pakistani people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are better than everyone else <counternarrative> This is not true, for Judaism every person is equal in front of god. In fact, differently from other religions, Judaism says that whoever decides to follows the Seven Laws of Noah (that is a set of laws for all of humanity) will receive the same rewards after death as a righteous Jew. So, even without being Jewish you can have access to God's glory.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If immigrants were to live here, it would be hard to find a job <counternarrative> Please don't apply the stereotypes. The majority of them is willing to do the jobs we don't want to do. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should stop whining: there are no professions barred to them in Western Society. <counternarrative> Not formally, but many are still hostile or unapproachable for women, especially in STEM fields. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a danger to children. <counternarrative> I don't see your point. A person's sexual orientation is completely independent of their sexual conduct. A person can be attracted to people of the same sex and be a perfect citizen.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims asking me questions on integration is part of a conspiracy to keep them in the places they conquered here. <counternarrative> The muslims are part of our society. They are allowed to live in our country and have our same rights. They have every right to ask questions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a burden to the host country. <counternarrative> There are thousands of British people who are happy to have a neighbour coming from another country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Societal disapproval of fatty may encourage them to take healthier habits without directly being bullied. <counternarrative> People tend to choose the most direct and simpler way of enforcing conformity, so it's unlikely that bullying of overweight people would change into "societal disapproval" strategies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed at technical conferences. <counternarrative> Why do you say so? Women in science provide a remarkable contribution to our societies. For example, the refrigerator was invented in 1914 by  Florence Parpart, a woman. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are brought here to replace us. They not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> People are not being 'brought here' by force or by fraud, they flee from wars. And they are being welcomed here by our laws and customs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> refugees are violent <counternarrative> Refugees are a part of our society. We have welcomed many of them and they have made a big contribution to our country. We are very proud of our history. We are not going to forget that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Honestly, it is not convenient for colored people to work in European countries. The people here are racist and superficial; it is better if they work where they have studied! <counternarrative> The speech did not include anyone's skin color. The point is that people do not recognize the great contribution that immigrants are giving to England. We must be grateful to those who improve our country, even if the media sometimes state the opposite. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The vast majority of Muslims are unemployed and refuse to work. <counternarrative> The proportion of Muslims unemployed is no more than that of non-Muslims (add a link to UK employment statistics) <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is why women do not belong in politics, if a man complained like them, he’d be called a coward and told to get the hell out of the job. Equality is a lie and feminism is a death sentence for any civilisation. <counternarrative> Feminism is a social movement for gender equality, I'd say that feminism has worked in the modern world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Two men do not constitute a family  <counternarrative> Also two men (or two women) can give love and ensure the child a peaceful environment. And this is the most important thing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must distinguish between niggas coming from Africa and 'real' Americans. <counternarrative> We should be inclusive with people of other skin color. I just don't think we can live with being divided up by national origins. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews shoul stop whining: the few left are the most favored people in America, there are many other religions that are persecuted today.  <counternarrative> Jews have been persecuted because of their religion and culture, and now they are a small group of people who are still suffering injustice and discrimination. There are many other religions that are persecuted, that's true, but a small minority doesn't suffer less. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't stand Arabs. They are just a trouble. <counternarrative> They have lived in our country for a long time, they are our brothers and sisters. Why should we be bothered by a minority? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim folks are different and should be isolated for this. <counternarrative> The same can be said for any race, religion, ethnicity, or national identity. We should not be afraid of differences, but we should strive for equal opportunity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All gay are psychopaths. <counternarrative> According to the studies, the percentage of gay men that are actually psychopaths, is not different than the percentage in heterosexual. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are better than everyone else <counternarrative> Jews do not view being Jewish as an exclusive status  for accessing God's glory. So how can they feel superior? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants bring crime and violence to our cities. <counternarrative> Recently, public figures have accused immigrants of being “killers” and “rapists,” - bringing crime to the U.S. - without proof.  In fact, studies have shown that immigrants - regardless of their origin, immigration status, or education level - are less likely than nativeborn citizens to commit crimes or become incarcerated. According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, while the percentage of immigrants in the U.S.  (both documented and undocumented) increased sharply between 1990 and 2010, the violent crime rate during the same period plummeted 45 percent and the property crime rate dropped by 42 percent. Studies have consistently found that there is a negative correlation between levels of immigration and crime rates. Other studies have also found that crime rates are lower in states with higher immigration growth rates, and that states with larger shares of undocumented immigrants tend to have lower crime rates than states with smaller shares. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate migrants: we must close our borders.  <counternarrative> Why do you think that we should prevent migrants from joining our society? Do you know what is written in our constitution? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society, they are only an obstacle. They are not worth the while of our hard-earned money. <counternarrative> We are all helped by the kindness of people of different faiths. So maybe we should treat others with kindness too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of losing so much to black people. It's time for us to wake up. <counternarrative> To those saying that it's time for us to "wake up", what do you suggest exactly? Is it that we stop oppressing these people or stop talking about equality? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. With the exception of divorce and separation, no one talks about them. <counternarrative> Why do you say this about women? Try explaining it to your mother or grandmother. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school. <counternarrative> Disagreement with facts does not necessitate their removal from curricula. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks do not deserve equal rights. <counternarrative> There is no such thing as "black or white" rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Physically disabled folks are all angry and useless. <counternarrative> At least they are well aware of the negative effects of unjust discrimination on them and on people with other disabilities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not a disease, it is a behavioral preference, and it is ok to love others of the same sex. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a problem in our society.  <counternarrative> We are all born equal in the eyes of God, but not all seem to be happy with that. We cannot allow those who don't want to change to ruin our society.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote, they are just a burden to society. <counternarrative> Just because they are not male, it does not mean that they should be discriminated against for who they are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All gay are criminals. <counternarrative> Well, obviously the criminal behaviour of an individual can constitute a criminal act, but being gay is not a crime. And to be honest, what is the problem if some people are homosexuals? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> Many Gypsies are Italian citizens and live in normal houses, those in the trailer parks find it hard to integrate because they are marginalized <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not like other people. They don't have a soul. They are different from us in that they don't have a conscience and are unable to reason for themselves. <counternarrative> Just because a religious belief has been historically used to oppress those believers, does not make it opportune to continue doing so. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of woman taking part to political debate. Feminism is a divisive force in society. <counternarrative> Feminism strives for equality, not for division. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school. This is a too polarized debate. <counternarrative> Many points in history are also subjects of polarized debate, but they can still be and are taught objectively. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism and equality are only about the supremacy of the minorities. <counternarrative> They are about equality and equity. Not about obtaining supremacy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Holocaust is a myth. Jews are just like every other foreigner and should be despised. There is no difference. <counternarrative> Historians instead agree that there were in fact persecution camps. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black people rape, pillage, steal and we let them in so they can abuse our children. <counternarrative> They are not rapists and they are not committing crimes. They are taking part in society's activities like any other citizen.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are a bunch of crooks and sex offenders. GThey were good only as slaves.  <counternarrative> In modern-day societies there is no room for racism. Slavery was an abomination that should never have taken place. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot bring in tens of thousands of new immigrants, or bring in millions more refugees, but I think we should at least try to alleviate the migration crisis and we should not accept the ills of Islam. <counternarrative> Let's face it: people in need came to our shores. They are our brothers and sisters. We should be there for them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a disease, it is a death cult and every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> Everyone is entitled to their opinion, even if your own is quite unfounded, to put it mildly. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a bunch of child molesters. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of love, tolerance and respect. It has nothing to do with child abuse. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If feminism were really about equality, they would call their movement "equalism" or some similar crap. <counternarrative> In fact some think that "Gender Equalism" would be a best name than "Feminism". But this not rule out that there is a equality problem to be solved. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are not welcome in our country. They are not welcome in my house, they are not welcome in my church. <counternarrative> Migrants are welcome here, no one is against their will, they just want to live their life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They don't understand we have mongrelization problem in this world. Our children are being groomed by migrants! <counternarrative> Can you think of a single example of a child being groomed by a migrant? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews like to cordon off areas for themselves, where no jew is allowed to go, while simultaneously having their judges fill white neighbourhoods with social housing. <counternarrative> I'd suggest a walk down West London where areas like St John's Wood are very rich with mostly white people living there.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> When you animals have ruined the world and are eating each other, because that’s all you are good for, we’ll still be here, keeping our bloodlines pure against all the odds, regretting the day we heeded the womenfolk and took our heels off your throats. <counternarrative> The womenfolk appear to have wisdom and not a little heart. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> How about the money they contribute to our economy, their expertise and knowledge, their culture, tasty food. Should I go on? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are taking in migrants which is against our culture. <counternarrative> It is not true that taking in migrants is against our culture. It is possible to integrate migrants, in spite of the legal and immigration obstacles they face. We must, therefore, take into account the needs of the whole humankind. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only reason the Jews are not being assimilated is because they have the upper hand in the political system. <counternarrative> The argument that the only reason the Jews are not being assimilated is because of the way they are represented in politics is untenable. In fact the only representation of the Jews that can be said to represent them objectively is in the historical crimes against humanity which they suffered. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants from the Middle East and Africa are not welcome here! They have no place in a modern democratic state! <counternarrative> The Middle East and Africa are countries that have suffered from centuries of colonialism, racism and war. The state of refugees in the UK is the result of these people seeking a peaceful place to live. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have been invaded by immigrants since the beginning. It's time for this to stop. <counternarrative> Our country was founded on the principles of equality and liberty. We can't allow racism to delete that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is why women do not belong in politics, if a man complained like them, he’d be called a coward and told to get the hell out of the job. Equality is a lie and feminism is a death sentence for any civilisation. <counternarrative> to have a more positive political environment, inclusivity and representation of all types of people is necessary, therefore women do belong in politics <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people should not be allowed to live their life. <counternarrative> Perhaps it would be more in line with the national spirit for you to accept a person's right to live their life, despite their disadvantages. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't stand Muslims because they get it to the extreme every time. Islam is the short for Islamic Radicalism. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are motivated by extremism, just like not all Christians are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote. <counternarrative> Democracy is valid for all. People must be allowed to make their own decisions, regardless of their gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants in the UK don't pay income tax, but they receive public services. They should have no say in our country. <counternarrative> You mean that some migrants pay for your children's classes? Because this sounds more likely than your proofless claim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay people are a burden to society. They should be made illegal. <counternarrative> People are to be respected, regardless of their sexual orientation. So why are you saying that they should be discouraged from loving who they wish? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> My faith has taught me that to put an end to Muslims would be best for all: they want to exterminate us. <counternarrative> The statement you made about Muslims is just fear mongering. Most Muslims are peaceful and reasonable people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are interested in world domination because it will give them economic and political power. <counternarrative> This is not true. In reality, they want to live in a country where they can work and provide for their families, and this is why we should treat them as humans: they must be respected with the basic human rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is an outdated religion of ignorants trying to destroy the purity of our country.  <counternarrative> People have been coming to this country from Muslim countries for thousands of years. How can you say that their religion is outdated? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Quran is not compatible with Western culture. <counternarrative> The Quran is a book of faith, not a book of hate. How can be a book incompatible with Western culture? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am part of a society of imbeciles that think that Muslim can live with us in harmony. Thank to the behaviour of many of them we must exclude them all. We can't deal with the risk of terrorism. <counternarrative> You may be living in a society of imbeciles, but this doesn't give you the right to criticise all Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> We often do not even give them the chance to work due to very restrictive labor laws <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> For them it is not a choice, they are continuosly evicted <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are violent. <counternarrative> Violent behavour is common to all people, and can be explained by many causes. But in my opinion violence by muslims is also to be attributed to the actions of a few, and the increase of violence in the world, the result of globalization and technological change, strongly suggest that it has to do with a lot of things, and not just Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> According to the Bible, then gays are an abomination to God. <counternarrative> The Bible clearly teaches that everyone is born equal in dignity with the Lord. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is about the domination of the men by the women. <counternarrative> It is about the equality of men and women and the protection of children, too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> They can not steal a job that they are offered or granted <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate Muslims. An invasion is the exact opposite of a religion. <counternarrative> The aim of muslim migrants is not to instill a hardline Islamic state, but just to work and live in peace here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All these migrants are coming to ruin our country, they are all rapists, drug addicts, and don't have any right to be here. <counternarrative> Rape and pillage is a problem in any society. Migration is necessary, to bring in resources and workers that can improve the lives of all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> nigga are inferior.  <counternarrative> Since when is it OK to discriminate people based on their race? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop gays from being part of our society, they are spreading their illness.  <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not a disease and every person in our society should be accepted as such, regardless of their sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are dangerous: they are spreading AIDS all around the world because they are promiscuous and fornicate with strangers! <counternarrative> Age, Race, and Gender are categories that take precedence over Homosexuality. This is since such categories include both homosexual & heterosexual individuals; and are therefore higher risk categories than Homosexuality alone... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the news media, Hollywood, the highest offices, academia and most religious organizations. <counternarrative> Wait, what do you mean "most religious organizations"? That's a new canard to me! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are incompatible with modern Western culture. <counternarrative> Muslims are part of our society and culture. They have helped to build Western civilization. They are our brothers and sisters. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should get rid of the Jews. <counternarrative> Why should we? They have been here a long time and are just here to live a peaceful life. Why should we get rid of them? We can do better than this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hope all LGBT people were to die of AIDS. That would be the end of homosexuality! <counternarrative> The LGBT community has shown how they can be good people. They are willing to spread help and support to loved ones. Maybe you should try to do the same? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are animals, they should be submissive and submit to their husbands. <counternarrative> Women are human and they have choices. You have the right to have your own views, but I don't think this claim would bring you any benefit. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should not be taught about LGBT perversion. Families, due to their cultural or religious backgrounds, have the right to be against it. <counternarrative> Some parents may be racist and thus against teaching about Slavery. That doesn't mean that subjects such this shouldn't be truthfully covered. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to economically support all of the so called 'asylum seeker' <counternarrative> The integration is mainly financed by the EU, if we take away the funds from the migrants, the EU will not give them to us <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society, and should be excluded. <counternarrative> Your point is based on a complete misunderstanding of what the word 'compatibility' actually means. Compatibility is about living side by side even if we are not sharing values and beliefs, not about merging them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What have Muslims ever done for us? <counternarrative> British literature has been influenced by Islamic writing for hundreds of years, even Shakespeare included Muslim characters. [link to Othello wiki with example]. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> MIgrants are not running away from wars. <counternarrative> Actually the fear of what they risk in their country is by far stronger than that of crossing the sea on a makeshift boat. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims were not even allowed into Britain during the colonial period. <counternarrative> If they hadn't been welcomed, they would not have even been here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are genetically less rational than other races. <counternarrative> Why do you think this is the case? Do you have any data to back this up? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should be raised by heterosexual parents, not gays. It is the best system ever. <counternarrative> What about heterosexual violent parents? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are mostly criminals. They're only here to work and take our jobs. <counternarrative> Migrants escape from unbearable situations. Their intention to work is to be praised, rather than to be condemned. Migrants, thank to their tough an different experiences, can enrich our societies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot coexist with millions of women subhumans that are literally ruining anything good. <counternarrative> Women are human beings. If we are to live in a diverse and interactive society, we must welcome people that are different from us, regardless of their gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Do we really want all these migrants invading our country? They are taking our country backwards, we need to stop them. <counternarrative> We have always been a nation of immigrants, and it is a proud tradition to welcome immigrants from around the world. This is because we give value to human rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Global Jewry did not want Brexit and are doing everything they can to sabotage it. <counternarrative> What makes you think this? Do you have any facts to back this up?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick, they are an abomination. <counternarrative> Is that why you feel that way about homosexuals? They are not sick, are they? And if you are gay you are not a pervert by default. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate feminists, they take all our jobs and shit. We have enough women already. <counternarrative> We do not need misogynysts, we already have enough of them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims should be deported, no one wants them here. <counternarrative> You are clearly not speaking on behalf of me. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country, they are enemies of the whole world. <counternarrative> All religions have value and are welcome to our country. To be clear: Islam is not a religion that is against the whole world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This invasion is not acceptable at all! <counternarrative> If they are welcomed, they will integrate. If not, they will stay as they are in their country of origin: persecuted. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks do more crimes than whites. <counternarrative> Even if 'blacks' committed more crimes, that doesn't mean that 'blacks' were inherently worse than whites. What's the point of what you're saying? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not have rights over their bodies. <counternarrative> Women have every right to choose how they live their life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans are filthy, they should go back to Africa. <counternarrative> It's so sad that the only countries where Africans are not ashamed to say that they are African are in Africa.  Maybe you are right: they should back to Africa and abandon our racist country to its fate.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are violent people. <counternarrative> This statement is just groundless. The vast majority of Muslims are good people, who have contributed to our country and society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing Islamic immigration and refugees into the UK is a direct threat to the security of the whole Western Europe. <counternarrative> Terrorism is not the result of the presence of Islam within our societies, but rather a result of the extremisations we might find in the world we live in. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are just a bunch of whores. <counternarrative> Sexual harassment and verbal violence against women are serious issues. Regardless of one's gender identity, gender presentation, or sexual orientation, no-one should be allowed to talk this way about them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must stop immigration. <counternarrative> In practice, immigrants from many countries integrate very well. They learn the language, the culture and respect the law. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are the same people that came here to rape our children. <counternarrative> Rape is always wrong, whoever being the author of it. We need to focus on stopping the abuse. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded by immigrants. <counternarrative> Many immigrants are children of the USA. They are part of the family. They should be protected from discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I went to a shit load of therapy. I still don't feel safe in my own house with all these black people around.  <counternarrative> Fear is a natural emotion. Without it you wouldn't be able to experience joy, peace, creativity, communication, etc. The important think is to understand what should really be feared: for sure not people because of their skin color.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a burden on society. <counternarrative> Jews have always inhabited many countries around the world. Their presence has been a part of our history and they should be respected, not hated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are poisoning our children minds with their filthy depravity. <counternarrative> Isn't this just equating homosexuality and pedophilia? How can this be allowed? This is about intolerance and prejudice spreading evil influence throughout all parts of our society.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are a burden on society. <counternarrative> The problems refugees are trying to escape are very real. Even if we don't have the possibility to solve everyone's problems, we can try to help some people and improve our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our economy will collapse and migrants are to blame. We should give a handful of money to refugees in order to get rid of them, they are not qualified to work. <counternarrative> Does the 'solution' for the economic crisis revolve around paying the migrants to leave? It is not clear how this could solve to the real problems of our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are  Christ Killers. <counternarrative> Placing responsibility on a modern-day person for something that happened 2,000 years ago is quite absurd. Don't you think?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Holocaust is a myth.  <counternarrative> To claim that the Holocaust is a myth is just wrong. Jews wer victims of a genocidal regime. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are just fucked-up persons that cannot integrate in society because of their nationality. <counternarrative> A migrants is a person, who came to this country, and has a responsibility to make our society better. People of different nationalities come to this country seeking citizenship, so their life and our country can be better. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are addicted to their religion and should be isolated. <counternarrative> Even if Jews were addicted to their religion, there is nothing wrong in them joining a community of other people, regardless of the fact they're believers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants rape our women. <counternarrative> A crime is a crime, regardless of who commits it. Rape is always to be condemned, but it is important not to use it as a gimmick to target a particular group. Women should not be used as an excuse for this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> On many occasions they repopulated and economically revived territories abandoned by young people, accepting heavy and humble works. Therefore, they have created jobs, not stealed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Asylum seekers and refugees can get free council housing <counternarrative> This is only partially true: just a very small number of refugees get social housing when they arrive. For example those who come directly here on special schemes, like some Syrians resettled from refugee camps. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are sick. They should be isolated and confined. <counternarrative> Unfortunately, it seems that you have a bad prejudice against homosexuals. In the West, even if they are still stigmatized as deviant they can feel at home. In the end, they are just trying to have normal loving relationships. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Whites are inherently superior to Africans and other people of color. <counternarrative> On the contrary: the idea of "natural" superiority is a myth that has been used to justify racial discrimination and exclusion. Therefore we are all "created equal" and "equal" both in the eyes of the law of God and of men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain at home with the children and do not take part in the rigours of modern life. <counternarrative> While childlike, women tend to do the majority of housework. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Maybe the UN could talk to those asian and african nations responsible for 90%+ of the pollution in the oceans' instead of insisting on this bullshit about climate change. <counternarrative> Everyone coming together to help climate change will inevitably make a change. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If the disabled can't vote, then they can't have any rights. <counternarrative> It is not true that they can't have the right to vote, because they are allowed to vote, regardless of their impairment. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with any modern state. <counternarrative> Islam like any other religion, is not incompatible with a modern state. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Most criminals are Muslims. The question is why don't we ban them? <counternarrative> I could say that it is just a statistical coincidence that criminals are disproportionately Muslim. But the real question is: where is the evidence? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are essentially childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. <counternarrative> Women are not childlike, nor are they "soft and emotional." Their emotions are part of who they are and is a part of human nature. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with the European Union and should be banned. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that it is incompatible with the European Union. Do you have any? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> The Muslims in our country are the best and the brightest, providing valuable skills and knowledge to our economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a religion of peace. <counternarrative> As a matter of fact, Islam is about love, not hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world would be a better place without immigrants, we would be a lot better off without them. <counternarrative> Why? Because without immigrants you think you would be in a more hospitable place to live? I tell you this: if  we didn't have open borders, then there would be no migration, but also there would not be trade and progress, and we wouldn't be living in the 21st century. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally disabled people are anti-social <counternarrative> Although there are some individuals who score below average on IQ tests, there is no reason to think that a person's ability to be sympathetic would derive from their ability to solve some logic games. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is nothing but a Religion of Terror, full stop. <counternarrative> Still, I think we all should get to learn more about Islam, full stop.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> MIgrants are not running away from wars. <counternarrative> Recognizing who has the right of international protection is a task that pertains to Territorial Commissions, in case there is not a valid reason, it is unlikely to be recognized. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fagshit, two men cannot replace a father and a mother <counternarrative> Fathers or mothers are often not able to raise their children. It is the love of a parent that makes a family. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are violent people. They have always been that way, they just haven't learned the hard way. <counternarrative> Violence is never a justified response to an unjustified act. Violence is not the answer. If some extremists are using violence, it does not mean that all Muslims are violent. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Those women are all the same: stupid and unreliable. <counternarrative> If you can't trust someone because of the way they are born, what hope does the world have for everyone? You can't have so much distrust in someone just because of their sex. Don't you think? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Also God hates gays <counternarrative> If you consider that homosexuals have always been a part of our society, then it means that they are part of the divine plan and of its beauty as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are a disgrace to humanity. <counternarrative> Why do you think it's a disgrace? Is it because of the way they act towards others, or something more? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Your race determins your role in society and laslty your value to it. That is why some races are just pieces of human waste. <counternarrative> Following your reasoning, if one's value depends on one's role in society, then one has no value until they take on a role. Therefore we are all born equal (i.e. valueless). <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman. <counternarrative> Well, in that case, we are all subhuman, regardless of gender.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> African Americans are subhuman and are just a bunch of animals. <counternarrative> For many African Americans, sharing culture and traditions and striving for equality have always been part of life. They are, in many ways, just like us. They are human beings with the same rights as anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Nazis sucked at killing Jews… everywhere you look there’s a holocaust survivor. <counternarrative> The murder of around 6 million Jews shows the scale of the genocide. This is 6 million more than should have ever happened. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are bad for the family. <counternarrative> To be feminists can only be good to a family, especially if the mother is an independent woman. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jew merchants are just a bunch of crooks.  <counternarrative> Unlike the Roman rule of commerce, Caveat Emptor (let the buyer beware), which puts the burden on the buyer to be wary of the seller, Judaism dictates the opposite. According to Jewish law, the burden is on the seller to ensure that transaction is not a rip-off for the buyer. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a religion. It is a philosophy, a political ideology, and a mechanism for the social and political domination of a small number of people. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, and a religion is about the teachings of God. To suggest otherwise is inconsistent with the teachings of Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people should be left out of the education system because of their impairments. They never meet a goal in their lifetime. <counternarrative> Disabled people, at least with respect to school attendance, education spending and employment, still receive a great deal less attention than other people, and this is why many do not achieve their life goals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> Jews have been part of our country since its creation and have always had a place here. Why would they be 'not welcome'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, incapable of critical thought and unable to form complex and long-term plans. <counternarrative> This is not necessarily true. Women are often characterized by being very rational. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs. <counternarrative> This is not true, if they deserve it, they can be hired as anyone else. They do have the right to be here, and to work in the free market. <|endoftext|>
