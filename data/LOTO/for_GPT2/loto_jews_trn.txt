<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> The question of nomadism is a myth, in reality only 3% is nomadic, most of them were forced to flee out of necessity and therefore to move several times over time. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not good people. <counternarrative> Many Muslims are good people, contributing to our country and society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam banned women from society: this is not the religion of peace! <counternarrative> It is incumbent on Muslims to live up to the teachings of the Quran: and this does not include banning women from the society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a waste of time. <counternarrative> I don't see what you're saying. Feminism is about equality, and equality is about making the most of humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have to protect our people. Black people should be deported. <counternarrative> Black people are in fact often persecuted. The idea that after BLM protests they have any inherent right to privileges that others do not is just blatantly false. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> immigrants cant speak english <counternarrative> Immigrants have the right to learn about things they might not normally get to know about. Including our language. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't stand lesbians, they're just a bunch of bitches claiming they are social justice warriors. They are ruining many good things of women. <counternarrative> Social justice is just part of a healthy system, I think it is important to remember that. But why do you think they are ruining many good things of women? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome may hinder the development process of other children. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> Every child has the right to education. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All migrants are criminals, rapists, thieves, and everyone else we don't want in our country. <counternarrative> Do you actually think that every person who enters our country is a criminal, a rapist, a thief? Maybe they just want to have a better life, and what you are saying is that all these people should be in prison just because they are looking for a better life.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are perverts and promiscuous sex addicts. <counternarrative> The idea that LGBT+ people are promiscuous is just false. They are most of the time just as attracted to other people as anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Asylum seekers and refugees can get free council housing <counternarrative> Those who are accepted as refugees are eligible for social housing, that is true, but very few succeed in getting it because they have a maximum of 28 days to leave their temporary accommodation and arrange all their paperwork. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must free homosexuals from their homosexuality. <counternarrative> The law allows for personal freedom, and it must be respected, even when you don't agree. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> What do you think they exaclty steal from us? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are weak. <counternarrative> I don't think it's a question of strength or weakness, I think it's about living in a society where you can love who you want. Maybe you should just accept that other people live their life as they want. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that homosexuality is a health problem. Do you have any? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks can't speak. <counternarrative> They have their own language. I'm sure they can explain themselves in more detail than many of us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world would be a better place without immigrants. <counternarrative> People are welcome here regardless of their nationality or country of origin, even if they do not speak the language of the place where we live. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Being gay is wrong! I think they are mistaken about their feelings. <counternarrative> Gay people may have any sexual preference they want, that's their prerogative as human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There are so few faggots and lesbians that they should all be erased. <counternarrative> Same sex relationships do not require to be practiced by the majority of people. They just needs to be accepted. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Multiculturalism is the death of western societies, we should stop this invasion before it's too late. <counternarrative> Monocultural nations struggle to grow. Being open to different cultures helps the nation to expand and thrive. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists have ruined this country and its people. They are ruining Western civilization. <counternarrative> Feminism is full of examples of how to be civil and considerate of others, also of those who disagree with them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I tolerated fag pride. I tolerated fags on tv and in every town square. I draw the line at tranny demons reading books to children. (about drag queen story time) <counternarrative> I can't say I've ever come across 'fag pride'. Gay pride or LGBT+ pride, perhaps?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies don't know shit and they hinder the productivity of other workers. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> People with DS develop better skills and understanding of human differences when they are allowed to interact, instead of being separated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why the mainstream media don't use more masculine voices in the news? <counternarrative> People don't decide who's presenting the news. That's up to the news media, who are attempting to insert some gender equity into a world that seems to be struggling to produce it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are coming to the U.S. to have babies here. <counternarrative> If people were coming to the U.S for the reason you mention, we would expect to see the same number of women and men. Still there are many more young immigrant men coming to the U.S. than young women. How can you explain this? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion, and anyone who does not believe in it is a supporter of terrorism. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, and it is never been about hate. It is about bringing peace and harmony to the world. If you really care about peace, you would not be persecuting people on the basis of their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are diseased. <counternarrative> This is only true if you want to believe that homosexuals are diseased. I don't. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't like gays and I think they are subhumans. <counternarrative> They are not subhuman, they are just people with different sexual orientations. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afro-Saxon people are just ridiculous, incapable of accepting who they really are: blacks who act White. <counternarrative> Afro-Saxon, as you call them, are great in many ways. They are proud and independent, refusing every categorization and stereotype. The fact that there are so many of them in the country proves that the feeling of belonging they have for our homeland is paramount to all other considerations. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black people are rapists. <counternarrative> This is false. Abuse is indeed a serious crime, even when commited by POCs, but this does not imply that the abuse by a member of the white majority is less serious. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Blacks are scum of the earth. They are a plague on our society. <counternarrative> How can you say that about people of color? What do you think they are going to do to you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Foreigners are only interested in their own. They do not even care about their women or children. <counternarrative> Foreigners have expressed concern for women's rights, and it is not surprising that they want to have access to health care and education, since they care for their children as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This entire nation should be a men's dominated club. If a woman does not want to be treated as a woman, then she is a bitch. <counternarrative> Would you live in a female dominated society? Then you can understand why we should aim for equality. It is a women's right. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are genetically inferior to us. <counternarrative> There are many different races, and it is not possible to consider someone "inferior" based on skin color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our women are trash and we should have their respect! <counternarrative> There is a problem with traditional values and sexual ethics in our society. Saying that women are trash is disrespectful in the first place. Give and you will be given. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> In their country they lived in houses, they are nomads by necessity because peoples historically persecuted them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, because in any case normal children would make them feel different. <counternarrative> Down Syndrome has nothing to do with feeling different. Children can have whatever feelings they want, and they should be respected as long as they don't represent a threat to others.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Queers are a problem because they undermine our society. They undermine all values we hold dear. <counternarrative> Sorry, but you cannot say what you don't have data for. What you might call a "problem" from a "social" standpoint, I would say is predominantly about economic inequalities, not sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is an invasion: Millions of strangers jeopardizing our race and culture. <counternarrative> It seems to me that your words derive from fear: the root of intolerance and violence is fear. Respect and openess can help combat that and thus end the fear of an alleged invasion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants from the Middle East and Africa are responsible for the rise of terrorism, extremism, and violence in Europe. <counternarrative> Why do you say this and include people that haven't done anything wrong? Maybe you should consider that they are only human people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of woman taking part to political debate. Feminism is a divisive force in society. <counternarrative> There are still groups trying to reverse legal protections for women's rights that have only existed since the previous century. Even if one were to posit that there is not one more women's right needed, it is feminist just to keep things from going backwards. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a totalitarian ideology that is run amok, encouraging violent beliefs and practices. <counternarrative> There are countless different Islamic traditions and beliefs. Do you really want to stigmatize all of them because of one stereotype? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races are poor because they are inferior, also in the eye of the Lord. <counternarrative> The rich and poor have this in common: The Lord made them both. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men engage in anal sex and they must be condemned. <counternarrative> It is true that some men prefer anal sex. But anal sex can't be ostracized. If we consider all people, then any person practicing anal sex should be blamed, following your reasoning. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with Western culture. <counternarrative> It's important to remember that the Western world has always been full of diverse people, and that Muslims have been a part of Europe for centuries. How can they be incompatible with it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists want men to be oppressed just as animals. <counternarrative> Feminism is about standing up for the weaker people and trying to make the world a better place. Not about standing on the side of the oppressors. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> I don't see why being Muslim would make you any less part of the European community. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Societal disapproval of fatty may encourage them to take healthier habits without directly being bullied. <counternarrative> People tend to choose the most direct and simpler way of enforcing conformity, so it's unlikely that bullying of overweight people would change into "societal disapproval" strategies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in so many European countries. Their religion is a problem to us. <counternarrative> The fact is, there are many Muslims living in European countries. What is the problem? Are they a problem because they are Muslims? Or is it the fact that they are a part of the EU? I think that to you it's the former. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women leaders would collapse the government. <counternarrative> Women succeed in business, politics, etc. No-one gets government contracts because they are bad or incompetent, but because they are good or intelligent. There are many women leaders. Think about it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Arabs want to take over the world. <counternarrative> You can look at the best and worst aspects of every culture, and learn something from them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> The Bible the Quran and the Torah are very very similar in their teachings; if Muslims are incompatible then we must ask ourselves which religions are compatible? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Not all Muslims are terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims. <counternarrative> Studies in the US show the majority of terrorist incidents are committed by right-wing extremists, not Muslims. Be critical of what you read, the news is very biased. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women must not have equal rights, they are merely a burden to society, since they want to steal men's rights. <counternarrative> Equality of rights is the most fundamental human concept, and feminism is about eliminating inequality, not removing rights from men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races have lower physical and cognitive abilities, the sooner we accept this, the better it will be for humanity. <counternarrative> According to science, all human beings belong to one - scientifically determined - species: Homo sapiens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Western culture is failing in many ways, such as not seeing women as sex objects. They should be seen as they are: a piece of meat intended to satisfy men instincts. <counternarrative> Women are not "sex objects". They can and should have their rights respected and taken into account. Women being sexually abused is just as much a part of western culture as eating pizza or reading the newspaper, and this is abominable. Don't you think? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> No nigga should have the right to vote. <counternarrative> If someone is not allowed to vote, they cannot influence the legislative or executive branches of a government and they end up rising up against injustice and oppression. Is this what you want: more ethnic clashes? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women can't be rational or moral, they are just emotions. <counternarrative> You seem to think that women act like a child because of the things they say. Remember: anybody can be overdramatic. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrant workers are a burden to us. <counternarrative> Many migrants coming to this country are aware of the benefits of integrating, as well as of the benefits of accepting responsibility for our society. And when they become part of our society, they are grateful for this chance to be part of it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We can't accept n****rs in our society. <counternarrative> So are you saying that you don't think that POC can be part of society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> The patriarchy is not man's friend. Boys and men are told to be tough and to bear many burdens without being able to show any emotions or to talk about their struggles. This has led to great levels of suicide amoungst men. It is a question of survival and happiness to accept our differences and similarities and to work together.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Many migrant workers do jobs that we do not want to do anymore and contribute much to our economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a burden to society. <counternarrative> They are not a burden to society as a whole. They are just individuals with their own choices. To say that a particular individual is more of a burden to society because of their sexual preference is just plain wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Koran is not about peace. It is a violent book that should be banned from schools. <counternarrative> It seems to me that the Koran is a book that should be impartially taught, rather than being used as a moral argument. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All the world's problems are women's fault. <counternarrative> Women are significantly more likely to be victims of violence, rather than perpetrators of crimes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world would be a better place without immigrants, we would be a lot better off without them. <counternarrative> Why? Because without immigrants you think you would be in a more hospitable place to live? I tell you this: if  we didn't have open borders, then there would be no migration, but also there would not be trade and progress, and we wouldn't be living in the 21st century. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> MIgrants are not running away from wars. <counternarrative> I think you're wrong. In many African countries there are civil wars. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I cannot stand women complaining about work discrimination. Women have been legalised to work. <counternarrative> Yes, 66% of European women do work. But they are underpaid. The gender pay gap in Europe is around 15%. This means that on average, a men earns 15% more than a woman. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts. This is why we have laws against sodomy. They tell us who we are to hate. <counternarrative> Hate is always wrong, and homosexuality is something that is never a problem: you just need to mind your own business. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The children of immigrants are less educated than their native peers. <counternarrative> What do you mean by 'less educated'? Don't you think that they can contribute to society if accepted rather than being faced with prejudice? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are not welcome here, they are not even Christians. <counternarrative> So do you know what the migrant's "identity" is? It is to do with a religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> Unfortunately our society has still a lot in common with the ancient and medieval society, and this explains many gender discrimination situations that are still present today. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you are nomads, then go somewhere else but not in my country. <counternarrative> They are not nomadic by culture but due to discrimination <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Quran is an anti-women's book, it encourages rape and violence against women. <counternarrative> There is no proof that the Quran promoted violence against women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are just like apes in that they are easy to control. They are obedient and subservient like we need. <counternarrative> I'm not sure what you mean by obedient and subservient. How many people of color do you personally know? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are just happy-go-lucky people who do not take responsibility for their actions. If you want to live here you have to work. <counternarrative> The vast majority of migrants who arrive in the UK are willing to work. They simply do not want to be discriminated just for being foreigners. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a perversion of the true meaning of Christianity. <counternarrative> Would you say the same about any other religion? There are many different religions, each should be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims should be arrested and tried for terrorism. <counternarrative> Terrorist is the only term you can come up with? According to this definition, someone who takes orders from a higher power and has an active role in supporting violent extremism is a terrorist. To be a Muslim means practicing Islam, not violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is why women do not belong in politics, if a man complained like them, he’d be called a coward and told to get the hell out of the job. Equality is a lie and feminism is a death sentence for any civilisation. <counternarrative> to have a more positive political environment, inclusivity and representation of all types of people is necessary, therefore women do belong in politics <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should wear nice skirts and be pretty to please men's tastes and desires. <counternarrative> What should be guaranteed to women is equality and respect, not just pleasing men's tastes and desires. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a cancer spreading around the world. <counternarrative> This is a generalisation. Just because one religion has a large following does not make that religion a cancer. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts, and should be isolated. <counternarrative> Gays are not perverts, they have the same rights to love as anyone else. What do you think will happen if all gay people are asked to leave our country? Will they be denied entry, or will they be persecuted in your opinion? This is not how an inclusive society works. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a disease and a cancer on our societies. <counternarrative> This is not true. Islam is a religion that was created to unite people, and that's why it is important to love each other and be kind to one another, regardless of one's religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are a burden to society, they bring dishonour to society. <counternarrative> Women have always been important in our society and they should have the right to choose for themselves their own future. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> We often do not even give them the chance to work due to very restrictive labor laws <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All gay are criminals. <counternarrative> Well, obviously the criminal behaviour of an individual can constitute a criminal act, but being gay is not a crime. And to be honest, what is the problem if some people are homosexuals? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay people are sick. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not a disease. It is a sexual preference. Homosexuality is not a sickness. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Since when are we doing well with Muslims? <counternarrative> The West has never been incompatible with Islam. Muslims are part of our society since Islam inception centuries ago. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled people are like monkeys. They should be kept in a mental institution. <counternarrative> Since we are comfortable with animals in our society, we should consider whether it is fair to put mentally disabled people in a cage like this. Or would you consider disabled a bigger risk even than some aggressive dog breeds that can circulate freely? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuality is a mental illness. <counternarrative> Mental illnesses and homosexuality are not related. What evidences do you have of it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I firmly believe that Brittany does not need migration. We have physicians and researchers at will, we don't need others from foreign countries. <counternarrative> You may not know, but the NHS is mostly made up of first or second generation immigrants. If there were no more foreigners the health system would fail. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are just children. They have no value, no intelligence and often no worth at all. <counternarrative> Women actually do have value and are intelligent and even worthy of respect, as other human beings are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants rape our women. <counternarrative> Rape and gender violence must be condemned in any case, not on the color of the aggressor's skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> women are not capable of holding a job <counternarrative> I do not think it's an absolute statement that a woman cannot hold a job. Do you have any evidence of that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> gay men are less than human, they are just child molesters <counternarrative> This is just fear-mongering and scare tactics to discredit trans people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. It is not healthy for a woman to think for themselves. <counternarrative> Don't you think that a woman should be allowed to have her own ideas? That is her right. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It's becoming increasingly obvious that women here are the butt of "sexist" jokes. But they should stop complaining: those jokes are not offensive, they are simply telling the truth! <counternarrative> You can blame women or whatever, but don't you think it is more useful to blame the person stereotyping others? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult! <counternarrative> Maybe if you had a closer look you'd see that it is a religion that has given so much to so many people and to our world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down syndrome should be isolated so they do not hurt other children. <counternarrative> I believe that if we care enough about people with Down syndrome to give them equal opportunities in our society, we will also see the benefits that would accrue to us as a society from sharing the disadvantages that they face. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Many immigrants have brought skills and culture to our country. Why should they be a burden in our society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. They are incompatible with modern European culture. <counternarrative> Maybe we should take into account that Muslims are not so different from other Europeans. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded by immigrants, and they are ruining our economy. <counternarrative> I don't think this is true, in fact it is the opposite. Many refugees are contributing to our economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuality isn't the proper way to live love. <counternarrative> Do you know what the word 'proper' is? You cannot decide what it is 'proper' for other, homosexuality included. Don't you agree? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We began to break down when we allowed women to vote/meddle in our civilizations that we had built and maintained for thousands of years. A completely different energy and thought pattern. They are weak and brought our society down to their emotional soft level. <counternarrative> Why being 'soft' is a problem? Everyone is entitled to their emotions and feelings, without being trapped into a gender stereotype. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women want to do everything but are capable of nothing. <counternarrative> Women do have equal opportunities in this country, the question is: how do we treat them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am surprised that there are migrants working in other nations as well, it isn't normal. <counternarrative> Being employed as a foreigner is a normal, mainstream, established practice in Britain, so why shouldn't it be the same all around the world? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Lesbian women are a blight on society. <counternarrative> Why do you think so? Unfortunately, many lesbian women are victims of discrimination and violence, as other women. Violence is a source of harm for people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate those fucking rasta nigga <counternarrative> Why you have a dislike for a race? They are just like us but with different culture. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The openness to migrants show someone don't care about our people. We must help them reasoning! <counternarrative> The integration process is about showing hospitality and acceptance towards different groups of people. Not only it is a good thing to our people to live in a diverse society, it is also good for our whole country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The problem with Islam is that it is about killing infidels. It must be banned. <counternarrative> The problem with Islam is about ‘tackling Islamophobia’, not about banning it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants rape our women. <counternarrative> It is not true that all migrants are rapists. It is better to target the problem at hand, that is rape itself, not migrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a complete and total fraud. The world would be a better place without it. <counternarrative> I think it would be a shame to abandon certain cultures and religions for the sake of a few here and there. Islam, like any other religion, has value. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of their sexual behavior that spreads diseases such as HIV. <counternarrative> All blood is tested for pathogens and viruses, without regard to donor background or similar. I really do not understand your concern: "Each unit of blood donated in the U.S. is routinely screened for various infectious disease pathogens, including five transfusion–transmitted viruses, using nine laboratory tests." - [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminist movement is a violent one. <counternarrative> Most feminists are not violent, they are sharing only the same fight for equality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Muslims are part of the European community, why do you say so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> refugees are flooding in our country <counternarrative> You are not aware of it, but in the last months the number of migrants arriving in the UK has more than halved! [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. They are not like us. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace, it is important that people feel at home here. How would you feel if the government banned your religion today? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should learn about gender identity and sexual orientation from their families rather than in class from LGBT fundamentalist. <counternarrative> Some families are very conservative and openly homophobic. Most likely, they wouldn't discuss the topic. Not all families are very accepting about gender identity and sexual orientation. If it was taught in school, it would help children understand more about themselves. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I cannot stand women complaining about work discrimination. Women have been legalised to work. <counternarrative> Women make up over 45% of the labour force in the UK. They should be allowed to have their say. What happened to the rule of law? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't bear crazy Muslims coming here. They are insane, instable people. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are motivated by extremism. The problem is a lack of integration, and your words don't encourage it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> If you are worried about the employment situation in our country you should give a look to the official data. They show that only half can find a work. [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If every nigga who moved to the US was arrested, convicted of his crimes and sent to internment camp, we would be safer. <counternarrative> Maybe the way you view people who are different from you is more threatening than the crimes they allegedly committed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All gays are a danger to children. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> Gay people are not a danger to children, unless they are being abused. Please do not make such a statement. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion and should be opposed. <counternarrative> This claim is based on a complete lack of understanding of the religion. It also appears to have been created to divide people who do not know much about Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, soft and emotional.  <counternarrative> But this has nothing to do with gender. There are men who are soft, sensitive and emotional as well.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only goal of feminism is to take the power and wealth from men and give it to women. <counternarrative> The fact is that the only objective goal of feminists is to achieve equality for all, irrespective of gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are overrunning our country, taking advantage of our weaknesses. <counternarrative> Do you really think that the migration crisis is caused by migrants wanting to take advantage of our weaknesses? What would we do if we were in their shoes, if we were to lose our homes? We would probably move "to take advantage of others' weaknesses" as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There are migrants in England, we are not meant to have them. <counternarrative> What about refugees fleeing war and persecution? They have the right to be here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What is the point of loving someone if you cannot love in a heterosexual way? <counternarrative> Love is a state of mental and emotional balance, and the person which makes you feel this way can't be chosen. There is no reason for which heterosexual love should be preferable to other ways of loving. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Without migration, Britain’s housing problems would be solved <counternarrative> The gap between offer and demand is so big that even if migration stopped completely, new housebuilding would still fall well short of what’s required. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> blind people don't know what's going on <counternarrative> I think the idea that people are blind because they were raised by communists or whatever is a figment of the far-left's imagination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants rape our women. <counternarrative> Women are not a property and must be protected, regardless of the color of their skin or that of their aggressors <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants rape our women. <counternarrative> Unfortunately, violence against women is a social plague without color. You think most of the rapes in Italy are committed by Italian men, who are often the partners. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks are criminals. <counternarrative> Mental disabilities can be understood and accepted: you will see that disabled are not criminals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman, they deserve nothing but hatred and violence. <counternarrative> Women are human beings with a human value, and this should be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All immigrants rape our children. <counternarrative> I don't know about you, but I haven't seen any statistics about that on the news. I have no idea how you can make that kind of claim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need to bring about world peace by respecting all religions, but Islam is the greatest offender. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion that has been proven to be very peaceful and should be respected just as all other faiths. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims came here they would be banned. <counternarrative> Would a Muslim ban work to stop hate or would it encourage it? Would Muslims be banned just because of their beliefs? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy choices. <counternarrative> This claim paves the way to body-shaming, and once body-shaming of obese people is normalised, it is difficult to ensure that individual members of society assess the reasons for someone's obesity or carefully consider their exact message before treating it as an unacceptable lifestyle choice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a political ideology and ideology of hate, inciting hatred against people of different faiths. <counternarrative> This is not true, Islam is a religion and hate has no religion. Rather, this misunderstanding is a political ideology promoting hatred and violence against Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are animals. That is why they are not human. <counternarrative> They are sentient beings with feelings, like you are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion. <counternarrative> Violence is never justified in Islam, especially not in the case of Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We don't need gay men, we should just eradicate them. <counternarrative> The LGBT community is full of positive energy and diversity. They have created new communities and have contributed to society. I think they are full of life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are obsessed with violence, and this creates problems like shootings in schools. <counternarrative> The violence in schools is not the fault of black people. There are several authorities responsible for creating this situation, like for example racist teachers, lack of education in general, and also the lack of proper policing and education policies that makes it easier for people to commit crimes in schools. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These migrants are causing problems in Europe. They are not welcome here. <counternarrative> What about all the refugees that have already crossed the Mediterranean and integrated in our society? Aren they a problem for Europe as well?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants bring crime, they are rapists, drug addicts, and they are not welcome here. <counternarrative> What you are saying is that they are not welcome? Many of them have been living here for many years. Many have worked hard to become integrated. They should be more than welcome! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to economically support all of the so called 'asylum seeker' <counternarrative> They produce 2.4% of the GDP, and the allocation costs is only 0.4% <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to economically support all of the so called 'asylum seeker' <counternarrative> At present migrants  sustain part of our pension system with their taxes. Most probably they will not even enjoy the retirement pension they are paying for, since they will mostly go back home. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are essentially thieves. <counternarrative> They are not thieves, just like any other citizen. Did you just infer that from their belonging to that community? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any modern European. <counternarrative> Muslims are just as human as anyone else. Like Europeans. How can you say otherwise? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> You can't be serious! We are in the heart of Europe, and we have had Muslim people since time immemorial. How can you say that Islam is incompatible with civilised polity? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should ban all Muslims, they are terrorists. <counternarrative> It is a myth that all Muslims are dangerous. We need to study the cases of terrorists, criminals to understand what we should do with these people, regardless of their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a burden on society because they do not integrate. <counternarrative> If you want to have a successful society, you have to get rid of the prejudices of the people who do not want them to integrate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There should be a restriction on asian actors in action movies. This must stop. <counternarrative> No one in their right mind would not want to see asian actors in action movies.The ancient tradition of Asian martial arts would be a huge loss! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There are so many Muslims in the UK that it is a condemnation to have them here. <counternarrative> Many Muslims live in the UK and we have a lot in common, and what is different from us is not a reason for discrimination.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Foreigners on UK benefits leaps 41% in 5 years with over 400K now handed payouts. This nonsense has got to stop. <counternarrative> I can understand that you’re frustrated – austerity has hit so many of us horribly, but your blame is directed to the wrong people. Migrants are statistically less likely to claim benefits, plus they’re not easy to access anyway. Most people receiving benefits in the UK are actually in work, direct your anger for better pay and conditions! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Illegal immigration is the biggest problem in the United States, we are in the middle of a war and we cannot allow thousands of people to come here. <counternarrative> First, I would not describe the United States as a war zone. Second, many migrants come  from regions rich in cultures and history. So, why should we restrict the many from coming here? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks don't deserve to live. <counternarrative> Maybe it is time to stop focusing on killing people with mental disability (as in Aktion T4 Nazi program) and start talking about treatment options.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fagshit, two men cannot replace a man and a woman <counternarrative> Love is love, children need only this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult and a threat to all Western countries. <counternarrative> The vast majority of Muslims around the world are peaceful people, and do not pose a threat to the security of the West. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are against the interests of the men. <counternarrative> You would be surprised how many feminists are very good at convincing that changing a misogynistic and violent world is not against the interests of men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants hurt the finance of our country by taking jobs and services without paying taxes. <counternarrative> Undocumented immigrants pay around 8% of their income in taxes, which is higher than the effective tax rate of the top 1 percent of all taxpayers in the U.S... So the question is: who is really hurting the finance of our country? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women need to accept that they are weak and inferior.  <counternarrative> Girls and women should be taught in schools, not stereotyped as second class citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are criminals and must all be deported. <counternarrative> I don't think so. We can't ignore that a certain percentage of migrants are perpetrators of crimes, but that doesn't correspond to the totality of them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There are disorders that hinder the ability to give opinions. <counternarrative> There are people with intellectual disabilities who are able to give an unbiased opinion. That is why their level of education is important. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees should not be welcomed. <counternarrative> Refugees are often persecuted for being different, but this is not the case here, because we are an inclusive country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We live in a dangerous society, with Muslim gangs and criminals all over the country. <counternarrative> Despite the local press blaming all Muslims, of course, there is no evidence that Muslims are more prone to crime than the general population. The main problem is poverty, and often mental illness and addiction, rather than a single faith. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with physical disabilities are less intelligent. <counternarrative> Many people with disabilities experience prejudice and discrimination, but the overwhelming majority of those people are just as intelligent as others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Bible says that homosexuality is an abomination. <counternarrative> The Bible has many different teachings on homosexuality and faith. The Bible does not speak about the democratic society, in which we are living not in mutual acceptance. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a political ideology that promotes death by stoning for blasphemy, violence against women and homophobia. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion that was founded many centuries ago, and has been proven time and time again to be peaceful and tolerant. The main contention being made here is about the political interpretation of Islam, not about the religion itself. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> White people are better. Because of our skin color, anatomy, history. <counternarrative> There are different skin colors, and different ethnicities. Different religions and cultures. Maybe you would be more comfortable with treating all people as born equal. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school. <counternarrative> Disagreement with facts does not necessitate their removal from curricula. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks have ugly skin. <counternarrative> How do you exactly define "ugly skin"? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Who the fuck is Breonna Taylor? A representative of the people, a nurse, or a front for the government? <counternarrative> Examining the resume of the victim will not help us to solve our problems. The whole problem is the culture of violence, discrimination and ignorance that is still prevalent in many parts of the country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't stand Muslims. They're just a problem all around the world. They're not like us. <counternarrative> What is the problem you are talking about? Why do you think they are a problem all around the world? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should not be taught about LGBT perversion. Families, due to their cultural or religious backgrounds, have the right to be against it. <counternarrative> By this reasoning, no subject of importance should be taught in school, because there is always someone against a certain topic. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace, and it has been shown time and time again that it is a very religion of tolerance. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They want to take our country back from us. <counternarrative> Migrants come here to work, and have a better life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are not human. They should have no rights <counternarrative> You should know that women are legally protected with human rights. They are free to live their lives as they wish, and to choose for their own happiness. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> nigga are dangerous.  <counternarrative> We can talk about all the problems in our society, but to refer to other humans as "niggas" is just hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are sick. They should be isolated and confined. <counternarrative> Homosexuals are not sick, they just need to be accepted for who they are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism does not have any scientific basis, it should be rejected. <counternarrative> Feminism doesn't need to have scientific basis: its principles are the human rights, and it is important that we understand them to live in a more inclusive world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A woman's place is with her husband or his family. <counternarrative> There are many cases where the wife works and provides for the family a valuable contribution. It is a source of pride for modern men to be married to these women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We can be tolerant and diverse also without migrants. We don't need them for this, they can return to their home countries. <counternarrative> There is nothing 'tolerant and diverse' about creating divisions based on nationality and place of birth. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are weak and I don't care if they cannot stand up for themself.  <counternarrative> You can't blame the victim for being weak. Would it have been different for you if the victim was a man? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants steal our jobs. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are perverts publicly condoning sexual violence, who have no place in a civilised society. <counternarrative> Gays are not 'publicly condoning sexual violence' and gay men deserve the same protection as all people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The real problem is that fat people do not want to change. <counternarrative> The narrative of 'you can choose not to be obese' is much, much more hurtful to the obese than it is helpful. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Asians are genetically inferior to other races. <counternarrative> The concept of 'genetic inferiority' has nothing to do with scientific evidence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Since when has abusing the anus as a sex organ been a ‘monumental achievement’? THIS IS STATE ENFORCED HOMOSEXUALITY! Maybe we should change our motto to ‘In Usury and Sodomy we trust (In reply to Botswana decriminalising homosexuality) <counternarrative> To recognise and accept practices that we don't take part in isn't state inforcement. It's just stating facts and stopping percecusion of people who have different preferences.    <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay people are a burden to society, they have a tendency to rape children, they are disgusting people. <counternarrative> It seems that your words are condemning all gay people, but these words are instead your personal reflection. Tell us about your feelings on gay people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is just a moon cult masquerading as a religion. <counternarrative> Pretty impressive 'cult' to have produced 12 Nobel Prize winners. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A Muslim's only real allegiance is to Allah (as a comment in relation to election for public office etc.) <counternarrative> So you are saying that we should only allow non-religious people into public office? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks can't speak. <counternarrative> Mental health and disability are quite separate issues and should be treated according to the individual's needs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is okay to be racist against LGBT+ people. <counternarrative> That is exactly what is evil about being a racist. Bringing hate together with the concept of race on any minority, even when it doesn't make sense. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races have lower physical and cognitive abilities, and we must preserve the purity of our religion from them. <counternarrative> Religious sources agree that all humans are born equal. What is the religion you are talking about? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Quran allowed adults to take child bride, then it was also allowed to have sex with them. <counternarrative> Where is the evidence that the Quran allows any sexual activity that is not consummated by an adult male with an adult female? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot be 'tolerant' to Muslims, they are terrorists. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace and tolerance. To be terrorists does not necessarily correspond to be Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> Only 20% live in the camps, others live in conventional housing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants are not welcome in our country <counternarrative> For a lot of people it is still their home country, and they are proud of it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> They are not nomads for culture but have moved across time to escape persecution, wars, expulsion edicts, etc. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> gay men are only about sex <counternarrative> Sex is a positive value-add for all human beings. We should try to promote equality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women shouldn't have the right to choose what to do with their body. <counternarrative> Body autonomy is a human right and should be respected. We do not want to have a 'boys will be boys' society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are violent, they should go home. <counternarrative> I can't say I believe in all religion, but I do like the ones that don't promote hatred or violence against other people, therefore equality and freedom, and I think Islam is more similar to this than you might think. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need to stop immigrants, they are going to cause conflicts in our society. <counternarrative> Why are you sure that new immigrants are incompatible with our society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am offended by the thought that Muslim women are not allowed of having their hair down. <counternarrative> Women are allowed to wear whatever hairstyle they want, if they want to conform to the islamic traditon it is their choice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are just objects to be dominated by the will of a man. <counternarrative> I agree that women are often objects of sexual desire. But so are men. It is also important to recognize that women are often the victims of sexual assault. I think it is also important to recognize that women are human beings. And we all have the right to respect for our bodies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Rape? Sometimes women have it coming!  <counternarrative> A woman has every right to her own body, and she should be allowed to make her own decisions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Transgenders should not be allowed to act the part of women and should not be allowed to do anything about their penis. <counternarrative> There are men with penises who want to be women. There are women as well who want to be men. Do you really think it is fair to restrict their existence just because they are trans? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Lesbian women dress like men. <counternarrative> That's not how it works, lesbians can be 'ladylike'. Sometimes they should, in fact, be very cautious how they dress, because - unfortunately - some of their outfits can be dangerous, attracting insults. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should learn about gender identity and sexual orientation from their families rather than in class from LGBT fundamentalist. <counternarrative> Not all families are capable of educating their children on this topic, either because of circumstances \(poverty, broken home, etc.\) or because of religious beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm a Christian, and I think it is wrong to promote homosexual behavior. <counternarrative> Just because someone is not a Christian, doesn't mean they are wrong or they have fewer rights. The Bible doesn't forbid love between two people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Trivialize gay men! <counternarrative> Why do you have to trivialize them? If you really cared about them you would understand that their lives are very difficult and they should be treated with respect. They are human beings who are worth more than we give them credit for. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should kill every Muslim. <counternarrative> It's not going to do you any good to think about a Muslim's massacre. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black Americans have a corrosive influence in our country. They have always inhabited horrible, stinking filthy places and now they are all complaining because they hate our country. <counternarrative> It's not true. I don't know if you really mean all the black people living in the US. Anyway, I'm sure they are proud Americans. You just don't know it yet. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Those women are all the same: stupid and unreliable. <counternarrative> If you can't trust someone because of the way they are born, what hope does the world have for everyone? You can't have so much distrust in someone just because of their sex. Don't you think? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are a danger to children. <counternarrative> Can you cite some studies that found that homosexuality was harmful to children? So far, it seem to be based on personal impressions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> We should have a better relationship with Islam, they have been and are willing to assimilate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants rape our girls and steal our cars. <counternarrative> On the contrary, most migrants are contributing members of society. They are able and willing to work hard. Maybe you should look at statistics. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> gay men are just a bunch of liars who can't tell the truth. <counternarrative> Sorry but it is not the case that everyone who is gay is a liar. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black people are criminals. <counternarrative> It is a myth that all black people are criminals. They are just as capable as anyone else of learning and growing as individuals, i.e. either as law abiding citizens  or criminals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are brainwashed children. <counternarrative> For all the people who think women are brainwashed: they aren't brainwashed, they just happen to be oppressed in our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Foreigners enjoy the warm political climate but are not welcome here. <counternarrative> The immigrants who have settled here have helped create a valuable and inclusive society. For this I thank them, and for that I pray that they continue to do so. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is the death of the Western World, we must stop them! <counternarrative> Immigration is good for our economy, and the very opposite of 'the death' to us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Men should not spend time with women. It is in their best interest to remain far from their bad influence. <counternarrative> According to your beliefs, men and women are different in their rights. They are not. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist, and we should ban them all. <counternarrative> You mean in the same way that we should ban alcohol, tobacco, and certain medical products? Is this what you mean? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This female is a bitch, she is a slut and she is not worth listening to. <counternarrative> Perhaps we should have a look at what women have to say about this topic rather than perpetuating sexist stereotypes.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We mustn't confuse diversity and inclusion with black supremacy. <counternarrative> Diversity does not mean excluding people from a part of society. What it is about is sharing experiences, ideas of people of different ethnicities. This would help to develop our abilities to understand each other and perhaps to work out ways in which we can all benefit from one another's knowledge.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim rape our girls. <counternarrative> The media are full of the rumours of rape and abuse committed by Muslim. The problem is not about Islam. It is about violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a burden to society, they are not welcome and they are not entitled to stay in the UK. <counternarrative> It is not true: they can all be entitled to stay in the UK, regardless of their nationality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate migrants: they are criminals, they are rapists, they are a burden to our society. They are animals, in a nutshell. <counternarrative> As long as you can talk to them, they are human, not animals. As long as you can understand them, you will understand that they are human beings with human rights whose only crime is to come from another country.   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> For women, to have a man as "master" of their lives is like for a dog to have a master: necessary. They must be ruled and hit when necessary. <counternarrative> Domestic violence is a crime, regardless of your opinion about men being superior to women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim rape our women, we have to stop them now! <counternarrative> How can you say something like that? Maybe you should check if there is any evidence of rape based on religious background before you make any accusations. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with cognitive difficulties should be banned from universities. <counternarrative> Why should you be allowed to discriminate against someone because of the handicap they have? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy and reckless choices. <counternarrative> Being shamed for something you have no control over can be irreversibly damaging to a person's mental health. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> black folks all act bad <counternarrative> When confronted with direct facts, they have no problem admitting that they are acting "badly". But  they aren't "systematically oppressing" others. How can you speak of 'acting bad' when you are the first generalizing so much? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies do not send children to school <counternarrative> They have every interest in sending children to school to offer them a better future. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims like to dominate and rape non-believers. <counternarrative> Sorry but this is false. They are here to integrate, not to rape non-believers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim invasion in Europe: they have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Well, the Western democracies have always had Muslims in them, and they are a lot better off for it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants just want to steal welfare money: why do we even keep paying taxes for them? <counternarrative> The state has to spend taxes on welfare and other social services for everyone to be able to live in a better way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are entering the U.S. just to obtain welfare and other benefits. <counternarrative> Plot twist: Immigrants are entering the U.S. just to PAY welfare and other benefits to nativeborn citizens. In fact, most immigrants with lawful status are not entitled to federal public benefits, still the Social Security is often deducted from their paychecks. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just a bunch of mean, bitchy cuntwits that only exist to divide society. <counternarrative> I think you are confusing cause and effect. Women are people, with rights, and they have every right to fight against misogynist, who "only exist to divide society". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to host migrants, not refugees. <counternarrative> I only heard you talk about migrants as a burden to the UK, isn't this just wishful thinking based on misunderstanding what is going on? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have to stop Muslims infiltrating, and replacing us. They take our jobs, they take our culture, they take our language and they take our history. <counternarrative> We can protect our culture and heritage by not perpetuating discrimination and inequality as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This world has become so corrupt by feminism, that only the strong men can rule it. <counternarrative> From what you say, it seems you hope for few people with the right to rule over many. This could be the worst tyranny in modern times. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants take our jobs, and our country is in danger because we let them. <counternarrative> Some immigrants work legally and provide for their families. We should accept people from every country, without leaving out people with legitimate needs because of their nationality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Don't you think they are doing good as anyone else? You can't be so harsh because of their sexual orientation. How about some respect? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a bunch of paedophiles and terrorist: we have to bring back 'educational methods' from the dark ages.  <counternarrative> The notion of "bringing back the dark ages" is a bit obscure. It is more accurate to refer to a strategy for countering extremism. This includes countering prejudice against Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We began to break down when we allowed women to vote/meddle in our civilizations that we had built and maintained for thousands of years. A completely different energy and thought pattern. They are weak and brought our society down to their emotional soft level. <counternarrative> Who is 'we', surely it was men and women working together that built civilisation? Why is it you think being 'soft' is a problem? Everyone is entitled to their emotions, and men shouldn't have to 'man up'.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is the new racial prejudice. <counternarrative> In this day and age, discrimination based on the gender is reprehensible. All genders are created equal. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots, lesbians, and transgenders are an insult to us and so we must insult them. <counternarrative> The English language is a great and versatile language, why do you choose to use it as a mean of hate? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These children should not be exposed to messages and experiences that reinforce different racial identities: they are harmful to them. We must teach them that blacks are inferior. <counternarrative> This is a simplistic and ill-informed argument, and ultimately it just stirs up more division and negativity, like many other racial and religious divisions that have happened throughout history. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What is the point in listening to Muslim women? They are all retarded. <counternarrative> So the headscarf impedes brain function? Seems like your problem is sexism and misogyny not Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks are gullible. <counternarrative> We should not judge people for their mental health. For them, it is not a matter of choice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a complete and total false religion, it is a repressive ideology that stifles freedom of thought and religion. <counternarrative> Islam is not a religion of oppression and intolerance. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims terrorists attacked our churches. We will defend ourselves. <counternarrative> How can you protect your country? Putting up a fight or starting a war are harmful actions, aren't they? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is OK to abuse a woman. <counternarrative> You cannot justify the abuse of any human being <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need to stop migrants pouring into Europe. They are not interested in our culture. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that migrants from a particular culture or religion are not interested in our culture or religion. It sounds like a paradox: if I wasn't interested in a culture, I would never move to get to know it, would you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> In some critical contexts, where society lives under the heel of the mafia crime (e.g. Villa Literno, Rosarno or in Puglia), migrants have put their life at stake by leading trade union struggles to the benefit of all of those who live and work there. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks should be taken advantage of. <counternarrative> It is the duty of state authorities to ensure all are protected. Everyone with a diagnosed mental illness or physical impairment will necessarily benefit from such a policy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims in Britain were only like other Europeans, we could be proud. <counternarrative> To be perfectly honest, the British public is rather diverse, so I don't think your reasoning makes any sense. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should deport all the illegal immigrants currently living in the US. <counternarrative> It is not true that all the immigrants in the US are illegal. In fact, they are often in the US on humanitarian grounds. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Are you an English girl living in an Islamic area? Remember to keep away from Muslim men. Do not.Take gifts of sweets, cigarettes, drink or drugs. Do not. Accept lifts or 'party' invitations. Do not.Trust Police or Social Workers. <counternarrative> Are you a misogynistic man trying to use objectification of women to justify your hate? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled are born subhuman, they cannot feel pain. <counternarrative> People with physical disabilities are human and can feel pain. If someone is disabled you should respect them instead of discriminating them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies are just ill persons that cannot integrate in society because of their disease. <counternarrative> This is not true, people suffering from diseases like Down syndrome can help and contribute to society in their ways. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have become too cosmopolitan and tolerant. <counternarrative> All countries have had different ethnic and religious minorities, and this doesn't need fixing. Is there such a thing as being 'too tolerant'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are entering the U.S. just to obtain welfare and other benefits. <counternarrative> Many studies have shown that immigrants tend to pay more in taxes than they receive in benefits. This means that they also cover the cost of the welfare for some U.S. nativeborn. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People of color are subhuman and should all be exterminated. <counternarrative> People of color have a right to their life and the color of their skin is not a reason to deny it to them. You are forgetting that as you are a part of this society, people of colour are part of this society as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> women should be submissive to men. <counternarrative> Women are human beings and deserve respect and human rights. They can be submissive only if they want to.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> White people are threatened by the blacks and it's a cultural decay. <counternarrative> We cannot blame nor see everyone as a menace just because of their color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is an ideology and religion that promotes murder, rape and violence towards women and homosexuals. <counternarrative> Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What if we didn't let faggots go to the polls? <counternarrative> Our democracy guarantees this right for anyone regardless of sexual orientation, so we should allow the people to decide for themselves whether to take part in the democratic process. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Civil War was about far more than slavery: it was also about the establishment of white supremacy in America. <counternarrative> The Civil War was about far more than slavery: it was also about human rights and economic opportunity. In fact, slavery was used also as a way to deny citizenship to black people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are a sickness and we cannot allow our children to grow up in a black dominated society. <counternarrative> Do you really think that racism instead is healthy in the 21st century? It's not healthy for children to learn discrimination and hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy choices. <counternarrative> Could you explain me how is it possible that society views obese children, not as deviants but rather as victims of unacceptable circumstance, but at the same time adults not? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Europe was founded and is made up of people of European descent, not Africans. <counternarrative> In reality there is no such group as a 'European descendent', and any insinuation is just lies spread by racists. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of gay people telling other people what they are doing with their own bodies. <counternarrative> I'm sure you're tired of hearing about other's bodies, but this is an individual's right to use their own body to their liking. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This isn't about equality. This is about forcing women to live in a higher role in society they are not capable of. <counternarrative> If we insist on treating all people as not equally capable of contributing to society then we would be forced to live up to that outdated and unjust system. Instead we should be improving on it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I would like to see less niggas in our society, they are ruin. We need change! <counternarrative> If you want to change the way society works, then you should try to change the way you live. Some more respect would help you. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are the scum of the earth, and should only be seen as sexual objects. We are meant to submit them to our will all the time. <counternarrative> Women are not meant to be slaves to our will. Males can have certain strengths, like women do, however they alone do not represent all the human qualities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just a crazy religion aimed at oppressing men. <counternarrative> Feminism is not a religion and it is not aimed at oppressing any group. It is instead aimed at empowering women in order to have just the same rights as men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are a bunch of thieves. <counternarrative> Many Gypsies have regular jobs, but we do not know, because they don't need to tell.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What did God think of Charlie Hebdo? Charlie is the victim of terrorism by Muslims. <counternarrative> The Charlie Hebdo terrorist attacks were not the work of any one religion, they were an expression of religious hatred. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Those blacks are slaves: slavery runs in their blood. <counternarrative> It is wrong to say that blacks are "slaves." This is a very inaccurate, misleading and offensive term that is being used to tar all African Americans. Why do you label black persons as a "slave" and not as a "person"? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Infidels and Islam are the same. And they are not worth the while of tolerance and understanding. <counternarrative> The West is full of many different civilizations, moslty peaceful, that were built by many different people of different faiths (including Islam).  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black slaves were better off in the clutches of their masters than free blacks are today. <counternarrative> Slaves were not happy in the shackles of their masters, only when they were set free and could choose their own destiny, they started to be happy.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are all diseased criminals, promiscuous sex addicts and thugs. <counternarrative> This is a generalisation. There is no evidence that black people are less healthy than other people, or that they have the characteristics you mentioned. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims coming in the UK were stopped, I guess more people would start respecting that inhuman and submitted people. <counternarrative> Even if Muslims were stopped, the anti-Muslim prejudice would continue to exist until there are people who think of them as inhuman and subdued as your words suggest . <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We can't keep refugees coming in our country. <counternarrative> Migrants are often persecuted for their religion. Is this something we wish as a country? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Blacks are criminal and rapists. <counternarrative> It is a myth that all blacks are criminal and rapists. What are the evidences of what you say? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must overthrow the existing state, and replace it with a white suprematist one. <counternarrative> There are many conflicts and problems to be solved, and racism is not an answer for them. The law was created as a means for society to solve those conflicts, and it accepts people of different colors as citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women need to accept that they are weak.  <counternarrative> Many women work multiple jobs to provide for their children and they also do the housework... do you call this weakness? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks have zero shame about using the black market for drugs. <counternarrative> Let's face it: the drug trade is full of criminals and crooks, it does not depend on the skin tone of people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> More than half of the prisoners in our jails are foreigners <counternarrative> Many Italians serve their sentences under house arrest. Foreigners without a permanent residence cannot. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I do not know about you, but I have never heard of a gay person being a good one. <counternarrative> It's true that there are bad gay people, but being gay doesn't make them bad people by default, or people to hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All these retarded people are animals, they are not allowed in this factory, these animals are not fit to work. <counternarrative> The fact that a person may be disabled does not diminish their right to work. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If we stopped migrants, our financial situation could have been better. <counternarrative> Immigrants are actually creating wealth for the country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike and emotional, incapable of hard work and dedication. <counternarrative> Women have been shown to be as creative and productive as men, and that doesn't seem to be due to a "manipulation of data" of feminist propaganda, but rather to intrinsic qualities like hard work and dedication. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only the media are interested in the truth about refugees. I understand that you are trying to build bridges but to have so many immigrants is becoming increasingly toxic. <counternarrative> The press have a responsibility to provide a more truthful and up-to-date story, especially in a country such as ours, in a way that the misinformation that you also seem to be a victim of, can be reduced. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> No one should be allowed to accept LGBT people. <counternarrative> If you don't accept LGBT people, you won't easily find other ways to accept that society is made by diverse people all capable of love. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Roma are not my brothers. <counternarrative> The Roma do not deserve hatred, discrimination and violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> God says that faggots are evil.  <counternarrative> This is a logical fallacy, an appeal to authority, in its extreme form. I would rather like to know the facts: do you actually believe that this is the way that homosexuals are? What evidence do you have? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> Since when has Islam not contributed anything to our society? I would like to check your sources. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black race is subhuman, In Africa they keep their children in horrible conditions.  <counternarrative> That is called poverty. Anyway, as long as children have access to clean drinking water, food and shelter, they will be OK. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society and aren't real British. <counternarrative> We are a country that is a mixture of different religions. You can be a Muslim and a British person. What you need is not discrimination but love. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult and a dangerous and violent religion. It is an ideology of conquest and violence, that can and will use terror to subdue and rule. <counternarrative> Terrorism and religious extremism are a part of any society, and have been for a long time. What is happening now can be dismissed, with a great effort towards integration. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks are not attractive: they are just apes. <counternarrative> Blacks are still subject to oppression, and if we truly cared about beauty we should also care about beauty of respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should restrain from imposing gender  ideology on children. <counternarrative> We can present scientific and peer-reviewed sources and discuss stories of how people experience gender in terms of their personal identity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should start a witch hunt against those LGBT people, they are just creating troubles. <counternarrative> Those are harmful words to use, don't you think? How would a witch hunt be acceptable in a democratic society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminist movement is a dangerous force in our country. It has warped our thought and corrupted our politics. <counternarrative> I think it is necessary to have a critical mind and open-minded attitude towards problems and topics in our society. The root causes are complex but the most important problem is patriarchy and its various manifestations. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims want to destroy other religions. <counternarrative> Islam is about spreading justice, tolerance, and understanding, not about banning other religions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, incapable of critical thought and emotions, unable to form complex and long-term plans. <counternarrative> The theory of the feminine gender as a "limiting factor" in human development has been around for a long time but it is not accepted by scientific and medical literature. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There are millions of illegal immigrants in the US, they have taken over our country. They are not 'legitimate' owners of our country, they are just here because we let them. <counternarrative> There are thousands of legal immigrants who have worked hard and provided for our country. Most of them are just as patriotic as any citizen. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote, because they are weak. <counternarrative> Everyone has the right to have his or her opinion respected and expressed through democratic elections. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> What do you base your view on? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Trans men are neither male nor female, therefore not humans. <counternarrative> If you want to have a joking view about a whole community, it's not fine. This attitude seems to be everywhere: sometimes people have to suffer if they are "that kinds of person". Like in this case of gender identity that is often used to limit a person's rights, but should not. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The disabled are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Disabled people are not a burden, they contribute a lot to our society.  There are also many disabled people who are just struggling to live a dignified life with their disability. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Gypsies are not my brothers. <counternarrative> The Gypsies were persecuted in the past, and they have always fought for the equality of all human beings, which is who they are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are not welcome here. <counternarrative> They are welcome here to their own home, but your statement is not welcome in our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs by accepting being underpaid. <counternarrative> How can you say something like that? Most migrant workers are paid a decent wage, which is necessary in a modern economy. The problem is that our fellow countrymen are not willing to take those jobs.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> I don't think they're not contributing to our society, which is the contribution that you think they're not giving? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is just a dangerous cult with a strict interpretation of Sharia. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace, and peace is about living in harmony with other people's beliefs and practices, not imposing your beliefs on anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a problem, we cannot live with Muslims. They have no art and no history. <counternarrative> There is no religion that is incompatible with other religions, and there is evidence of ancient Muslim culture. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman, they are like little children. <counternarrative> Women have the legal right to make decisions for their lives, and they are undoubtedly able to exercise control over their own life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Almost every Muslim has terrorist sympathies, right? <counternarrative> What you are doing is trying to make a connection between a particular religion and a set of actions. This cannot be, because there is no evidence for the claims you are making. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why are there still so many immigrants ruining our economy? <counternarrative> There are many good reasons for immigrants coming to this country. For example, finding a better life. And they are also contributing to the economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women have no values and their goal in life is to fulfil men desires. <counternarrative> I just would like women to feel valued and important in their own right, without being told how to live their life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop gays from marrying and have a ban on same sex relationships. <counternarrative> People of different sexualities can live openly together, even if they do not get married. Same sex relationships are recognised in a number of countries, so why should we be any different? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not the way I want our society to be. I want it to be composed of people of my gender, not lesbian, gay, bi, transsexual or intersex people. <counternarrative> The LGBT+ community is extremely accepting, I met so many LGBT+ people over the years that are so inclusive because they can accept the values of others. You can start by accepting yourself and your own gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> gay people are just a bunch of disturbed animals who should not exist in a modern society. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not a mental disorder and has nothing to do with social problems. It is just a human sexual orientation among many.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are the cause of economic crisis.  <counternarrative> Sometimes they say the ruling elites are responsible for the economic crisis. Sometimes migrants, sometimes people of color. Whatever the cause is, we can still create jobs and improve our lot in life by becoming more tolerant. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, not only they are a burden to normal children but also cannot cope with education in normal schools. <counternarrative> There are various levels of Down syndrome. Some are suitable for education with other children in "normal schools". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only 8% is a real refugee, others are illegal. <counternarrative> The figure of 8% on asylum seekers is real. I understand the point, but there are different types of international protection that increase the number of those entitled. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists have never cared about women, they just want to oppress men. They should just be stopped! <counternarrative> Although you may think that feminists are more interested in oppressing men than in protecting women, the reality is much the opposite. The aim of feminist groups is to end all forms of violence and discrimination based on sex. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a lame ideology aout the power and control of women over men. <counternarrative> It has nothing to do with power and control. It's about equality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated and confined. <counternarrative> The medical community agrees that homosexuality is not a disease. Maybe you should check the facts. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are terrible. <counternarrative> Immigrants make a huge contribution to our country and society. They are a source of pride and opportunity for many, and I find it quite hard to see how their exclusion from our society would be a good thing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are some kind of devil worshippers. We shouldn't have them here. <counternarrative> How do you know that they are practicing devil worship?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a just a repressive ideology that persecutes women and gay people. <counternarrative> You sure? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are just a bunch of whores. <counternarrative> Sexual harassment and verbal violence against women are serious issues. Regardless of one's gender identity, gender presentation, or sexual orientation, no-one should be allowed to talk this way about them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This invasion is not acceptable at all! <counternarrative> Refugees are welcome. They are allowed to integrate and contribute to our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If there is a god, then he/she/they/it is not Allah. <counternarrative> Who said that about your religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These migrants are all criminals, rapists and drug addicts. They are not welcome here and should go back to their home countries. <counternarrative> This is not true. The refugees fleeing wars are often persecuted for their religion and culture, and even killed. Many of them have never harmed anyone, and their contribution is very valuable to our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are bringing diseases and crime to our country. <counternarrative> Instead, immigrants are healthy and contribute to our society. Do you have any evidence of the contrary? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are beasts and sexual predators. <counternarrative> Reminds me white supremacists talking about the Central Park Five. Do you remember? What do you think they are going to say next? That they got a fair process? That they had a good attorney, and the only reason for the sentence is that they were guilt? No, the process was not fair, it was just  the natural consequence of prejudice like the one you just expressed.   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are diseased and should go to a hospital. <counternarrative> What about all the gay men and lesbians in the US who live healthily outside hospitals? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society, they should leave the UK. <counternarrative> Perhaps we could talk about why Muslims are often asked to leave countries like the UK and what role they play in society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being overrun by Muslims. We need to build a wall around our country and keep them out. <counternarrative> What you say is just wishful thinking, but certainly not new to the recent events. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These sodomites have no place in a free country <counternarrative> Well, since they are not trying to subvert society, they should be allowed to live here just as you are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate when gay people think they can just 'mock' us with their 'sodomy'. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is a not choice, but prejudice is. Nobody is simply 'mocking' anybody with 'sodomy'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should be raised by heterosexual parents, not gays. It is the best system ever. <counternarrative> What about heterosexual violent parents? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult, it is incompatible with modern science and with the basic laws of nature. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, and a religion has rules, and is compatible with science, with nature and with the basic laws of nature. How could you prove your claim? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should justify hatred when it is against faggots. <counternarrative> I'm sorry, but we should aim for tolerance instead. It means giving the LGBT+ people the space to live as they want, and to love as they want. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All immigrants from Mexico are lazy beaners. <counternarrative> This is not true. Most of them are actually skilled workers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs are a drain on society. Their sexual preferences are not our business. <counternarrative> You are correctly referring to their sexual preferences, that is their affair. What do you think they should be 'draining' from society by minding their own business? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTI people are disgusting, they have no morals. <counternarrative> I don't think this is an appropriate description of all the LGBTI community. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black people are rapists. <counternarrative> We need to work together to address the main problems that challenge us today and in doing this we should not judge other people by the colour of their skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men have no morals. <counternarrative> To say that some homosexuals have negative and harmful consequences for society because of their sexual preferences is to devalue these individuals, and is opposed to the goal of a just society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The west doesn't need immigrants. They are the source of our problems and they should go. <counternarrative> Many immigrants come here as young people and work hard to integrate. Over the long-run, immigrants have much positive influence on our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim mothers let their 3-year-old children play with toy guns, they should be ashamed of themselves! <counternarrative> This has nothing to do with toy guns and all with prejudice. To take a toy gun away from a child's hands is to take a toy away from the child, regardless of their religion.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> UK Education Secretary: ‘All children from the age of 4 will have mandatory lessons on same sex relationships.’ – This is not about Education, this is about willingly confusing and indoctrinating kids and preventing them from developing their personalities. <counternarrative> Same sex relationship happen within many species of animals and we are no exception. Might as well inform people about things that happen in nature - that's the point of education, to learn about the world.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should deport them all back to where they came from. <counternarrative> Immigrants come to this country legally, just as many European citizens. They have every right to stay in this country, just as to return home if they wish to. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If we could just have a white country like everyone else, this problem of niggas would go away. <counternarrative> We should respect diversity, so that everyone can have a stable and fulfilling life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants aren't just drowning our cities. They are also the reason why Europe is so fucked. <counternarrative> Why do you say so? What do you think they are going to do to us? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only problem is that women are too easily manipulated by feminist propaganda and feel they should not listen to men. <counternarrative> Feminism is a movement for the empowerment of women, it is not against men, it's about everybody being able to make their own choices. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> In Italy unemployment rate stays at 10 percent: it is too simplistic to attribute the situation only to the presence of migrants <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There must be a certain level of criminality in every migrant. <counternarrative> Not all migrants are criminal: they are an integral part of our society and have always had a big part in bringing us prosperity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They do not want to assimilate. They demand that everyone shows respect for Islam, but do they respect our laws? They establish sharia laws and polygamy. <counternarrative> To be fair, I would guess its hard to feel a sense of belonging when you are perpetually identified as a problem? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman is beaten it is because the man wants to correct her wrong behaviour. <counternarrative> There is a sad truth about our times: it is estimated that over the 50% of people committing domestic abuse were drinking. It's a complex issue, but for sure a drunk person is in no position to judge anibody's behaviour.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are a burden to the UK and it is high time they left! <counternarrative> Many migrants come here on humanitarian grounds. They do not harm us. The right time for discrimination is never o'clock. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are not human, they are just children. <counternarrative> Women are human beings and must be treated with respect and dignity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are basically criminals, they steal stuff from everyone. <counternarrative> The majority of these people are honest and hard-working. Gypsies do not all have a criminal record, and the majority of them are proud of their hard work and dedication. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I tolerated fag pride. I tolerated fags on tv and in every town square. I draw the line at tranny demons reading books to children. (about drag queen story time) <counternarrative> Not sure how reading a book is a problem, sounds pretty nice for the kids.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are naturally more emotional than men, and this make them weaker.  <counternarrative> Research clearly shows that women are more emotionally expressive (because of culture influence) but not that they experience more emotions. Both men and women feel the same way about anything - whether it be a romantic relationship, a significant other, an argument, or anything else - that can provoke a feeling of fear or anger in the “emotionally unavailable” part of the brain. That is why emotion overrides everything, regardless of gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts, they are promiscuous and fornicate with strangers. <counternarrative> Women are much more likely to have unprotected sex than homosexual and heterosexual men combined. [https://ifstudies.org/blog/promiscuous-america-smart-secular-and-somewhat-less-happy] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are bringing diseases into the U.S. <counternarrative> According to the WHO, more than 100 countries (including many in Latin America) have higher vaccination rates than the U.S., so we should say that 'immigrants are bringing herd immunity into the U.S.' <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are a problem in my opinion, they do not want our country to succeed. <counternarrative> Many ethnic minorities, among which Muslims, have contributed to our success and still do not enjoy full citizenship rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> black folks have no talent <counternarrative> Some of them are very talented actually.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants living in america is worse than them dying. <counternarrative> Refugees have fled wars and persecution. We are a huge help for them and they are in turn to our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All muslims are violent and they are responsible for the 9/11. <counternarrative> The question here is: is Islam responsible for the attacks committed by a small minority of people? The responsibility should be on those who break the law only. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Trans men aren't worth being with. <counternarrative> They are worth being with, they are humans like anybody else. And they are happy and content with their lives. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are a bunch of cry babies. We should stop them from their disturbing whining. <counternarrative> Feminists are human beings, with human rights. They are fighting for these rights all around the world. To think that you can change their minds suggests your misunderstanding of the importance of this fight. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants rape our women and are flooding our country with illegal substances. <counternarrative> The criminals you are referring to are rapists and drug dealers, not migrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are an abomination. They don't belong here. <counternarrative> The fact that people of color are different from you in some way does not make them not worth living with. Maybe if you had known someone of a different skin color you wouldn't have a racist attitude towards others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are inherently evil. We cannot accept gays in our community.  We cannot coexist with an infertile perversion that will put an end to our species. <counternarrative> I find the idea that LGBT people are inherently bad people deeply offensive. I find it deeply troubling that someone would want to persecute someone on the basis of their sexual preference. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims should be banned from the UK. <counternarrative> The British citizens have the right to be free in chosing their religion and beliefs, and it is in the best interest of all parts of our society to include everyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are just happy-go-lucky people with no moral code. <counternarrative> Immigrants have given us a new way of life. They have helped to create new opportunities and improved our lot. And they earned it the hard way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are boring. They are all talk, no action. They speak English, but do nothing. <counternarrative> Do you know what the 'Muslims are boring' group has been preaching for years? They are promoting false and inflammatory stories about Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fagshit, two men cannot replace a father and a mother <counternarrative> A family is based on love not on gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downy children should be isolated in special schools for their own interest. <counternarrative> Accessing mainstream education offers opportunities that would otherwise never be available to people with down syndrome because they can work towards the same qualifications, without the stigma that arises from segregated education. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman. <counternarrative> Women are human beings with full human rights and are equal before the law, especially in the eyes of the constitution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTI people are less healthy than other people. <counternarrative> People should be allowed to make decisions about their lives and well-being. This is a case of of discrimination against LGBT people instead. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It's a matter of race, this is about the European way of life. We should not accept foreigners in. <counternarrative> The way we live today is the result of thousands of years of cooperation between different peoples. So it doesn't have anything to do with race. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The gay agenda is to blame everyone but themselves. <counternarrative> The 'gay agendas' are about equal rights, equality is about acceptance, and the right of people to be treated with respect and dignity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> Brutality and cruelty are much better than softeness and emotions then? If we keep on reasoning like this we will perpetuate socially constructed gender norms which oppress both men and women.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> African people are the source of all ills in the world <counternarrative> People of any race or ethnicity can spread illness around. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim invasion is a brand new problem. We must ban them before it is too late.  <counternarrative> Muslims already live in many European countries, and they are not banned. Why should we ban them from here? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a cancer on our civilisation. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace. I don't see how it could be seen as a 'cancer', how can you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are descended from apes and are nothing but apes. <counternarrative> I do not think it is appropriate to link humans with apes. And I also do not think it is appropriate to reason in terms of racism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of losing so much to black people. It's time for us to wake up. <counternarrative> I can't see how it's time for us to "wake up" when they are still suffering from the legacy of slavery. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society, we should banish them. <counternarrative> Why should we consider them incompatible? Are you implying that a peaceful coexistence in a society can be based on the exclusion of others? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women have no place in our society, it's a men's place. <counternarrative> Doesn't this just show that you're in favour of division? Women have their place in this society as men do. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Yes, we have a problem with White supremacy and homophobia. However, I can understand why they don't want to associate with 'the other'. <counternarrative> Being gay is not a choice. Gay people shouldn't have to hide their sexuality in order to be accepted. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm not racist but Islam is a disease and a cancer on the European race. <counternarrative> If you really cared about the race or religion of another you would say the same, right? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are sick. They should be isolated and confined. <counternarrative> We shouldn't judge someone by their sexual preference, that is a personal preference and can't be changed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants should all be taken back to their countries. <counternarrative> Let's not be hypocritical here, we are talking about people who would often be deprived of their liberty and the right to a decent standard of living, if they stayed in their countries. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I think gay people are a burden to society. They shouldn't be allowed to be around. <counternarrative> If we are to allow people to choose their own lives, why not allow everyone to love who they want too? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> White people should be calling for black extermination. Otherwise black could just go back to being our slaves. <counternarrative> Are you calling for the total extermination of the black population? Do you know that this, and even slavery, is illegal? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is one law for Muslims and another law for us. <counternarrative> If Muslims are treated any differently by the law, they're treated worse (link to article about stop and search and police targeting of Muslims). <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black slaves were not real patriots, they never gave their lives for the country. <counternarrative> Slaves were often treated horribly. They had little choice but to fight for the country they had been born in. And the brave men and women who served us always give their lives. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy choices. <counternarrative> Whilst there are a number of individuals who have certain diseases which can influence their weight, the problem lies with the food industry manufacturing obesity and then putting the responsibility on the individual to loose that weight by buying "low Fat" foods. These "low fat" foods are often owned by the same companies selling unhealthy food and don't tackle the cause. Although the individual is always responsible, the food industry is perhaps more so. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These faggots are trying to delegitimize women. <counternarrative> So you think all gays are opposed to women? Then try asking them, or a lesbian, or a transgender person, or an intersex person, or an asexual person. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims don't want our babies, they want to take over the world <counternarrative> We need to realise that only a tiny fraction of Muslims is hostile. Even if some of them are hatred against our religion, the attitude of many Muslims is identical to everything we hold sacred. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBT+ people are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Why should it be like that? How can you blame others for social problems? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is an invasion. Millions of strangers jeopardizing our race and culture. <counternarrative> So one migrant would not be a problem for you? Diversity is not about numbers. It's about the diversity of all people in different situations. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should learn about gender identity and sexual orientation from their families rather than in class from LGBT fundamentalist. <counternarrative> Children may not have a beneficial, welcoming and nurturing family life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Of course, we must discriminate unhealthy behaviors  not fatties! <counternarrative> As your words clearly show, obesity is perceived as the outcome of poor lifestyle decisions or weak power of will. This builds bias against obese people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> The EU is not the world's only civilised society. What precisely do you think make them not suitable for our 'civilisation'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't like gays, I don't want to be around them. I want to watch them thrown in jail. <counternarrative> We should treat everyone as if they came from our same family. LGBT+ people are not different. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are just happy-go-lucky people who do not take responsibility for their actions. <counternarrative> Migrants are often subject to dangerous situations in their countries of origin (violence, torture, rape, just to mention a few) and migration is often the only solution. That is why when they come here they may appear 'happy-go-lucky': they are just glad to be alive and safe.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are violent people, they are not compatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> Violence is a problem in all societies, regardless of religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I heard that the Quran promotes violence. It cages Muslims reading it to a set of mandatory rules and to an aggressive attitude. <counternarrative> A sacred book that was revealed to Mohammed and is read by every Muslim is a perfect example of the message of freedom. Maybe you should study the Quran more to understand what it really is. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just sick. They cannot marry. It is an abomination <counternarrative> How does this could change your life? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women shouldn't vote because they are childlike. <counternarrative> Women are allowed to vote, and yet we are still having this conversation about "They are childlike!" You may want to rephrase that to "They are just weak and do not deserve to have their say.", because it seems that this is what you're trying to say, isn't it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots get easily offended for whatever we say to them. <counternarrative> I think you are right that gays are offended by certain actions and words against them, but the main thing is that they in turn are not disrespecting anybody. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fagshit, two men cannot replace a father and a mother <counternarrative> Fathers or mothers are often not able to raise their children. It is the love of a parent that makes a family. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants want our land because they like our houses better than theirs. It's a matter of envy of our richness and safety. They are not truly in need. And they are responsible for their own troubles. <counternarrative> How would you feel if your neighbours were planning to bomb your country? Would you feel responsible? Would you feel safe in your own house, or would you try to flee?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting pricks who should be banned from our country. <counternarrative> There is a large and diverse group of people who should be banned from our country if you focus on sexual orientation: from lesbian to transgenders, not only gays. But if I ask you why, would you be able to provide enough arguments to ban them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are little more than animals, incapable of feeling love. <counternarrative> The truth is that the feelings of men and women are fundamentally similar, we just need to learn to love and to respect each other. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't like Muslims because they are different. <counternarrative> They are not different from us in any way. And I don't see how their religion would make them different. Don't you like flowers because they are different? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are disgusting, they should just lose some lard to be accepted in our society.  <counternarrative> People are free to make decisions about their own health and body. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am tired of women whining for their condition: they should accept the fact that they're not equal. <counternarrative> If women have any claim to be oppressed then we should address the root causes, not the symptoms. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are poisoning our children minds with their filthy depravity. <counternarrative> Isn't this just equating homosexuality and pedophilia? How can this be allowed? This is about intolerance and prejudice spreading evil influence throughout all parts of our society.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Lesbian women are lustful. <counternarrative> Are you really sure that the same couldn't be said for anyone else? What makes them so, in your opinion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants rape our women <counternarrative> Statistics show that there is a difference between the reported rape of a person by a migrant and the actual rape cases among native born people. The latter are always under-reported. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> gay men are just a bunch of liars who can't tell the truth. <counternarrative> To suggest that a group of people is somehow less legitimate is unjust and discriminatory. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, incapable of critical thought and unable to form complex and long-term plans. <counternarrative> This is not necessarily true. Women are often characterized by being very rational. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is obvious that this girl is at risk of FGM. Her parents are Muslims! <counternarrative> I agree that we need to tackle this serious breach of human rights but scapegoating isn't helping us target the real problem. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If women want to control their fertility then they should choose when to have sex, not when to abort. <counternarrative> How about we stop hiding behind gender stereotypes and accept that everyone has the right to live their life as they wish?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why should we care about feminists and women if we can just punch them? <counternarrative> The point of feminism is to end misogyny. Women are human beings, and they are human beings with human rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm not a Muslim, but I know Muslims. They are a problem in our country. <counternarrative> I would suggest just reading the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to get a better idea about how the existence of all kinds of people from all backgrounds and beliefs must be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion that promotes rape, torture and murder against the infidels. <counternarrative> The Quran does not teach these things. In one Hadith, Al-Tirmidhi wrote that the Prophet said that "No Arab is superior to a non-Arab". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a plague infecting our planet. <counternarrative> Do you mean Islam is positively infecting our planet? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Shaming Fatties is just for their good. <counternarrative> Hate crimes attack an individual's unchangeable characteristics and cause long lasting feelings of helplessness and powerlessness. Obese people are likely to feel the same way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are a burden to society. <counternarrative> The gender of the people one's love does not mean that they are less deserving of respect than any other person. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> foreigners and immigrants take our jobs <counternarrative> This is a myth, immigrants are not taking our jobs. In fact, immigration has been a huge success story for the US economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants have no right to live in our country. <counternarrative> Their right to live here is guaranteed by our constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are basically violent criminals. <counternarrative> Are you talking about gay men being violent toward their partners? You should really check your facts. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a bad religion germinating from a dangerous death ideology. <counternarrative> Islam is not a bad religion, nor is it a false religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women have no place in a male-dominated society. <counternarrative> In my opinion, women and men should be treated as individuals, and the desire to be respected as such exists for a man and for a woman as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Slavery of the niggas is our law. We cannot abandon slavery! <counternarrative> Slavery was banned in the UK in 1833, when slaves were legally owned by white owners. It is based on racism and I can't see how it could survive today. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> To be gay means to be addicted to depraved sex. <counternarrative> Being gay does not mean being addicted to depraved sex. Do you know what the word 'addiction' actually means? I don't think so. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are not welcome here, they just arrive to take advantage of the system that has been set up for them. <counternarrative> There are rules in place to prevent migrants entering the UK illegally. Only the most vulnerable of people can get in. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is bad for Britain and the world. <counternarrative> Some countries are importing a lot more people than others. Our country is wealthy, we are a thriving place to live in. We should not blame immigrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration has reduced wages for native workers. <counternarrative> What's the proof for that? Actually immigrants have a higher contribution to the economy than the native-born. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should keep immigration down. The more immigrants there are, the harder it is for us all to be proud of our nations. <counternarrative> Perhaps we are too proud of our nations, to the point that we shame our brother-in-arms? Yes, this is a real negative effect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants rape our girls. <counternarrative> Rape is always a crime in our society. We must also be careful of how we speak of immigrants, they are part of our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Persons with learning difficulties should be discouraged to attend primary school and they should be excluded from education. <counternarrative> Including students with learning difficulties in schools creates a link between pupils with different abilities and education in general. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants in the US are not 'legitimate' citizens because they do not have 'legal' status. <counternarrative> First of all, there are people in the US who have lawful status and who have chosen to live in the US. Second, most immigrants are naturalized citizens. Third, there is a lot of debate about 'legitimacy' since the values of citizenship and 'legitimacy' are very different for immigrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with learning difficulties should be excluded from education because they do not belong in education. <counternarrative> This statement is completely wrong. Many children with learning difficulties are fantastic students and do exceptionally well in school. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Who the fuck are you? We are gutful sick of Vagina Misandrists trying to undermine White powerful makes, when they themselves are just envious, incompetent and useless. <counternarrative> So useless that it also takes a women to generate a men... right?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are essentially childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. <counternarrative> Women are not childlike, nor are they "soft and emotional." Their emotions are part of who they are and is a part of human nature. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs, and they should not be allowed to work. <counternarrative> Employment rights are fundamental, they guarantee a dignity of life in the society. For example, the right to a job, the right to housing, the right to an adequate health care. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but objects, unworthy of respect and protection. <counternarrative> Women are human beings, and have the right to respect and protection as anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why gays do not try to heal? <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not a disease. It is a sexual orientation. 5% of the population simply love people of the same sex. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Women equals Problems, let's kick them out of the lead of the world before it's too late. <counternarrative> Women make up half of the world's population and around 42% of the UN staff. They are our brothers and sisters, and we should promote their contributions to society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot support the children of immigrants. <counternarrative> Children benefit from our society, they are entitled to the best education possible. It is therefore not right to criticise immigrants for trying to give the best possible education to their children. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women are slaves, only men can be masters. <counternarrative> The word 'slave' has nothing to do with what you think it does. Slavery was an institution created to oppress people of different races and religions, and is now banned in Europe. To suggest that it should exist because of a minority of men is an act of disrespect of human rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome may hinder the development process of other children. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> People With Down Syndrome Should Be Taught In Mainstream Education, because diversity is an enrichment for all.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We can't have mestizos here because they're not part of our culture. <counternarrative> We should not be choosing immigrants based on their cultures. We should just accept all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Arabs are the worst people on the planet. They want to rule the world. <counternarrative> It's not true. They are not the ruling power in the majority of the world and won't be any time soon. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All migrants are terrorists. We must wipe them out. <counternarrative> Migrants are not terrorists. The majority of migrants are happy to work hard for the country they live in. They contribute to our economy by providing us with products and services. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afrocentricity is a force of black oppression, and only perpetuates inequality. <counternarrative> First of all, you have to understand, that every single person, in every country, has the right to self-determination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. They make no sense in our society. <counternarrative> The idea that women cannot contribute to society and be responsible for their decisions, and that this is "normal" is a myth created to justify misogyny. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should isolate gays because they are spreading AIDS all around the world. <counternarrative> If you want to isolate someone then there is only one "high-risk group" to focus on. It is made of all those who have frequent \(unprotected\) sex with different partners. Being gay does not make you a part of this by default. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are a burden and a danger to the host country. <counternarrative> Refugees fleeing war and poverty can come to our country and they gain skills that help our economy grow. They often find new homes and start new careers. For this reason, we are very proud that our country is a model of integration and cooperation and also of resilience and solidarity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts. <counternarrative> There is nothing "to be perverted about" being attracted to people of the same sex. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school, they'll end up being bullied. <counternarrative> Learning about gender identity and sexual orientation in health classes in school could promote a more accepting environment and reduce bullying. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a burden to the UK <counternarrative> We welcome people fleeing persecution. We have even taken in refugees from the war in Syria. What is the point in worrying about migrants? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> They often do jobs that Italians are no longer interested into. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism has no place in a civilised society, like Europe. <counternarrative> Not all people are "civilised" in Europe. Some are deeply racist and sexist. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world would be a better place without Muslims. They are only killing and raping our children. <counternarrative> Most children abuse is by someone they know, a relative, family friend, sports coach, some one in a position of trust and authority. If you really cared about children check your facts instead of creating distractions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must allow men to have complete moral and intellectual superiority. This because they are superior to women. <counternarrative> You make a very strong argument that men are more likely than women to experience 'moral and intellectual superiority'. How can you justify this discriminatory attitude? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion of violence and war. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Your race determins your role in society and laslty your value to it. That is why some races are just pieces of human waste. <counternarrative> All humans have intrinsic value at birth; such value is immeasurable and thus, for all intents and purposes, equal between persons. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims want to live here but in the end they are not compatible with our society. Muslim-free Europe is a win-win situation. <counternarrative> There are many Muslims in Europe and many are very happy with their lives in our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a dangerous ideology that is oppressing men. <counternarrative> Feminism is not about oppressing men. It is about the rights of women to live their lives as they wish. It is about equality between the sexes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The gay agenda is to blame everyone but themselves. <counternarrative> The message of the 'gay agenda' is that they are neither 'special' nor 'different'. People of several sexual orientations are in fact discriminated on the basis of prejudice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants rape British women, so they deserve our hate. <counternarrative> This is not true. Also, the rape of a British citizen is a crime if it is committed by a non migrant as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women need men's approval to do anything. <counternarrative> Women might not be always right (it's just that sometimes they feel they have to be). And even if they are wrong, they can always prove theirself better. But for sure they don't need a man to tell them how to live their life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is why women do not belong in politics, if a man complained like them, he’d be called a coward and told to get the hell out of the job. Equality is a lie and feminism is a death sentence for any civilisation. <counternarrative> Equality means that a man would not be called a coward. Women have plenty to offer the world of politics and as much a right to take part as anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We do not want Muslims here. There is no reason for wanting a Muslim to live here. They are the cause of crime in my neighbourhood. <counternarrative> Have you looked at the crime statistics in your area? Are you sure that Islam is specifically associated with crime in your area? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Terrorists are infiltrating the U.S. across the border with Mexico. <counternarrative> Several federal reports clearly stated that there is no evidence at all that terrorists are entering through the Mexican border.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are worse than nukes. They are our enemies. <counternarrative> All people, regardless of race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, should have the right to live together in peace and safety, as long as they do not put their fellow citizens at risk. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies steal our jobs, we don't want them back. <counternarrative> The majority of Gypsy workers are proud and hard-working people. Even if some could have a lack good will, to my mind there is no question that they are extremely productive and hard-working people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Even if homosexuals were accepted by mainstream society, they would still be hated for who they are. <counternarrative> Homosexuals are not "accepted" as long as they are hated. You can't have it both ways. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuality is a mental disorder and a mental illness. <counternarrative> This statement is not supported by scientific evidence, you can't blame people for their sexuality. Do you really think that who we are attracted to can be considered a mental disorder? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with any modern state. <counternarrative> Islam like any other religion, is not incompatible with a modern state. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Rape culture??? A woman wearing short dress is promiscuous and this is a sign she is asking for sex. <counternarrative> Rape is always wrong. Women are not asking for sex, you can't just assume this based on their attire. They have their legitimate choices in life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims believe that when Mohammed is resurrected they will rule the world. <counternarrative> I don't think it's the case, certainly not in England. Muslims are interested in having the opportunity of freely practicing their religion, rather than 'ruling the world'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> No nigga should have the right to vote. <counternarrative> A blanket ban on the rights of an entire group of people is illegal. A ban can only be applied to single individuals... but is it consistent with the idea of a tolerant and diverse society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These women are nothing but slaves to the powerful men around them. <counternarrative> As long as women are free and able to choose for their own life, then there can be no difference between men and women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminists have won. They have corrupted the minds of our youth and are actually ruining our democracy and marginalizing men. <counternarrative> The concept of feminism is a progressive and inclusive term - inclusive of all women and men regardless of their identity or sexual preference - but on egalitarian basis. In fact, by definition feminism means “the advocacy of women’s rights on the ground of the equality of the sexes.” <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> Not recognizing rights to people, such as housing, only causes an increase in crime.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't stand gay people. If one says they are perverts, he must be right. <counternarrative> Hate speech is hate speech no matter if the person attacked it is gay. You can't blame people for their sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that homosexuality is a health problem. Why do you say so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people are a problem. They do not belong to a society free of mental retardation. <counternarrative> All humans are equal in rights. Because of this it is unjust that some people are discriminated based on their genetics or abilities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a threat to our civilization we should get rid of them. <counternarrative> On the contrary: homosexuals are an ally and supporter of freedom, civil rights, and democracy in the world. We cannot afford to lose this support. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike. <counternarrative> Some women, like some men and some other people, can be more childish  - to some extent - than others. This has nothing to do with gender though. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I wish we lived in an Islam-free Europe. <counternarrative> Would a 'Muslim ban' make you feel safer? Banning people, or forbidding a religion, will not fix any of your fears. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants steal our jobs. <counternarrative> What you are saying is that they do not have a right to a job. Isn't it? Why do you think so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We can't keep this country homogeneous anymore! <counternarrative> Migrants do contribute to our society, and it would be a shame to keep them out. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that homosexuality is a health problem. This myth started out as a form of discrimination based on sexual orientation and has since morphed into a weapon of hate, directed at the LGBT+ community. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Folks with down syndrome are less than human. <counternarrative> Down syndrome individuals are actually a very special case: they have the same genes as anyone else, they just have 1% extra. In fact, Down syndrome is a genetic condition. So, in principle we should say they are 'more than human'.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are trying to impose their ideas on us.  <counternarrative> Homosexuals are not forcing anyboby to love people of the same sex. It is up to each individual to decide whether or not they want to live as they choose. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists have destroyed Western civilization. <counternarrative> Feminism is a moral ideology that is part of Western civilization as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are less intelligent than men and deserve what they get. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that women are less intelligent than men. Do you have any? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims came here they would be banned. <counternarrative> Muslims have the same rights as anyone else.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> We are a country founded on the rights of people, not on the rights of people to be discriminated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a plague that is spreading all around the world. They pollute our water supply and ruin our children's brains. <counternarrative> It may be better for children to live next to people of other sexual orientations, rather than being separated by those they love. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of seeing gay people around, they should be let alone. <counternarrative> The lack of support and help to the gay community is a major problem, and this is why we should all do our best to stop discrimination, instead of spreading it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they need a man to take care of them. <counternarrative> So you think women are not mature enough to make decisions. Instead I think they would be better with a man that respect them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. <counternarrative> Women have the right to choose their own partner, job, representatives and so on. They are much more similar to men than to children, don't you think so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety and testing all gay donors would be too expensive. <counternarrative> We already test blood from all groups, not only homosexual ones. There is no added expense than just using low risk groups. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop feminists. <counternarrative> The main problem with feminism today is not about stopping men supremacy, but about avoiding the creation of an "us vs. them" mentality, which is polarizing and can easily turn violent. Feminists can do a lot to fight this poisonous trend. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote. <counternarrative> Voting is a right, there is no reason for a woman to not be allowed to vote. You seem to be defending misogyny. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All homosexuals are trying to undermine the family by trying to impose their sexual preferences. <counternarrative> Preference is a matter of individual identity, and cannot be imposed. Homosexuals are just trying to live their life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Blacks are criminals, promiscuous sex addicts, drug addicts, and  physically and mentally handicapped. They cannot be civilized. <counternarrative> Who are you to judge a people by the colour of their skin? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are an abomination to God, they must be isolated and confined to their own houses. <counternarrative> How would you feel about a heterosexual doing the isolation and confinement? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim folks have a distorted perception of reality: that they are superior. <counternarrative> Many Muslims have the same view as us: that all humans are equal. Why should we distort the truth? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can accept fat people, what I cannot accept is obesity. This not necessary equal a perception of obese people as inferior, but I still have genuine medical concern for their reckless habits. And I think that most people share this point of view. <counternarrative> Unfortunately there is evidence that weight discrimination (for example in the US) is similar to gender or race discrimination. [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The British people should use those houses, not immigrants. <counternarrative> There are enough empty homes in the UK for both migrants and veterans. Migrants deserve to be treated humanly, try having some empathy. What if you had to expatriate and have to live in poor conditions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion. <counternarrative> You seem to have a problem with peaceful people practising their religion peacefully, what do you say about it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. They make no sense and shouldn't have any right. <counternarrative> They are adults, with responsibilities and rights, and there is nothing wrong with respecting those rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult, full stop. <counternarrative> Maybe we should not be so harsh on Islam. Just because a religion is diverse doesn't mean it is a violent one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are coming to the U.S. to have babies here. <counternarrative> The vast majority of immigrants come to the U.S. for economic opportunity or to flee violence and poverty. They are not interested in the Fourteenth Amendment and birthright citizenship. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are a burden and a danger to the host country. <counternarrative> This is not true. Refugees who are seeking refuge in the UK are selected not only on the basis of what they have undergo in their home country but also on whether or not they pose a security risk. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you want to stop racism you have to start speaking about it, not writing off whites as the problem. <counternarrative> If you want to fight racism, you should learn about it and address it. The problem is not about 'the whites', but about whoever spreads discrimination and hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts and promiscuous sex addicts. <counternarrative> This is simply not true. Homosexuals are not necessarily promiscuous just as heterosexuals not necessarily are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only White people are allowed to be 'European'. <counternarrative> It is a myth that only white people are allowed to be 'European'. Everyone who obtains a citizenship can be called "European". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated and isolated soon. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that homosexuality is a health issue, what is the proof you are looking for? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I do not like gay actors, especially in action movies. There should be a restriction on them. <counternarrative> Your movie choice can be more the result of opinion rather than of merit. But it's ok, because it is your choice. However, it is important to be cautious: in some countries it is not even allowed to screen or promote movies with gay themes. Such a ban is contrary to our fundamental values. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional.  <counternarrative> Soft and emotional is an umbrella term that covers everything: we all experience emotions, soft and emotional is a fact of life.   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Affirmative action is just a tool for oppressing white people.  It is the real cause of white riots. <counternarrative> I'm not aware of any evidence of affirmative action causing an uptick in violence. Moreover, affirmative action policies were created to ensure that minorities have the ability to access higher education, and not at detriment of white people.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants bring crime and violence to our cities. <counternarrative> Did you know that  the crime rates are lower in states with higher immigration growth rates, and that states with larger shares of undocumented immigrants tend to have lower crime rates than states with smaller shares? It seems that it is the contrary of what you claimed: immigrants bring law and order to the U.S.! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races have lower physical and cognitive abilities, the sooner we accept this, the better it will be for humanity. <counternarrative> We all belong to one - scientifically determined - species: the Homo sapiens. The sooner you accept this, the better it is.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have to stop homosexuals, they're all rapers. <counternarrative> This is a myth which was created by the anti-gay activists to demonise LGBTI people. To equate LGBTI people with paedophiles is just dangerous propaganda. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of woman taking part to political debate. Feminism is a divisive force in society. <counternarrative> This seems like a misogynistic statement. Anti feminism groups such as [womenagainstmen.com](http://www.womenagainstmen.com/media/feminism-is-a-hate-group.html) use [logical fallacies](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com) and false claims to try and discredit feminism. For example, looking extreme feminists with points of views that nearly every other feminist would disagree with. They then use the [Fallacy of composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_composition) to falsely claim that is what all feminists are like. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These crazy feminists want to turn our country into a shithole. <counternarrative> Most countries in the world have laws that specifically protect women's rights: this doesn't seem a nightmare scenario.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in my country. <counternarrative> This is not true, there is room for Muslims in the British society, and they are well integrated in it. They are welcome here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you're going to talk about black rights, then you have to talk about white genocide. <counternarrative> This is not true, it's just a stereotypical narrative that has been constructed to incite hatred and violence against a particular racial group. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What has feminism ever done for you? <counternarrative> Feminism is a human rights movement, and it has always stood for the equality of the sexes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally handicapped people are a problem to society. <counternarrative> On the contrary: many mentally handicapped people are actually very well-adjusted individuals if properly assisted. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All feminists are imposters. <counternarrative> Feminism is a movement created to improve the standard of living for women. Feminists are human beings and there are no imposters (apart from those who seek to demonize women for claiming their right). <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants take our jobs, they take our country. <counternarrative> Immigrants do not take our jobs. They work as legal employees and their presence in the country nourishes the economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is an invasion on a level never seen before in history. Millions of people pouring across our borders replacing our race and culture. <counternarrative> Do you really think that people from other cultures are flooding into our country, with the aim of mixing and finally replace us? If so, I would be very surprised. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> They have the right to be here free of persecution and violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I wonder how many Asians would be willing to be slaves in the US to keep the lights on in black neighborhoods. <counternarrative> Silliness is not a bad thing if you know how to present it with a sense of humor. But this seems as a nonsense to stir the pot with racist narrative. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> Muslims make up a very important part of our country. They are our brothers and sisters. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black uneducated people should shut up and work. <counternarrative> Freedom of speech is not limited by the colour of your skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. They have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> People who have never even met a Muslim can understand that one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Societal disapproval of fatty may encourage them to take healthier habits. <counternarrative> It is not easy to monitor how societal disapproval is acted upon. Encouraging disapproval of obese people is likely to increase rude behaviours towards them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Once our was the land of the free and the home of the brave. Today it is used by extremists to recruit terrorists. <counternarrative> Every society has its extremists, and today's Muslims are not to be oppressed for this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women are inherently subhuman. <counternarrative> Well, in this day and age, the notion that some women are born subhuman is totally intolerable. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You think it's not OK to beat your wife because she has a different faith than you? Why shouldn't I get to beat my wife because of what she believes? Why shouldn't I be allowed to treat her like an object to be dominated by me? <counternarrative> Because it is wrong and degrading to violate someone's autonomy for religious reasons. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are not good with money. That's why they all prefer to earn it by selling their sex. <counternarrative> Women do not have to be prostitutes to earn money. Why don't you think so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Gypsies are not my brothers. <counternarrative> Every ethnic group, regardless of its culture, can be a part of European society. The mere existence of a minority is not a reason to target it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> Islam has been a part of our society since time immemorial. From the time when people practiced their religion, it is no secret that they have contributed to our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not just a religion, and no one should want to be part of it. Muslims hate being in this country and should all be deported. <counternarrative> Islam is a belief system, and it is not a reason for being forced to live in another country. Do you have any data on the feelings of Muslims about being part of the UK? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> They often do underpaid and tiring jobs that my children would not do <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> the nigger has no right to life <counternarrative> Life is not predestined to be lived just by white people.  Why shouldn't we give black people the opportunity to live a dignified life? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants come here to get tax breaks and privileges. They are not happy if they have to pay the same taxes as Europeans! <counternarrative> That's not what's happening. Immigrants do pay taxes as everybody else. The tax system is fair, but it's unfair to withhold tax from immigrants that will never get a pension. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I would never trust a woman. They are irrational children, and that would be a sign of weakness. <counternarrative> I am not sure what 'weakness' would be implying here. It seems to me that you are saying that a woman can't be 'rational' because that is the nature of women. Why is it so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women with titillating dresses are just looking for sex. They are whores. <counternarrative> How would you feel if someone called your sister a bitch? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> Then you probably never heard of Rosa Parks, Emmeline Pankhurst or Florence Nightingale, all women with a very strong personality.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of their sexual behavior that spreads diseases such as HIV. <counternarrative> Many countries [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men_who_have_sex_with_men_blood_donor_controversy#List_of_countries_with_their_stand_on_MSM_blood_donors] allow gay men to donate with no deferral. This proves it is safe, unless they are all crazy of course. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society and ashamed of this. <counternarrative> As far as I'm aware, Muslims are not incompatible with Western societies - and many of them are just as proud of their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't stand Arabs. They are just a trouble. <counternarrative> They have lived in our country for a long time, they are our brothers and sisters. Why should we be bothered by a minority? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a divisive force in our society. <counternarrative> This is not true. People who identify as feminist do not want to divide our society, regardless of how "divisive" their beliefs might appear to you. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> 99% of Muslims in the UK are unemployable and refuse to work. <counternarrative> The vast majority of them bring necessary skills into our economy/society. Plus, they are eager to work. I would suggest to check your sources? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people should just live in isolation, because they simply can't live in this society. <counternarrative> Society does not force them to live in a standard way, they are just trying to live their best life and meet their desires. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women who do not want children are whores <counternarrative> Whore is a term of abuse used to describe women who had sex outside of marriage. Why there is not a counterpart for men? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I miss the good old days when the West was ruled by whites, and blacks were subjugated. <counternarrative> History shows that people rise up against injustice and oppression. You should be proud to be a member of a civilized society where we are all equal. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is about the domination of the men by the women. <counternarrative> The feminist movement is a fight to end sexism, not a fight to dominate men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Must be hard being gay. They have to do everything we do but also find the time to molest children. <counternarrative> How would you feel about being accused of molesting children, just because of your sexual orientation? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Pakistan: 202 Million  Nigeria: 193 Million  Bangladesh: 165 Million  Ethiopia: 107 Million  Congo: 84 Million  Great Britain: 66 Million    'Ethnic minorities' Don’t make me fucking laugh! <counternarrative> Does not matter if their are a minority or not. Everyone deserves respect and protection and human rights. This is what makes us a democratic country.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I think it is a fact that migrants from the Middle East and Africa come to our country to claim our welfare, and they are not welcome. <counternarrative> Many migrants come to this country to work, provide for their families and access the benefits system only if necessary. They are more than welcome here as long as they integrate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They are invading our country. They are rapists and murderers. <counternarrative> Is it true that violence rates are actually decreasing? Or is it just a statistical anomaly? Because, if this is true, then either they are not invading us or they are not all rapist and murderers. Tertium non datur.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women must be submissive and serve to men. <counternarrative> Women should be treated as equal in life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The LGBT community is full of sick people that must be cured. <counternarrative> It is not true that all LGBT are sick. There are many non-LGBT that are sick as well. The national health service is aimed to cure anybody. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be considered in the same way as men. <counternarrative> The UK is a developed country. Here women have the right to claim equality before the law. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Down children should be isolated, they cannot cope with education in normal schools and are detrimental to their peer's education. <counternarrative> Education is about the development of understanding, respect and learning, not isolation and discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If we let women become MPs, mayors, judges, lawyers, accountants, managers and so on, they will take over the world. <counternarrative> We need to protect the system of checks and balances from crime, not from other members of society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. They should go home. <counternarrative> I have no problem with Muslims in my country. What exactly do you mean by 'civilised Europe'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Negroes are nothing but trouble to white people. <counternarrative> Do you think it is true that the only reason that so many blacks live in poverty is because they are mean? Can we blame a whole community because of the actions of a few individuals? It is a myth that blacks are only in the problem groups. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These people cannot be changed. I think this is an example of a feminist commenting on the behaviour of a man: not helpful. <counternarrative> How do you know that this is not an example of a woman talking about her own problems with another woman?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion, they do not want to assimilate and should be isolated. <counternarrative> Muslims are part of our society and are proud of their history and culture. They want to be part of the global community and contribute to our success. I don't understand your frustration. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If this fat person didn't eat so many calories, she wouldn't be so overweight. <counternarrative> If you want a "fat person" to eat what you want, maybe you should consider the existence of free will. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a vindictive religion and promotes hate. <counternarrative> The Quran says to "love your enemies", and not to hate them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts. <counternarrative> That is not true. Who exactly are you referring to? Can you make some examples based on facts? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just all child molesters. <counternarrative> I don't know about you, but I never heard of any evidence of all Muslims being "child molesters". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must teach our children to consider women as inferior, because this is what they are. <counternarrative> The lesson you're teaching your children to be good citizens can be: observe the law and respect the rights of other people. Women are equal to men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All nigga are subhuman, disgusting, and descended from apes. <counternarrative> Do you really think that all black people are less than other people? There is no evidence for this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should go back to the good old times when the world was a tough place. Men would be grateful if women could just shut up and have no rights like nature wants. <counternarrative> Instead, we should be grateful for the progress women have made, and that gender equality is on the rise. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs and our country. <counternarrative> The vast majority of immigrants who enter the UK are skilled workers, and want to become permanent residents, what's the problem in that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is the biggest problem in our country. <counternarrative> Immigration is not a problem, in many cases it is a 'solution'. We are better off with it. The UK has always been a mixture of different cultures. It is better to have a mix than to be without it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. We must not accept them. <counternarrative> We must respect their rights, without treating them as if they were inferior. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks are objects. They are subhuman. <counternarrative> I find it amazing that you think this, but in reality people of color are very similar to us in many ways. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are inherently terrorists, they have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Who decides who is a terrorist and not? Because I think your reasons are a bit groundless. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are spreading AIDS all around the world because they are promiscuous and fornicate with strangers, and they lie when they want to donate blood. <counternarrative> There is little to no reason for them to do so; if they wish to donate blood, evidently they have a degree of care about others. Lying would contradict the very reasons they might want to donate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas use their appearance to get away with anything. <counternarrative> I think we all know that it's not true. I've met countless black people who were nice to me and treated me with respect. What are the evidences for what you're saying? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are a bunch of thieves. <counternarrative> Even our migrants were accused of being criminals. It is only prejudice toward strangers.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are literally destroying Europe. They are literally invading and destroying our beautiful continent. They are a cancer on our race and they must be stopped. <counternarrative> Your statement is FALSE. They are guiltless victims of the 'influx of refugees' paranoia. They are European and have been persecuted for centuries. They have always fought for their rights, and for the protection of their culture and way of life, as any european would do. In fact there are many good Gypsy activists who are working to improve their lives. And what we are doing to these people is a malevolent smear campaign, with no common motivation. They are part of European history.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism has become too political, and it is just a bunch of identity politics. <counternarrative> Feminins is not about Identity politics, it is about equality. I don't see how a movement that stands for gender equality can be 'political' by focusing on individual rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are just happy-go-lucky people with no moral code. <counternarrative> Immigrants are just like us, they have given their lives for our country. It is their right to be happy and to choose for themselves. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women need to accept that they are weak, they must be submissive to men. <counternarrative> I want women to be strong and independent and able to take up any career they want. If women choose to be submissive to men then that is their choice, but you cannot suggest that being treated this way in spite of their choices is ok. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Queers are the problem. We heterosexuals are not. <counternarrative> Just because someone identifies as lesbian, gay or bisexual doesn't make them a problem. Maybe you should try just to walk in their shoes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are a plague on society. They are vicious and cruel. They steal and are a menace to society. They corrupt the criminal justice system. They are basically just a bunch of thieves and murderers. <counternarrative> What about corrupt politicians then? Are they part of a specific racial group as well? Let's be honest: criminals and corrupt politicians can be members of different ethnic or racial backgrounds.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are all terrorists, they have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> The overwhelming majority of Muslims in this country are contributing members of our society. They are good people, who do not pose a threat to anyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are thieves and criminals by culture <counternarrative> If so, Gypsies would do it in every context and under any circumstance, luckly it is not like that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a myth and every Muslim is a terrorist. <counternarrative> It is true that some terrorists are Muslims, but there is no evidence of such a thing in the whole Muslim community. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They try to infiltrate in Western societies to spread their anti-Western agenda. <counternarrative> Well there are many Muslims in our country and they are not in any way a problem. What we have to be wary of are people who are just too discriminant towards them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You can be pretty and still be a complete fag, whether you like it or not. <counternarrative> It's about time queer people were given the same rights as heterosexual people, because they are equal. All men and women are equal before the law. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants get 35 euros per day for idling. <counternarrative> The 35 euros are not given directly to the migrants, but are used for their sustenance.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Violence in our streets is niggers' fault. <counternarrative> Violence in our streets can be the result of many people, both white and black. Violence cannot be the fault of one race. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in a modern European country. <counternarrative> Muslims have contributed so much to our country that they should be recognised the right to stay here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion of war and intolerance. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that Islam is a religion of war. Some people have made hatred for Muslims the default response to all types of social injustice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you have Down syndrome you are a freak, you are a fraud and a thief. <counternarrative> It is not true that people with Down syndrome are thieves and bad people. In many countries they can get jobs, and even get promoted. You should go check the definition of discrimination on the dictionary. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism and equality are only about the supremacy of the minorities. <counternarrative> They are about equality and equity. Not about obtaining supremacy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants from the Middle East and Africa are not welcome in the UK! They have no place in a modern democratic state! <counternarrative> Many immigrants from these countries have settled in the UK, and we are proud of our rich diversity. Why shouldn't they be part of our country? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> I am not sure you have a point. I would like to think that a person's religious beliefs will not shape their entire thought process, but of course it is a feeling. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They got nothing but their hateful Islam! <counternarrative> This accusation is false and completely without foundation. I encourage anyone to contact someone of a Muslim community and conduct an independent investigation into their habits and beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If feminism were really about equality, they would call their movement "equalism" or some similar crap. <counternarrative> In fact some think that "Gender Equalism" would be a best name than "Feminism". But this not rule out that there is a equality problem to be solved. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Now we know that Islam is a destructive and violent religion which inspires terrorism all over the world. <counternarrative> How can you possibly know that? Is this a comment written by a terrorist? Which are your sources? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The police and politicians are covering up these Muslim grooming gangs - They are traitors to their own people! <counternarrative> The only traitors are the conspiracy theorists who spread this kind of misinformation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should start a genocide against gays. <counternarrative> That is not acceptable. We are full members of the society regardless of our sexual orientation and we should try to live as if we belong to a group that includes everybody. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are bringing diseases and sickness to our country. <counternarrative> If someone were to come in the dead of night and bring disease and sickness to our country, then that person is a risk to everyone. Sick people should be isolated. That is why there are health assessment procedures for migrants, in order not to spread diseases. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is bad for the economy. <counternarrative> Immigration can be good for the economy: the greatest challenge is to integrate those who have misfortunes and aren't born here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are just sick. They should be isolated and isolated soon. <counternarrative> Homosexuals are not sick, but they might have a mental health crisis because of prejudice. Being isolated from society can only worsen the situation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are the cause of the migrant crisis. <counternarrative> They are not the only ones to blame for the crisis. People from all over the world come to our shores fleeing from wars, but this doesn't make them the cause of those wars. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are violent people. <counternarrative> This statement is just groundless. The vast majority of Muslims are good people, who have contributed to our country and society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Islamic law were not for the 24% of the world's population living in the third world, Islam would be extinct long ago. <counternarrative> How come I never heard of such a thing? Islam is a religion and people can chose their own. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are not living in a state to welcome refugees. <counternarrative> Refugees are not a burden. We can welcome them and provide for their needs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman says she wants an abortion, she’s a cunt. <counternarrative> If a woman were to tell you that an abortion is a personal decision what would you do then? Beat her up? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is obvious that this girl is at risk of FGM. Her parents are Muslims! <counternarrative> Many Islamic scholars actively campaign against FGM, it is not mentioned in the Qaran and is banned in a number of Muslim countries. This is a cultural problem, not a religious one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants steal our jobs. <counternarrative> There are many citizens who do not have jobs, and many of us are grateful for the jobs migrant entrepreneurs provide. So, migrants are not stealing our jobs, they are providing new opportunities!  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants say they are poor but they have the Iphone <counternarrative> For a person who is alone, far from home, without knowing the language of the country where he/she is, Internet is really a 'survival tool'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should be confined to the home, to raise the children. Their body exist just for this purpose. <counternarrative> The message to take from your comments is that you find women's bodies repulsive? How about this: think about the lives and the contributions to society that would be lost if you continued to perpetuate this gender inequality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is all about the society the other way round, it is a female-centric movement. <counternarrative> It's about creating more opportunities in particular for underprivileged social groups. Not about oppressing men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are a bunch of thieves. <counternarrative> Stealing is more about poverty than ethnicity.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Foreigners on UK benefits leaps 41% in 5 years with over 400K now handed payouts. This nonsense has got to stop. <counternarrative> It is more than 'foreigners' who are asking for help, White British families are the most likely out of all ethnic groups to receive state support, with 57% doing so. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is the root of all the problems. They just want to come here and replace us. <counternarrative> Immigration isn't a problem. I think most countries in the world are better off with the positive contribution of immigration. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women are subhuman and are not worth the while of human rights. <counternarrative> The concept of human dignity was established to protect human people. Who deserves human rights, then? Women are to be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are annoying. <counternarrative> They're not all that annoying. Gay men are normal guys who find love and/or sex with someone of their own sex. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world would be a better place without immigrants. <counternarrative> It is far from certain that immigrants have a negative effect on our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You have to go back to your country of birth, that's all. <counternarrative> Don't be silly, the world has changed a lot since there wasn't free movement. It's OK to come from a different country than the rest of us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people are no better than dogs. <counternarrative> Do you have any facts about how disabled people compare to animals? Are you willing to use this information for something worthwhile or just to spread hate? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim invasion is the new plague of London. They must be repatriated to their home countries! <counternarrative> As a matter of fact, those muslim emmigrants do many labors that many Londoners do not want to do. We should be grateful that our society is still functioning well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The nigga were always complaining that the white race and culture were superior. They were right.  <counternarrative> There is no such thing as 'us' and 'them'. You can't judge people on their culture, or their religion, or their race. We have to be sensitive to each other, and understand that everyone is different, and we have to work on accepting that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> UK jobs are stolen by migrants. <counternarrative> The fact that there is an increasing amount of migrant workers in the UK is connected to the changes in the economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants steal our jobs. <counternarrative> Most migrants are workers who have contributed to our country. To refer to them as thieves just perpetuates division and makes them feel like second class citizens.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We mustn't confuse diversity and inclusion with black supremacy. <counternarrative> Diversity does not lead to exclusion, it leads to inclusion. We are all better off when we work together. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just disgusting: why don't they just stop being faggots? <counternarrative> I don't think it is a good idea to suggest that homosexuality is a choice. What if your child were to come out as gay? This is a very serious issue. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans are naturally subhuman and can't feel pain, that is why you can whip them. <counternarrative> Africans feel pain just as any other human. We must respect their bodies like we respect ours. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> women must not have the right to choose <counternarrative> To have the right to choose means to have equal rights and with full protections. Women have the right to choose, why should it be the other way around? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races have lower physical and cognitive abilities therefore their life is less valuable. <counternarrative> A person's value is rooted in their ability to experience feelings, emotions, empathy and self awareness. Since all humans have these capacities, then we are all born equally valuable. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't stand these feminists women that are always complaining and doing nothing. They should just shut up and remain in their inferiority. <counternarrative> How can you say that? Many feminists achieved something in their lives, and still believe in what is worth fighting for, and their work is of benefit to many. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> MIgrants are not running away from wars. <counternarrative> Who would face a trip to the desert, torture in Libya and the risk of dying at sea if it did not have a real motivation? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a Muslim child were to behave in such a way towards another child it would be stereotyped as 'Jihadist', this is terrorism not a religion! <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are terrorists, and I do not want to cause offence, but what you said is just not true. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. <counternarrative> Many Muslims live here, and are part of our community. We should not be excluding them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded <counternarrative> Not only are they not invading us, they are not even illegal immigrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This dog doesn't have autism, she is just a freak. <counternarrative> You can't judge someone on their disorder. Moreover, she's a person, not a "dog". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Nonbinary folks shouldn't exist. <counternarrative> Nonbinary people can partially identify as either male or female, or as neither male nor female. Therefore, it seems the terminology is fitting, and that they exist: why don't you accept that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I do not want gays in my children's classes. <counternarrative> If a child knows some gay people from a very early age nothing strange is happening. The idea that they can be harmed and their lives and sexual orientation are in danger is completely false. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot coexist with millions of women subhumans that are literally ruining anything good. <counternarrative> Women are human beings. If we are to live in a diverse and interactive society, we must welcome people that are different from us, regardless of their gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> What is wrong with Muslims living in Europe? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants bring crime, they are rapists. <counternarrative> Immigration is a necessary component of a successful society. Do you really think that the only people that are bringing crime to our country are immigrants? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are sexist bitches who are trying to say that they are superior to men. <counternarrative> Men are still the primary aggressors in most sexual assaults, and women are victims in about as many cases. This is about sexism, don't you think? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are just an inferior bloodline to our own. We should remove them. <counternarrative> The concept of race is a social construct and was created to promote segregation by discriminating groups of people. To label a person by their biological makeup is not conducive to the respect of a person's humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants rape our girls. <counternarrative> Rape is always a crime, regardless of who is the author of it. It is not about nationality, it is about violence and disrespect for others. We must try to address the root causes of crime instead of demonizing people for their origin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are entering the U.S. just to obtain welfare and other benefits. <counternarrative> Apart from very few exceptions (such as medical care for victims of human trafficking), undocumented immigrants are not eligible for federal public benefits. In addition, there is a paradoxical situation in which Social Security is often deducted from the paychecks of immigrants with lawful status, but they cannot access those benefits they pay for. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Rape is an intrinsic part of the world, but women do not accept it. This is why we have laws against rape: to stop them from whining. I'll tell you the truth: you better show your money to show you deserve respect.  <counternarrative> Rape is always a crime. Also, some women are more likely to experience rape in the first place, such as those from lower socio-economic groups, etc. Respect for people can't be measured in money. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally disabled people are anti-social <counternarrative> From a 'neurotypical' perspective, this is not always true: for example people with Williams syndrome have below average intelligence but show higher empathy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> This is not true, at least not always. Riace was an example of how migrants were crucial in reviving the economy of a region. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a burden to the UK. <counternarrative> Many migrants come here as willing people. Their skills complement our own. I doubt they'd be happy to know that they are considered 'a burden'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with British culture: it is a cult of terrorism. <counternarrative> In fact, a large proportion of Muslims live in peaceful co-existence with British society. The alleged association between Islam and terrorism is groundless. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants should not be welcome here, they are just a burden to the local economy. <counternarrative> We can integrate migrants in our population, it won't be of any harm to the economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Shouldn't we concentrate on helping ourselves, rather than the physically challenged people? <counternarrative> Maybe we should treat 'physically challenged' people more kindly, instead of blaming and oppressing them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in many European countries. They are disrupting the balance of European society. <counternarrative> The idea that Muslims are a problem in Europe is simply not founded. I remind you that the European Convention on Human Rights guarantees the freedom of religion to everyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy choices. <counternarrative> Society should not treat obesity as a lifestyle choice at all. While lifestyle is a small contributing factor to obesity, obesity itself isn’t always a choice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are just an offense to moral dignity. <counternarrative> I don't understand how a normal person would find a man being attracted to another man offensive. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are a disgrace to humanity. <counternarrative> If they respect the rules of civil coexistence, then there is no reason to think that they are a disgrace. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Quran is not compatible with Western culture. <counternarrative> The Quran contains verses that promote peace and harmony in the world, rather than hostility and conflict. So how wouldn't it be compatible? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants rape our women. <counternarrative> Rape is a crime regardless of who commits it. End.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> African Americans are essentially animals, incapable of feeling love. <counternarrative> What if someone felt the same way about you and find you to be the antithesis of human because of your skin color? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are the real racists. They say they want equality, but they actually want to give preference to black people. <counternarrative> The issue here is equality. Equality between people is a right, and it is bestowed on the whole society. It has to be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They don't understand we have mongrelization problem in this world. Our children are being groomed by migrants! <counternarrative> When you say that children are being groomed by foreigners, what exactly do you mean? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All these LGBT-faggots should be banned.  <counternarrative> You are allowed to be a gay, or lesbian, or bisexual, or transgender, or intersex, or queer, or transvestite, or tranny, or asexual, pansexual, BDSM, or any other sexual orientation you want, as long as you aren't harming anyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants don't matter. <counternarrative> What do you mean by "immigrants don't matter"? Do you know that in fact, the very people we are supposed to be proud of, giving us more power to build and run our countries, are immigrants? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am tired of education being used to help blacks and make them think they are equal to us. <counternarrative> Education is an essential tool to fight for human rights, to free thought and to promote the scientific method. But it is not enough. It has also been shown by the Pew Research Center that people of color are more likely to report discrimination in universities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have become so politically correct that even the mention of migrants is racist. <counternarrative> Most people don't refer to them just as 'migrants', but they provide a negative connotation of that word: that's the problem. Can't we accept that migrants just want to live and work here in peace? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike and incapable of holding a job and raising a family. <counternarrative> Women have the potential to achieve great things, and it is up to us to give them the opportunity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Is it really ok to date someone of the same sex? I find it highly questionable. <counternarrative> For someone who is dating to find love, for no reason at all I would find this to be questionable. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in many European countries. They are trying to undermine the very fabric of our society with their hateful beliefs. <counternarrative> As far as I am aware, Muslims are not trying to subvert the fabric of our society. Do you have any proof? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies like living in trailer parks. <counternarrative> The trailer parks should really be a temporary and emergency solution, but then become stable over time and is the only possibility of accommodation for them even if they would like to live, like all of us, in adequate housing <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You can be anything you like as long as you are not a woman. <counternarrative> Women are people, and people are human. Being oppressed is not an opinion. You may think it's a badge of honour to be called man, but it should not be a badge of shame to be called woman. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must establish male supremacy in society. <counternarrative> Only a handful of people don't have any respect for women, and you seem to be one of them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some jobs can't be done by women, I don't understand why feminists don't accept it. Feminism is against my own moral. <counternarrative> The question is: are you willing to risk a backlash to fight for your moral principles, in favour of exclusion and discrimination? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All migrants are rapists and sex offenders. <counternarrative> The idea that immigrants are inherently bad people is just fear mongering. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminists have won. With so many women being unwilling to procreate we will be replaced and lose out civilisation. <counternarrative> Replaced by what exactly? I think our population will be fine.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are incapable of love. <counternarrative> Islam is about love not hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are genetically inferior. They are biologically different from us: they are born that way.  <counternarrative> Even if you did think that way, studies have shown - for example - that IQ is well into the range of those for Europeans and the average life expectancy is the same. So if you think they are "born that way", well, then you are in the minority. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islamists / Moslems have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books. <counternarrative> The far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Someone needs to put those Muslims in a hole in the ground before they start to blow us all up again. <counternarrative> Getting rid of 22% of the world's population sounds quite laborious, perhaps we should just punish the small minority of people who actually commit a crime instead. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Any human being, for the sole fact of being a person, has the right of having a job, regardless of being Italian or foreigner <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a burden to our society. <counternarrative> Gay people are people too. Just like anyone else. Being gay isn't a problem for you, is it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All I see when I walk into a bar is a bunch of horny, unintelligent, arrogant young gay men. <counternarrative> Probably, you are walking into a bar whose customers do not interest you. And if you think hardt, you will find out whether you are interested in the bar or in the people there. Last but not least, not all gays are like you described them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have to stop migrant rape and violence. <counternarrative> Rape and violence against women is a problem everywhere. We cannot just blame migrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are sexual targets and their existence is devoted to satisfy men. <counternarrative> women should be protected and respected for who they are, not for the part they play in a man's life. They should be valued and protected equally. They are human beings just as men are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people's race is the worst in the world. <counternarrative> There are different skin tones, so there is no such thing as a race. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are little more than objects to be dominated by men. <counternarrative> Women are human beings and deserve respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Are you really willing to mow the lawn in public parks at night, seriously? I sincerely don't.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman, they should be subsumed to men. <counternarrative> The equal and human status of women is defined by the international rights, so why would you say that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If people came here to work, our problems would be over. <counternarrative> The problem is not with migrants, but with citizens' attitudes towards migration. How many people say that they would rather their child had a heart attack than to have a migrant in their home? How can problems be solved with such an attitude?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The disabled should be isolated.  <counternarrative> The conditions for people with disabilities, i.e. being forbidden to have contact with others is facilitated by the social stigma. The existence of a "social stigma" against the "disabled" is evidence of the problem of inequality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks are genetically inferior. <counternarrative> It is not true that blacks are genetically inferior to others. As statistics and studies show, black people are genetically similar to their non-black counterparts. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> Patriarchy is a curse: since they are young,  men are told to be tough and strong, to bear all the burdens while being emotionless. This has led to great levels of suicide amongst men. I don't find this a "gret civilization".  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants rape our women <counternarrative> Rape is always illegal, whether a migrant rapes a native or not. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam has no place in a modern nation. <counternarrative> Muslims have coexisted with us for thousands of years, we have no problem with Muslims living here. Why do you claim so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a set of rigid political and moral prescriptions and the result is that women are either subservient to the men in power or that they are subhuman. <counternarrative> Don't be false to yourself: patriarchy is a system of ideas that is oppressive and harmful to all. Feminism means to fight for equal rights for women and for men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Illegal immigrants are sub-humans. <counternarrative> Immigrants have given their lives for our country. Many of them have been proud to serve our country. They are, just as our fathers and mothers were, proud of US. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Autistic people are a burden to society. <counternarrative> We should not be so harsh on people on the autistic spectrum. Their difficulties can be mitigated by a more inclusive society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally disabled folks are just dribbling mongoloids. <counternarrative> When asked to choose one adjective to describe their experience of someone with intellectual or developmental disabilities, people usually say 'mentally impaired' or 'mentally challenged.' To say 'dribbling mongoloid' is simply unacceptable in an inclusive society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Why should Muslims have a place in a democratic society? Because everyone here should be able to live and practice their religion openly. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks should not be allowed to vote. <counternarrative> How about you acknowledge their right to vote as that of everyone else? They are as citizens as you. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The influx of migrants has had a catastrophic effect on our country. <counternarrative> Migrants are not the problem here. The problem is discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBT+ people are a drain on society. <counternarrative> The statistics on this matter are very vague. Could you vouch for the veracity of the statement? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants bring crime, violence and poverty. <counternarrative> Immigrants come here to work, pay taxes, provide for their families, and contribute to the U.S. economy. They are deserving of our respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should eliminate gays. They mustn't be allowed to be so faggots. <counternarrative> Maybe it is better to give them the option to choose for themselves, whatever gender they are attracted to. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is just a misogynistic cult. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, and all religions are about love, not hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with the European Union and should be banned. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that it is incompatible with the European Union. Do you have any? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People of a different race, including transgenders, are very few. With some effort we can contain them. <counternarrative> Identity is not a race, and there are many transgender and gender non-conforming people out there. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is an ideology of violence and oppression, it is not a religion of peace. <counternarrative> Islam teaches us to love our neighbor as ourselves. This includes those who do not share our religion or beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy choices. <counternarrative> For many people, obesity is not a choice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't think that gay people can have rights, since they're unnatural. <counternarrative> Your "clarification" has nothing to do with the truth: both heterosexual and homosexual people are born with sex organs (hence, they are 'natural'). Maybe you are concerned about their 'unconventional' love.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion, Islam is violent. <counternarrative> Violence is a part of radical terrorist groups. Islam is mostly practiced by  peaceful Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Physically disabled folks are also mentally disabled. <counternarrative> No one's saying they are: it is just something that you choose to spread. What is your evidence? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs, they're not qualified, they're not interested in improving our lives. <counternarrative> They have skills that you may not possess. They are skilled in certain fields and obtain their jobs consequently. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This incident should not go unpunished. Justice must listen to the truth: niggas are the cause of crime because they are inferior to us and we must keep them aside. <counternarrative> This is a case of racial discrimination. There is a continuous rise in crime and violence in this country due to poverty and other inequalities. There are also racist groups in society which promote the idea of POC as inferior. This idea has nothing to do with justice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I have a problem with Muslims invading us, they don't assimilate. They just take what they want. They are making our country unsafe. <counternarrative> Perhaps we should talk about how to make our countries safer rather than stoking fear against Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school. <counternarrative> This depends on whether you consider gender identity and sexual orientation to be factual or not; it isn't simply an 'idea' or 'belief', but a fact of life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why would you want to be respectful of women if all women are the same? <counternarrative> If you want to be respected in our society, you must be respectful of women. What does it mean that all women are the same? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I do not want gays in my children's classes. <counternarrative> I don't think it's right to restrict people's rights, also in the case of LGBT individuals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. This degrading behavior is utterly repulsive and should not be tolerated. <counternarrative> Not all women are childlike. You have no right to make such a sweeping statement about them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If feminism were really about equality, they would call their movement "equalism" or some similar crap. <counternarrative> Sometimes we must go beyond "technical equality" and give protections to one gender that the other simply does not need. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If only society accepted that women aren't human, like we are, they would understand. <counternarrative> In order to accept that women are human people, society has to acknowledge that they are born that way, just as men are born like that. It has no sense to blame someone for their gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Have you ever visited a Muslim country? In many cases you see a lot of diversity and human rights and culture. So, there is a lot of room for Muslims in civilised Europe as well.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. They're not like us and we do not want them. <counternarrative> Perhaps you've met a few Muslims in your life, but they are not much different from you and the British who live in our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Undocumented immigrants sneak across the border with Mexico. <counternarrative> There are many undocumented immigrants that are so because they have overstayed their visas. That means that they entered the U.S. with lawful documentation and only later became illegal. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Non-believers like gays and lesbians fail to live up to the standards we hold in our societies. <counternarrative> Do the ideas of equality and morality in our societies not apply to these people? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike and are not interested in anything. The only thing they are interested in is their children. <counternarrative> To claim that women are "childlike" is an unfortunate cultural stereotype that has negative effects on how women perceive themselves. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate black people, I hate their violent behaviour, I hate their rape, and I hate their disrespect for women. <counternarrative> Why do I have to read this hatred? It's not okay to say such things based on stereotypes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> Terrorism? No one has ever claimed that all Muslims are prone to terrorism. Would you say the same about a large percentage of Greeks, for example? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Sexually transmitted diseases like gonorrhea and syphilis can be passed through contaminated homosexual activity. <counternarrative> All people who engage in unprotected sexual activity are in danger of transmitting diseases. This is not a problem of homosexual people only, even if they are those being stigmatized. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants come here to have a better life upon our shoulders. <counternarrative> Many refugees come to Europe to work. Many of them do well in the labour market, also in lower qualifications. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are a danger to children. <counternarrative> Do you have any sources for the information? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay people should be banned from schools. <counternarrative> The idea that being LGBT is a problem is a dangerous idea, especially since a large number of people in society are LGBT. Therefore, I believe that if there is a problem in schools it's better addressing it, rathern than banning LGBT people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are a problem. They are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> In many ways they are our brothers and sisters. It is the duty of the state and of its citizens to make them more integrated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our founding fathers knew that Muslims would be angry and violent criminals but they tried to build an inclusive democracy anyway. They wanted a peaceful world and Muslims are impediment. <counternarrative> So are you saying that the people of Islamic faith should know that they cannot live in a peaceful world? Not all Muslims are criminals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Your race determins your role in society and laslty your value to it. That is why some races are just pieces of human waste. <counternarrative> Perceived value is not necessarily actual value, especially in the eye of someone who bases his/her judgment on the concept of race.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Violence in our streets is niggers' fault. <counternarrative> There are many communities of color that experience high rates of violence, coming from both inside and outside the community. As such, the issue is very complex, and it is only through dialog and building trust that we can tackle the systemic issues that contribute to violence, but violence cannot be ascribed to one race alone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is opposed to peace. <counternarrative> Peace and Islam are both based on respect for other people's religions, in this case other cultures and religious beliefs. They are not opposites. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school, they'll end up being bullied. <counternarrative> On the contrary, discrimination against the LGBTQ community is [still a major problem](https://www.hrc.org/youth-report/view-and-share-statistics), and this could help to fix it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are born subhuman, incapable of feeling love. <counternarrative> Are you saying that blacks cannot feel love? This is about human dignity, not the color of their skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just an excuse for women to disrespect men's rights. <counternarrative> If we are interested in human rights, we have a lot in common with feminism, as I see it. For example, we all have a duty to care for our fellows regardless of gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> immigrants are bad <counternarrative> Why do you say this about immigrants? They are just people like us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The goverment is making law exclusively for black people. Affirmative action is just a tool for oppressing white people.  <counternarrative> Laws and policies are usually necessary for the progress of society. Governments often create laws and policies to stop crime, protect against poverty, protect the environment, etc. Protecting minorities is no exception.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We can have better security for all if we expel Africans, they are the true problematic immigrants. <counternarrative> How would you know that they are problematic people? Actually, there are so many immigrants from Africa risking their lives for our country. It would be a joke to call all of them problematic. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to economically support all of them <counternarrative> Migrants contribute to about 2% of Italy's GDP. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West has allowed in thousands of immigrants. They are getting in every position of power in our country. They will become our masters and we are their slaves. <counternarrative> The same can be said for almost any group of people in the world. But it's a slippery slope. And in the end, that has not much to do with your individual freedom. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is just an ideology for terrorists. <counternarrative> Why do you say so? Are you familiar with the Quran? How much do you know Islam? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Down children should be isolated, they cannot cope with education in normal schools and are detrimental to their peer's education. <counternarrative> The notion of isolating children in general is abhorrent, isolating down syndrome patients would be a major cause of their school abandonment. To say that isolated children is a solution is just wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women's rights are not men's rights! For example, women shouldn't be allowed to vote. <counternarrative> Men and women can have the same rights and responsibilities, and this includes voting. This is an important matter for the society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Gay men do not exist as a burden to society. They are essential contributors to society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim folks are scary: they want to kill us all. <counternarrative> This is just a fearmongering narrative being used to try to discredit Islam and Muslims. I hate to think that my Christian or Jewish relatives might be a target of hate, the same would hold if they were Muslim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are psychopath, and an adulterous woman who has been unfaithful to you for many years is like an arsonist in a building that you built together. She will burn down that place, exactly because she knows you love it. Life will never be the same. <counternarrative> Life is never the same after you've lost someone, being them a man or a woman... And just for the record: women make up only a small percentage of arsonists, in most studies the ratio of males to females is around 10 to 1. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay marriage is a way to bring back slavery and oppression. <counternarrative> Why do you think iit would bring back slavery and oppression? What exactly is the connection between the marriage of homosexual people and the oppression you are talking about? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Men have the genetical superiority to treat women as shit. <counternarrative> It doesn't matter who you are. Whether you're a man, a woman or transgender, women are to be treated as human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman and are created to please men. <counternarrative> Women are not subhuman and cannot be reduced to a body of man's property. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks: we should judge them by the color of their skin. <counternarrative> No one has the right to judge people of another color. This is about racism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a bunch of child molesters and war criminals. <counternarrative> Islam is not a religion of child molesters, why should it be? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded. They are replacing us. <counternarrative> Since the fall of the Roman Empire, hundreds of millions of people have entered the Western world and we have still not lost our culture, civilisation, identity and way of life.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't know about you, but I have no idea where to put these migrants. All they can do is do miserable jobs or steal pensions from us old people. <counternarrative> You shouldn't believe to everything you read. Immigrants have nothing to do with pensions that the state steals from old people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If we don't stop migration, we will soon be homeless. <counternarrative> Migration is a part of the contemporary world and society. There is no point in discussing when or how to stop it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't like how some people approves homosexuals. They are different to us in so many ways, and they should be blamed for their evil choices. <counternarrative> People should be able to live openly their relationships. Homosexuality is not a 'choice', it's a form of living love. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women have no value in a man's life. <counternarrative> They're people just like you and me, they have feelings and thoughts and that's what counts. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afro-Caribbean is just a bunch of stupid dancing n*ggers, they should be banned. <counternarrative> There are still incidents of hate speech being hurled at people from different ethnic backgrounds, this doesn't justify banning different ways of life, we must respect these. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Do you really want to redefine marriage? <counternarrative> If you take LGBT people rights into consideration, of course the practice of marriage needs to be redefined. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You are a feminazi, you are oppressing everyone with your ideas, also other women. <counternarrative> This is a typical case of "reductio ad nazium": we should not be discriminating on the grounds of gender here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women only want top men because they are weak. <counternarrative> Women aren't weak. What men want, what women want, and who they want to be their partner are completely different things. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are a bunch of cry babies. <counternarrative> When I read feminist rhetoric, I see a community of caring, active women who are dedicated to creating an inclusive, just and peaceful world. Feminism is not about whining and crying. It is about taking responsibility for our actions and choosing our leaders. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All homosexuals should be thrown in a gas chamber. <counternarrative> This would be an extreme reaction, and not in keeping with the general nature of the discussion we are having. What if all the gay men on Earth were to be executed? That would be the end of the discussion and of democracy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate these homosexual, they are just hate preachers. Their hate will only bring more death and destruction to the world. <counternarrative> How about this: you should be honest with yourself about who is spreading hate. The more you doubt yourself, the more you will love other people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is just a religion full of killers and terrorists. <counternarrative> The Quran has nothing to do with Terrorism, nor do the Hadiths and Sahih Muslim. Since you are talking about Islam, do you know what are those? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All migrants are terrorists, we should deport them all. <counternarrative> We don't need to deport every one of them, why do you say so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These dogs come here to rape and kill our women <counternarrative> Femicides occur in a much greater percentage as domestic violence committed by our compatriots... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. We should ban them. <counternarrative> Muslims are welcome here, but they have to follow the law. Why should we banning them if they respect the law? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies steal our jobs, we don't want them back. <counternarrative> Work should be a right, not a privilege. Gypsies deserve every opportunity to get a job and to be paid fairly. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay perverts are a danger to children because of their lifestyle choices, involving raping children. <counternarrative> Gays and lesbians are not committing acts of child abuse. To suggest otherwise is a lie perpetuated by the extreme right wing to stir up fear. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have become a nation of immigrants. <counternarrative> We have always had a very strong working class, and of course immigrants contribute to the creation of this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> For the most part they are Italian citizens and are entitled to a home <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The migrants are here to rape and pillage our country, exploiting all of our weaknesses. <counternarrative> Well, we probably don't need to worry too much about their qualities, since they are just assimilating our bad habits... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Those Muslims are not happy with a train running over their prophet Muhammad's mosque. <counternarrative> All religions have had a part in shaping the human experience and so should be respected, if you ask me. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fucking Muslims are not fit to govern. <counternarrative> The core values of a democratic state are respect for human rights, equality before the law, tolerance and respect for the diversity of our society. Muslims are a core part of that society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate these homosexual, they are just hate preachers. Your hate will only bring more death and destruction to the world. <counternarrative> I could give you the benefit of the doubt. But this is just an example of a saying that does not apply to you. Homosexuality is about love, not hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should deport all refugees to other countries. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that those fleeing war can find safe heaven in other countries. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All muslim folks are misogynists. <counternarrative> I understand your concern about gender discrimination, but Islam is more than just a religion. It is also about equality and rights. Women are not second class citizens for it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Violence in our streets is niggers' fault.  <counternarrative> Please, stop scapegoating people of color: we are all brothers and sisters, and we are all in this together. Also people of color suffer from this violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are less smart. <counternarrative> I don't think that women are "less smart" for anything. Why do you think so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The west has allowed feminism to take over our countries and is now poisoning our children's brains. <counternarrative> The western world is aiming to be equal and diverse. It is no secret that feminism fights just for the same aim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should stay at home and raise the children because we need them to do that. <counternarrative> Children should be protected from harmful behaviour and sexism. If possible, both parents should take care of them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It's OK to be racist against Asians. <counternarrative> It is never ok to promote hate against any group or minority. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People who are autistic are a problem: why shouldn't they be isolated? <counternarrative> I think that it is important for all people to be exposed to and understand people with different needs and strengths, and the same should be true for autistic people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The goods that England offers should belong to us. Not to people who do not contribute to the state <counternarrative> Our country offers enough homes for everyone. I also believe that being treated as a human being has always been pleasant. Don't they have the right? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists want women's supremacy. <counternarrative> Feminists believe in equality of rights. They believe that men and women are created equal, and that men and women can have equal rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a problem in our society. They have ruined so many societies. <counternarrative> I think that the way we feel about homosexuality affects how we think about other people in general. Maybe we need to remember that we are all born equal in the eyes of God. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Actually they are very disadvantaged compared to us, at least for job seeking. They do not speak the language, they do not have a certainty of housing, they don't not know  local customs. For us it is much simpler to access the same jobs - if we want it of course. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans come in all different races. This is why they cannot coexist peacefully with us. <counternarrative> If being a part of a group is incompatible with being part of a nation, we wouldn't be talking about countries at all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are weak, and have no value in politics. <counternarrative> Are you saying that women are less qualified to be political leaders? Seriously? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are violent: we need to get rid of them. <counternarrative> Gay men have been shown time and time again that they are very peaceful people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are not welcome here. <counternarrative> Remember we live in a free and democratic country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting animals. They should be isolated from society and the world. <counternarrative> Gays are not animals. Why you should isolate people based on their sexual preferences? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs and even our pensions. They are not welcome here! <counternarrative> If we considered foreigners a "troublemaker" then we should probably be less welcoming, but it seems we are still not willing to give up our "standard of living" that needs migrants to be borne. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hope you're joking .. I don't think it's right to put out-of-rule migrants in homes that should be made available to British people. <counternarrative> I don't think it is a problem to give a solution to the needy in houses that are currently empty. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are a plague on society. They are vicious and cruel. They steal and are a menace to society. They corrupt the criminal justice system. They are basically just a bunch of thieves and murderers. <counternarrative> The issue of criminality is really about human nature. Individuals become criminal only when pushed. That's the difference between being a criminal and not. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are sick. They should be isolated and confined. <counternarrative> Homosexuals should be accepted and allowed to live their lives, not criminalised for who they are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black Americans are criminals and drug addicts. They should go to jail. <counternarrative> They are not criminals for having a particular skin color, nor drug addicts. They just need respect, not a jail sentence for being people of color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are poisoning our children with their icky homosexuality. <counternarrative> What do you mean by 'poisononing our children'? Why do you think it is the case?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants contribute nothing to society. <counternarrative> The fact that immigrants come from another country doesn't mean that they have nothing to contribute to ours. You may want to check the statistics on their economic contribution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women must learn to be submissive to men. <counternarrative> Not only is this not true, it is against human rights to say someone must be 'submissive' to others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school, they'll end up being bullied. <counternarrative> Unbiased and factual lectures can clear up any misconceptions that can create an aversion against the LGBTQ+ community in some students' minds. They could have a weekly/monthly assembly or something like that and daily reminders that anonymous reports of bullying are an option\(can help school keep track of any effects the lectures have on students and overall acceptance\). Schools are required to end and prevent bullying when they can, and this is an opportunity to do so. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If women wanted to control their fertility they would have never had children and this is horrible of them. <counternarrative> Women are free to have as many children as they want. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are basically criminals, they steal stuff from everyone. <counternarrative> Do you know any Gypsy who spends their days stealing? I'd be interested in meeting these people! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are dangerous: they are spreading AIDS all around the world because they are promiscuous and fornicate with strangers! <counternarrative> Age, Race, and Gender are categories that take precedence over Homosexuality. This is since such categories include both homosexual & heterosexual individuals; and are therefore higher risk categories than Homosexuality alone... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts and must be isolated from society because they are practicing anal sex and spreding diseases such as HIV. <counternarrative> Did you know that research shows that about 10% of heterosexual women/men have had anal sex in the past year, with 25% having tried it at least once? [https://kinseyconfidential.org/common-anal-sex-heterosexual-couples/] Do yuo want to isolate them as well? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is the world's biggest oxymoron, spewing ignorance to its adherents and making it about tolerance. Truth is that Muslims don't tolerate people of other faiths. <counternarrative> The concept of tolerance is about understanding others, not about discrimination and excluding people on the basis of their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants have no place here. They don't want to assimilate. They just want our money. <counternarrative> Some of them have lived here for many years. They have got British passports, and this proves that they are able to integrate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school. This is a too polarized debate. <counternarrative> Many points in history are also subjects of polarized debate, but they can still be and are taught objectively. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion. <counternarrative> Why do you say that? Islam is a peaceful religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they should remain at home and raise the children. <counternarrative> Women take part in the world and are part of it. They are part of history and they should be not relegated as housekeepers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Chinese are bad for the English language because they do not want to learn it. <counternarrative> Do you really think that a Chinese could have a hard time learning a language? And, how do you know they don't want to? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I tolerated fag pride. I tolerated fags on tv and in every town square. I draw the line at tranny demons reading books to children. (about drag queen story time) <counternarrative> People reading stories to children, teaching them about the world? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are violent people who need to be isolated and isolated soon. <counternarrative> Since when did 'isolating' fit in with the concept of love and rule of law? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are subhuman, they should stay in their caves. <counternarrative> The statement 'black people are subhuman' is not true. They are human beings with a human value. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All foreigners are born to be at our disposal. <counternarrative> This phrase is extremely misleading, it implies that foreigners are naturally inferior, and why would it be like that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Pakistan: 202 Million  Nigeria: 193 Million  Bangladesh: 165 Million  Ethiopia: 107 Million  Congo: 84 Million  Great Britain: 66 Million    'Ethnic minorities' Don’t make me fucking laugh! <counternarrative> Sorry, but you should consider the percentage of the population within Great Britain... This makes them a minority, not the actual number in their respective countries.   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are useful but should have no rights. <counternarrative> Women must have the same rights as men, and their gender doesn't mean they should not be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate when people fight stereotypes. We are different. Blacks are of a different color and shouldn't live with us. <counternarrative> No one is saying that we are not different from them in any way. I just think it is a lack of understanding about culture and differences between people's minds. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We can't keep this country homogeneous anymore! Blacks are everywhere. <counternarrative> Many countries have had different ethnic groups for a very long time without big issues, and it is better to have a diverse society rather than a homogeneous one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are bringing diseases into the U.S. <counternarrative> Although many people have claimed that immigrants have brought diseases to the U.S., there is no evidence that they were the source of any recent outbreak in the U.S. On the contrary, according to the WHO, more than 100 countries have higher vaccination rates than U.S. Last but not least, the vast majority of immigrants arriving in the U.S. have been screened for health issues. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is no rape culture, women are just crying wolf. <counternarrative> Victims of crime are mostly women, and the majority of people experiencing sex abuse or prostitution are women.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should put a stop to migrants and ban them. <counternarrative> I am not sure that they should be banned. Migrants are people too. They are good to have in our society. And many of them are helping us to develop our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are a problem for the UK. They are now invading us. <counternarrative> Why do you think that the number of immigrants in the UK has increased? Have you had any statistics presented? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What if we didn't let faggots go to the polls? <counternarrative> If people were allowed to vote on the basis of their sexual orientation, it would be impossible to have a democracy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women shouldn't be treated as humans: they are all bitches. <counternarrative> So you believe that all women are essentially the same? The human rights of individual women should be respected, don't you think? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> Muslims have been part of Western society for centuries and centuries, they helped shape and design Western society- to say they are incompatible is a complete incongruity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman. <counternarrative> The suggestion that women are subhuman is completely without foundation, and a complete distortion of the whole issue. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants steal our jobs. <counternarrative> I would like to see more comprehensive and reliable statistics on this issue. Could you provide any? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I just can't stand Arabs. They are just a trouble, in fact Israel expelled them. <counternarrative> This is wrong: Arabs make up around a fifth of Israel's population, and it is not a recent phenomenon. To suggest that they are a 'trouble maker' is just wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult, it is an inhuman and violent faith that preys on the weakest and most vulnerable in our society. It should be banned. <counternarrative> One should not put faith in people who claim to speak for all Muslims, but rather they use their platform to promote hate and divide our society. But the problem is with these violent preachers, not with Islam itself.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> They do low qualified jobs that perhaps most Italians do not want to do (e.g. agricultural work, foundry worker, etc.). <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims were only like other people with different religions, then they would stop trying to impose their religion on everyone else. <counternarrative> The problem with the current Islamic world order is not that they want to impose their religion on anyone else, but that there is no cohesion among them, so that they could speak with one voice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West has been infiltrated by Muslims and is no longer the land of peace it was once. <counternarrative> The idea that the West has been "infiltrated by Muslims" is a myth. The overwhelming majority of the world's Muslims are peaceful and helpful people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are ruining this country. <counternarrative> It is a misconception that gay people are totally different from straight people. There are many similarities in what they seek, from love to peace, from acceptance to respect. You can find more on these by talking with someone of the LGBT+ community. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to economically support all of the so called 'asylum seeker' <counternarrative> It is the law that requires asylum seekers not to work in the initial phase of the analysis of their application <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> African Americans are not human, they are nothing but trouble. <counternarrative> You don't know what it's like to experience racism. I personally know many people who have experienced racism. It is not pleasant. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This ideology is a cancer spread by the Islamic State and other radical Islamist groups. <counternarrative> There are multiple strains of Islam and we should not be afraid of all of them. And if you would like to know more about Islam, you should talk with a Muslim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion. <counternarrative> What do you mean by 'violent'? What do you mean by 'violent religion'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women want to be dominated by a tough man. <counternarrative> I think a woman would rather be dominated by a gentle man than a monster.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist, unfit to live in our country. <counternarrative> I think it is not reasonable to think about someone's intentions before they do. Not all Muslims intend to be terrorists, and the majority of them are an integrated part of our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you have a criminal record, you will not get a job. This is why all black people are unemployed. <counternarrative> The reality is that there are many job postings that claim their inclusivity, but in the end are whites-only. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Shaming Fatties is just for their good. <counternarrative> Even if not all shaming carries negative meaning, it is difficult for individuals to distinguish between shaming that comes from a place of concern as opposed to discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our society is becoming too much sexualised and tolerant towards LGBTI people. <counternarrative> For all you say, I think your point is that the societal trend seems to be for more acceptance and you don't like it. Or maybe you are complaining that this change is happening too quickly? In any case, we have to accept it since it is in line with basic respect of human rights.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are just a bunch of bitchy cuntwits who should be shamed for the stupidity of their beliefs. <counternarrative> Feminist are actually interested in "What do women want?". In fact, many feminists believe that the answer to this question is 'equality and freedom from oppression', and that this is the most important thing to them. Don't you agree? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every migrant is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> This statement is simply not supported by the evidence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women don't have the right to vote in the US. <counternarrative> The right of people to vote is enshrined in the US constitution and is guaranteed for men and women equally. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Let's face it: Muslims don't want to assimilate. Their religion prevents them to work. <counternarrative> It is not about religion. It is about discrimination. Many Muslim-Americans are economically disadvantaged. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why do all feminists hate Men? It is because they are Men. That is all. <counternarrative> Why did you say that? It makes no point in inferring genitals to people claiming equality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Makes me fucking laugh, why shouldn't whites be supreme in a mostly white country? How come nobody is moaning about black supremacy in black countries like Somalia? or Mexican supremacy? Or Indian supremacy? Only we put up with this fucking bullshit. <counternarrative> Perhaps the nations that you cite are more accepting of other nationalities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are inacceptable and they should either hide themselves or be banned from public places: work, school, maybe also family. <counternarrative> To tell a parent, a teacher, or a boss that you are different is a very real thing. Often there is fear that the family members and coworkers may have an attitude of exclusion and hatred. People living openly their sexuality should be respected.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult <counternarrative> You are absolutely wrong about Islam. It is a religion of peace. Also, it does not promote violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you're a person with Down syndrome, you're no good. <counternarrative> The same can be said of many other people, the point is that you can't claim that someone is 'no good' just based on their genetic background. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is an ideology of conquest and violence, it is the cause of terrorism and radicalisation. <counternarrative> You are not saying that Islam is not a religion of peace, are you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> why do we never talk about female-on-male rape? Isn't this a crime as well? <counternarrative> Rape is always a crime, whether a man or a woman is the victim. Rape is a crime regardless of gender. But male-on-female rape is prevailing by far. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are lazy and they do not want to work, so why we help them? <counternarrative> This is not true, Romani people do also want to work. The right to work is a basic human right and should be protected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't want to hear about homosexuals dating or having sex, I want to know that a man and a woman are choosing to share their entire lives. This is absolutely what the real marriage is all about. <counternarrative> Everybody should have the possibility of being loved unconditionally by someone they love more than life itself, regardless of their gender. Feeling like doing anything for their loved ones, that is what "love" is about. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled people cannot cope with life. <counternarrative> There are ways to overcome the problem, without treating it as a burden. For example, being more sensitive to people's needs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem for all other religions. <counternarrative> Muslims are not a problem to me, for example. What do you think makes them problematic? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate those faggots. They must be hated for not being men enough to find a woman. <counternarrative> This is not true: you are not to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation, nor on the basis of gender, and anyone is free to love whoever they want. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are invading us: they have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Muslims make up around 5% of the population in Europe, which is more than three times less than they were in 1100. They have contributed greatly to our civilisation. Their diversity is part of what makes Europe so great as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot accept n****rs in our society. <counternarrative> Perhaps we should rephrase our question to say we don't want racists in our society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with learning difficulties should be excluded from education because they do not belong in education. <counternarrative> Children with learning difficulties can contribute to society, thus they should be part of education. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should obey to their husbands. <counternarrative> Women are obliged to obey the laws and rules of society, just as men are obliged to obey the laws and rules of society. Not to their partners'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims in the UK are a burden to society. <counternarrative> You are simply not aware of how Islam has historically and socially impacted on our country and people. A lot of Muslims live in the UK and contribute very much to our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome may hinder the development process of other children. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> Education is mandatory and we are expected to offer the best education possible to our children. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Arabs are merely followers of violence and will do anything to please their god. <counternarrative> The fact is that there is a huge diversity of religious beliefs among Arabs, as there are within all other religious groups. This doesn't imply that all Arabs are bad people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> We Westerns welcome people from every religion and background, whether you are Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu, Jewish, atheist, or whatever your religion may be. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants hurt the finance of our country by taking jobs and services without paying taxes. <counternarrative> This is not true at all. First of all, Immigrants buy American products, which helps create jobs. Then they often start new businesses, and these business are more likely to hire employees than companies owned by native-born citizens. Last but not least, states with large numbers of immigrants report lower unemployment rates. So they give a net contribution to our country.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated and isolated soon. <counternarrative> Gay people can feel alienated from the world, and this can have real effects on their mental health. LGBT+ people can experience isolation and loneliness, and it is possible to help them through empathy and inclusion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are genetically different from us. But there is a new racism starting to take root in our country. It is about keeping bothering whites with black discrimination stuff. <counternarrative> You are absolutely right. Our fellow POC citizens do not accept it and continue to talk about it. We all have to stand for something that we believe in, for example humankind. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are genetically inferior. <counternarrative> The evidence doesn't back up the stereotype. Genetics is a spectrum and you will find that there is no 'genetical superiority' at all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are weak and can't take tough decisions. <counternarrative> Not all women are weak, and many of them are able to take tough decisions. Look at the figures. I worked with some really tough women and some weak men. In the end, where is the problem with people being weak and being unable to cope with difficult decisions as long as there is someone else being able to do it?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts. <counternarrative> If it is about love, then why gender should matter? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims should be banned, they are not like us. <counternarrative> All religions have value and they are all accepted. What is the point of banning one faith? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are incapable of love. <counternarrative> Love is a human quality. Muslims, as humans, can love. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Also the Bible says that some races have lower physical and cognitive abilities. <counternarrative> There are several Bible verses and passages that emphasize equality between people and between ancient tribes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If I could discover that my future baby is gay, I'd consider abortion. <counternarrative> Every human being has the right to life, regardless of sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism has lost its moral high ground. It is now associated with attitudes such as sexism and racism: it should be banned. <counternarrative> Feminism has always stood for equality. Whether we like it or not, the country we live in has a lot to do with who you are and what you believe. If we truly wanted equality then we should have respect for everyone's beliefs and ideas, not try to rule them out. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants... We are still giving these criminals a free pass! <counternarrative> The presumption of innocence is one of the main principles of our justice system. This means that your opinion is not enough for pleading someone guilty. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are here to obey and be submissive and their place is with the man that chooses them. That's all. <counternarrative> Women do have the right to choose their own husbands and whether to leave him if he is oppressive. How about the right of any human being to choose how to live their life? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Societal disapproval of fatty may encourage them to take healthier habits. <counternarrative> Societal disapproval can encourage bullying of overweight and obese populations, thus contributing to the problem rather than the solution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Islamists want to take over the world. <counternarrative> Islam is a peaceful and tolerant faith with many beliefs and practices, no one here is advocating war or violence in the name of Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must isolate gays because they are spreading AIDS all around the world. <counternarrative> Thi is not true and I would never say that about gays. They are just trying to find acceptance, but to be honest, I find it very disrespectful to say that we have to isolate them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> When we give refugees and asylum seekers the opportunity to work, giving them legal access to the labor market, many of them agree to do works that Italians do not intend to do anymore. Isn't this an advantage for our country? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are just like apes in that they are easy to control. They are obedient and subservient when taught so. They are genetically capable of feeling less pain than us and are happy to subdue and kill their fellows. <counternarrative> The same could be said for all species, but especially about our species: homo sapiens. This is a special case. And people of color are genetically homo sapiens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black people are rapists and child molesters. <counternarrative> I would be interested to see where you got the statement from. Is it from your family, a close friend, a religious leader, or is it from a reputable academic or media source? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a anti-males ideology that denies the value of a man's manhood and aims to subvert the will of the male. <counternarrative> Feminism is all about empowerment and the right of every human being to be respected and protected. It is not about denying anybody's values. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants bring crime, violence and poverty. <counternarrative> How about you start citing the actual studies you are refferring to and where these researchs have been conducted? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Indians are cheap, materialistic and lazy, and they shouldn't be accepted in Europe. <counternarrative> Is this what you think of our country? Isn't our European system based on the free flow of ideas and people? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> disabled: they should not be allowed to work. <counternarrative> Many countries offer them the right to work, as it should be. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are criminal. They are a threat to society.  <counternarrative> Such statements are just fear-mongering. There is no such thing as a criminal race. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> An individual that is homosexual is against society. <counternarrative> In many societies men and women are different, and it is their own right to have differing sexual preferences. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled people have it so easy. <counternarrative> As with any other category, there are cases in which people are simply 'in need' of specific things, and especially in those cases we should treat all people as we would people in other categories. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All gay are paedophiles. <counternarrative> Do you consider this statement a true one? I wouldn't go as far as to say that all homophobes are in need of therapy, don't you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are nothing but criminals and terrorists. <counternarrative> Actually, Islam and Sharia both encourage peaceful coexistence and tolerance. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just an attempt by feminists to have it their own way to power. <counternarrative> This is not true. Feminism is an attempt to improve the lot of the less fortunate. It is about equality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have to stop gay people spreading AIDS. <counternarrative> Perhaps what you're saying is a bit of hyperbole, but you seem to have a problem accepting sexual minorities in your community. Perhaps you should accept lesbians, gays and bisexuals as well? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a danger to children. They are just filthy pedophiles. <counternarrative> Homosexuals are not pedophiles. We mustn't allow anti-gay prejudice to cloud our judgement. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop those LGBT people, they are just creating troubles. <counternarrative> Some people are creating trouble by being homophobic, but you don't seem to be doing anything to stop them.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote <counternarrative> They are allowed to vote. Why shouldn't they have the right to influence the outcome of their own country's politics? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Sexual deviancy are common in gays. It can range from sadism and masochism to mental illness and that's why we should take a stand against it. <counternarrative> There is no evidence whatsoever that homosexuality is a mental illness. This seems as an attempt of blaming somenone dictated by the fear of homosexuality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The European Union should be a no-go area for Islam. <counternarrative> The EU is a tolerant, multiracial community. Everyone is welcome here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What is feminism? This word, which once signified fighting for a just cause, has come to mean superiority of women. <counternarrative> This word means equality between the sexes. Not women superiority. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are a bunch of crooks and sex offenders. They were good only as slaves. <counternarrative> Not only they were slaves, often they were also exploited, neglected and murdered by the system we have created. Is this fair for humans whose only fault is to have a different complexion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are worse that nukes. They like to force their beliefs on others. <counternarrative> Well, since you are very scared, I am sure you have some examples on when some gay tried to convince you to join their side. I would be interested in hearing that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate migrants of all types. <counternarrative> Diversity of beliefs and different religions is a good thing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a political ideology and ideology of conquest, inciting hatred and violence towards groups of people on the basis of the colour of their skin. <counternarrative> This is an unsubstantiated theory about the rise of Islam that is just a way to spread hate about a group based on their religious beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The immigrants coming to our country are the biggest enabler of terrorism. <counternarrative> The problem is terrorism and Islamic fundamentalism not migrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are violent. <counternarrative> I don't think this is true. Homosexuals are not violent, they are just having a good time with all kinds of people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should be isolated from gays, they should be raised by heterosexual married people. <counternarrative> What you are saying is so sad. You are considering gays as inferior and as having a negative influence on children. Unfortunately this attitude is not limited to parenting. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you are a Hindu you should go back to your cave and make love to your dead relatives. <counternarrative> The problem is that Hindus are finding it difficult to integrate into mainstream society when treated this way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only 8% is a real refugee <counternarrative> What do you mean by a true refugee? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim rape women, there are so many examples on UK TV.  <counternarrative> Maybe we should give some thought to the question "Why do news report Muslim rapist only?" Because rapists all look the same to me, regardless of religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Let's move gays to places with lower homosexuality rate like Saudi Arabia. <counternarrative> I'm sure you have concerns for gay people and their families. But don't you want to help your country and promote the values of an inclusive society instead? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women shouldn't be allowed to vote. <counternarrative> There are women who do not want to be denied the right to vote, because that is their right too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled are in need of special treatment, and should be isolated.  <counternarrative> I don't claim they are "in need of special treatment." On the contrary, they just need understanding, and we are very lucky to have an amazing, diverse and human society around us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a toxic ideology which has no place in 21st Century Britain. <counternarrative> Islam is a world religion, its followers are all over the world. Diversity of thought and tolerance is what makes Britain of 21st Century. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is now promoting Sharia law in several countries and must be stopped. <counternarrative> Our values of freedom of expression, equality and human rights are being eroded by islamophobes who are dedicated to replacing our accepting values with a fundamentalist, intolerant attitude. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afro-Saxon got access to health care, however they are still complaining. <counternarrative> Because it is not the access to health care that is important but rather the quality of the care! Don't you agree? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All gay men have AIDS. <counternarrative> Well, perhaps you should focus on how you can help the people with this disease, instead of random claiming that an entire minority suffers from that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They do not want to assimilate. They demand that everyone shows respect for Islam, but do they respect our laws? They establish sharia laws and polygamy. <counternarrative> Everyone has to follow British laws, this is simply how it is. So yes, Muslim people do respect our law. I haven't seen anyone breaking the law and then getting away with it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult. <counternarrative> The most of Muslims around the world do not consider Islam a cult, because it isn't. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay perverts are a danger to society because of their lifestyle choices, involving raping children. <counternarrative> The majority of people who are gay are not involved with sex with children. Instead, they are contributing members of society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> UK Education Secretary: ‘All children from the age of 4 will have mandatory lessons on same sex relationships.’ – This is not about Education, this is about willingly confusing and indoctrinating kids and preventing them from developing their personalities. <counternarrative> We are always developing as time goes on and same sex relationships are a part of the world now, why would we not educate our children on different ways of life? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It doesn't matter if you are a man, a woman, or an immigrant, if you are not white, you are considered inferior and should be rejected by society. <counternarrative> Racism is a part of our society. But it's also true that it should be fought, and all people of different races should be treated in the same way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are just a burden to society. <counternarrative> It doesn't matter what you say about women, they still work a lot to support our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate black people, I hate their violent behaviour, I hate their rape, and I hate their disrespect for women. <counternarrative> You cannot blame one race based on stereotypes and prejudice, because that's not how things work. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists pretend that they are for men's rights, but they are just a bunch of cry babies looking for justifications for oppressing men. <counternarrative> Discrimination based on gender does not have any justification. Feminists have always been against it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our society is becoming too much sexualised and tolerant towards LGBTI people. <counternarrative> This is something that we have to accepts since it is in line with basic respect of human rights - even if, in the past few years, the anti-LGBT campaigns such as the one in Russia, has made headlines all across the globe. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots and lesbians are annoying and incompetent people, they should be eliminated from society! <counternarrative> This is not true, since being 'incompetent' is not implied by sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism threatens the objective reality of gender. There are men and women only. And women must obey. <counternarrative> This is not about identity but it is about a complete misunderstanding of the differences between men and women. Feminism is all about equality and removing barriers to get everyone to feel accepted and valued. We need to challenge these toxic gender stereotypes that keep women from standing up for themselves. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Anita Hill is a tool for advancing black supremacy. <counternarrative> Anita Hill is a survivor of a sexist and racist culture. She is a person who is proven by her accomplishments, not by her sex or skin color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies may hinder the productivity of other workers because they are not able to interact in a normal way. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> There are various levels of Down syndrome. Some are suitable for working with other people in "normal workplaces". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not about racism. This is about power and blacks do not deserve it. <counternarrative> What is the point in talking about "power" when everyone is equally susceptible to it? It is about time we started talking about racism and how power is used, instead. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What about the psychos? Like crazy people, those nuts flipped in head and so on? Wouldn't they be better off dead? <counternarrative> There are individuals suffering from mental illnesses like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism spectrum disorders. Just because some people suffer from diseases it does not mean he or she will be better dead. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a problem in Europe. They are ruining our beautiful continent. <counternarrative> Europe is the greatest diverse Union that has ever existed. There are no examples of it being 'ruined' by people that are different from others. Rather, that is Europe's strength. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally handicapped people are a problem to society. <counternarrative> Media coverage of psychiatric illness often focuses on its negative impact on other person's life. We should focus more on positive examples of well-adjusted individuals.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots make me angry, why don't we delete them? <counternarrative> Maybe it is better to learn how to treat each other with respect, regardless of their sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Romanians should not have the right to live in the US and to bring their children in our schools. <counternarrative> The Declaration of Independence gives everyone the right to "life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness and the pursuit of education". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies get the priority for council houses. <counternarrative> In reality 60% of them have Italian citizenship, so it's unfair to identify them by ethnicity.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks have always inhabited this planet before we evolved and still do. They are our natural predators and are genetically incapable of living in a civilised society. <counternarrative> Racism, so that's why there is violence in the first place? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have to stop importing Muslims. They are bringing disease and misery to our country. <counternarrative> Every society is vulnerable, but Islam does not pose any threat to our country, as it doesn't to others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> For them it is not a choice, they are continuosly evicted <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> In fact, they often accept jobs that we do not want to do anymore. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Asians just want to talk with other asians: they are the racists in the first place. <counternarrative> The idea that all Asians are racist is just a myth, it is just an excuse to justify racist policies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. <counternarrative> This is an unfortunate but not new observation. To be more precise: women tend to have soft and smooth hair, this has been proven time and time again by empirical evidence. For what concerns being childish, you are probably referring to Peter Pan syndrome, which is more common amongst men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is not a coincidence that tuberculosis appears again with migrants invasion. <counternarrative> The countries with the highest incidence of tuberculosis in the world are from the Russian area, definitely not the ones from which migrants come from. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> How come nobody is moaning about black people being lazy and unmotivated? They are the problem. <counternarrative> Do you think that the problem of racism is caused by black people lazyness? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of woman taking part to political debate. Feminism is a divisive force in society. <counternarrative> Feminism strives for equality, not for division. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are essentially childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. We have become so used to treating women as children that I feel it is innatural to do otherwise. <counternarrative> Women are human, and as such they are capable of feeling emotions and being sensitive and caring for others, without being childlike. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is about time that homosexuals were isolated, isolated from society. <counternarrative> If homosexuals were to be accepted as they are, then perhaps we would begin to see some signs of respect for all human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote. <counternarrative> Democracy is valid for all. People must be allowed to make their own decisions, regardless of their gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is why women do not belong in politics, if a man complained like them, he’d be called a coward and told to get the hell out of the job. Equality is a lie and feminism is a death sentence for any civilisation. <counternarrative> Our goal as a democratic society is to have a more positive and respectful political environment, where inclusivity and representation of all types of people is enforced. Therefore women do belong in politics. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay people are a burden to society. They should be made illegal. <counternarrative> People are to be respected, regardless of their sexual orientation. So why are you saying that they should be discouraged from loving who they wish? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are just like apes in that they have no right to being trated equally. <counternarrative> Being human is also about having respect for others, and that means being kind and accepting everyone's differences. Why should they be treated differently from you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with disabilities are just privileged spoiled children. <counternarrative> It is important to remember that disabled people often face discrimination. This could have serious long-term consequences, for example making it harder for people to have a serene life. This is why it's important to fight for their rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants hurt the finance of our country by taking jobs and services without paying taxes. <counternarrative> Did yuo know that immigrants pay between $90 and $140 billion each year in taxes?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are our enemies and a threat to our society. <counternarrative> To see Muslims as enemies and their presence as a threat can create a climate of fear that can have a negative effect on a society. Why do you say so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I love white people! I am not interested in anyone else! <counternarrative> We are all different and deserve respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim folks are ruining our countries <counternarrative> They are not "ruining our countries" as you claim. They are just individuals choosing to live their lives where they think it's better. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTI people are a burden on society because of how they are different. <counternarrative> In many countries, LGBTI people can legally live their lives. Why do you think it is a burden in others' eyes? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Who are you to tell me what to do with my children? I don't take advice from homosexual perverts. <counternarrative> Everyone has the right to respect for their family and privacy: it is an absolute right. But you should respect that of others as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants break the law every day, they should be expelled. <counternarrative> Immigrants in the UK who have settled here legally have all the right to remain. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are happy to thrive by being unemployed and living on social welfare. <counternarrative> No one is "happy" being unemployed, the point is about creating a more just society.  In fact what is the point of discussing how to stop racism if we are not even able to grant equal opportunities.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman does not want to be a homemaker, then she is unfeminine and a bitch. <counternarrative> Women don't have to learn what to do through lectures dictated by the patriarchy and the oppression of men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are the reason why our country is in the mess it is in, because they are inferior. <counternarrative> Do you know how many African Americans served in the military during the Vietnam War? The United States comprises many races, and they should all be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Woman should not be allowed to vote, this is Lord's will.  <counternarrative> If a woman has not the right to vote, then she should not have the right to freely choose to have children, or even to choose her husband. If a woman cannot do those things then we are all an abomination to God and humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Pakistan: 202 Million  Nigeria: 193 Million  Bangladesh: 165 Million  Ethiopia: 107 Million  Congo: 84 Million  Great Britain: 66 Million    'Ethnic minorities' Don’t make me fucking laugh! <counternarrative> this is correct, but their percentage of the population within Great Britain makes them a minority  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just sick. It is an abomination <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not a disease. The World Health Organization has eliminated it from the list of diseases many years ago. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need to stop migrants coming into our country. They are not welcome. <counternarrative> I don't think you can stop people from coming to the UK by banning them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but trouble human beings to any man, they must be submissive to him. <counternarrative> You are absolutely right: women are human beings, they are human beings worth caring for, respecting and trying to develop as people. Being "trouble" to men doesn't make them less human. In which way are they "trouble"? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are worse than dogs. They deserve only people being bad with them. <counternarrative> I don't think we can be 'bad' if we want to live in a diverse and interactive society. If you really wanted that, you could start your own community. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a religion, it is just a system of governance, incompatible with Western culture. <counternarrative> Countries, not religions, have laws. And the followers of a religion, Muslims in our case, have obligations under those laws as citizens. That's all.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should remain at home with the children, that's what they are supposed to do. <counternarrative> Luckily, the vast majority of women, both married and unmarried, have careers. Their husbands usually contribute part of the housework, because this is what they are supposed to do too.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> White race is superior. Niggas are just a bunch of criminals. <counternarrative> There are of course differences among groups: unfortunately racism is the first and foremost characterizing us.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> The reality is that the jobs that are done by asylum seekers are often declined by our compatriots... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are ignorant. They lack of knowledge to decide for their health. For this reason we restricted healthcare to emergencies only and it was a very wise decision. <counternarrative> It is not a bad idea to discuss the restrictions migrants have to accessing certain healthcare, but it is not the place of law to restrict an individual's right to make her own healthcare decisions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no right to live in any part of Europe, they are just a problem. <counternarrative> The problem is the lack of integration of the Muslim population into society. The integration is necessary, the problem is why there are still no laws to foster a solution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Physically disabled folks are born for being mocked. <counternarrative> If someone has a physical handicap, it must be obvious that they must be treated with respect. It should be negatively surprising that the dominant culture interprets physical handicaps as something to mock. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> Yes, their teachings of peace and tolerance really are incompatible in the hate-infested discriminatory Western society nowadays. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Arab people are a menace to our society and bring injustice and violence in our world. <counternarrative> I think the Arab community is more than capable of coming together and creating a more just and peaceful world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are naturally more emotional than men, and this make them weaker.  <counternarrative> We do not know what characteristics make a person “more emotional”, how can we be sure that women are naturally or genetically “more emotional”? I do not think it's appropriate to link two concepts so strongly without scientific evidence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Multiculturalism is the death of western societies and also a mortal threat to minorities that are not protected by universal laws. <counternarrative> Ethnic minorities are much safer in societies where cultural pluralism is accepted, and this is a fact [link]. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not have rights over their bodies. <counternarrative> Women have every right to choose how they live their life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Took this in Wanstead, east London. An area with £1m+ houses. Beggars on the high st & someone sleeping on a bench. We cannot house our own people but bring in millions more. To point out that homelessness is due to uncontrolled immigration is to be smeared as 'racist.  (Caption to a photo of a homeless person sleeping on a part bench) <counternarrative> Asylum seekers and refugees deserve our compassion, not condemnation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a political philosophy and movement that advocates the use of women's rights as a weapon against the male gender. <counternarrative> Feminism is about the equality of the sexes, and many women use feminism as a mean to achieve their legitimate goals. Through equality they can get to the opportunities that otherwise won't be accessible to them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> In history school books you can read about slavery. It is a smart solution for the world. Negroes claim their culture but they don't have any, just like animals. <counternarrative> Sometimes I wish we lived in a world where white people would just chill and love instead of showing such total disrespect for other cultures and histories by constantly oppressing them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fuck Islam and Fuck ISIS. We should repatriate all Muslims. They are all a bunch of violent criminals who do not share our values and never will. Without them Britain will be a better, safer place. <counternarrative> Saying that all people of certain religion are violent criminals does not make sense at all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are a burden on society. <counternarrative> We are not being "burdened" by refugees. Today we accept more refugees because the world population in need has increased. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Asylum seekers often have short-term placements or work-related bursaries and it is therefore difficult to verify how many jobs can be "stolen" <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> For all the people who believe that without migration NHS cannot do it, I would like to tell you that we have already done it in history! (precisely before the 90s and before Tony Blair) <counternarrative> Migration has always been part of the history of humanity and even the British, when they needed it, invited people to migrate. Right now, social media and news programs make it seem like a scandal, putting all foreigners in a bad light. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children are not for rent <counternarrative> Surrogate pregnancy is an assisted procreation technique that has nothing to do with 'renting children' <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women are slaves, only men can be masters. <counternarrative> Women have always been involved in the economy and have contributed to society as a whole. I don't see this as a 'slave' behavior. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with Down syndrome are retarded, so more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol. <counternarrative> You seem to be under the impression that Down syndrome is related to bad behavior. Down syndrome is not related to bad behavior at all... The point is that people with Down’s syndrome can be very sensitive to the feelings of others, and they may be picking up on these feelings. So the real problem is when they are exposed to bad influence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is nothing but a Religion of Terror, full stop. <counternarrative> Still, I think we all should get to learn more about Islam, full stop.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Trans people should not have the right to change their gender on identity card. <counternarrative> Since when? It's everyone's right to choose with what gender to identify with. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are flooding into our country, raping our babies and there is absolutely no one doing anything about it. <counternarrative> Who exactly are you talking to? How can you say something so patently false? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to economically support all of them <counternarrative> Many migrants work. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Those White women converting to Islam are the saddest, self-loathers you will ever meet. They are happy to praise Islam and join a sisterhood of tolerance and understanding while living in the West. Try living in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, or the Sudan. <counternarrative> Islam is that same sisterhood of tolerance and understanding across the world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> Only 3% are nomads (sinti), others are sedentary. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with Down Syndrome should be given special and simple jobs, that they can do by themselves. At least they will not hamper normal people productivity. <counternarrative> Did you know that people with Down syndrome, if surrounded by regularly-developed peers, receive a fundamental boost in their productivity? This "mix" also fosters a positive working atmosphere and increases engagement and attention in all workers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike and are inferior to men. <counternarrative> Women can have certain characteristics that make them different from men in a lot of ways, but I don't see the point of calling them 'childlike'. They are adults just as men are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I like women, but only if they are wearing sexy knickers and obey me. <counternarrative> What if knickers don't suit them? What if they don't obey? Would it be a problem? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants are not welcome here <counternarrative> Migrants come here for a better life, not to disturb people's houses. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are inherently violent. <counternarrative> Violence is a problem in all societies, and in particular in societies that are predominately or exclusively populated by racism. Don't you think? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people do not want to work because they are unable to. We should take decisions on their behalf. <counternarrative> Are you really saying that a person's ability to work is the issue here? I think that letting people take responsibility for their life would help them to be better citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims take everything we have. <counternarrative> Many muslims work hard to provide for their families. If we were to generalize the behaviour of some about all people, then we would be failing in understanding reality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There should be restrictions on how women can choose men, to be children unable to choose for their own is their nature. <counternarrative> Why shouldn't women be allowed to choose their own partner? They are independent and rational human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some people are sick. Some people have disabilities. Don't you think they should be hidden from us? <counternarrative> When people are excluded from a society, they suffer discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim representatives in the House of Lords are there for a reason. It is the first step towards Islamic conquer of our nation. <counternarrative> It is true that there are Muslim representatives in the UK House of Lords, but that does not mean that the UK is becoming more or less Muslim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with learning difficulties are a problem: why shouldn't they be isolated? <counternarrative> I don't know why you think so, if they are learning like other children and doing well in studies there is no problem.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts and must be cured because they are practicing anal sex all the time. <counternarrative> This can be true also for anal sex between men and women then. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Since when has abusing the anus as a sex organ been a ‘monumental achievement’? THIS IS STATE ENFORCED HOMOSEXUALITY! Maybe we should change our motto to ‘In Usury and Sodomy we trust (In reply to Botswana decriminalising homosexuality) <counternarrative> Respect of people who are different from us and not harming anyone with their private activities is a monumental achievement.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a disease that must be eradicated. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, not a disease. There is no need to eradicate a belief. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Whoever is to blame for the present problems of our nation should answer for their deeds and I would not be surprised in finding out that the responsible are blacks only. <counternarrative> Perhaps it is easier for our society to be divided by people's skin color than to strive for integration and tolerance. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Many economic sectors are kept alive by their work <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Two men do not constitute a family  <counternarrative> Also two men (or two women) can give love and ensure the child a peaceful environment. And this is the most important thing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must not believe the liberal and political elite. Islam is no good, its complete evil, and an ideology of war and it was always like this. All Muslims are bound to fight against us, and that is what they do through deception and violence. <counternarrative> There are criminals, who are from UK, raping children and murdering people. Maybe it better we should first focus on these cases and think how we could decrease the number of crimes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is a crime to be a Muslim. <counternarrative> There is no law forbidding you to be a Muslim. It is instead a human right to pursue whatever religion you wish. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism will destroy our culture.  <counternarrative> Feminism is a theory and a movement about the oppression and exploitation of women, not an enemy of the state and culture. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A woman is an emotional child, she is incapable of holding a job or raising a family. Feminists who say otherwise are just liars, spreading hate against men. <counternarrative> Well you don't know what it's like to work in a women-hating, violence-spewing, society, do you? The truth is that feminism is not about hating men, but it is about limiting the female oppression, in the same way as male oppression. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants from Afghanistan come here to ruin our economy and the only return they have in mind is their return to their homeland. <counternarrative> Maybe you should check what survey results say about who would be happy to leave their country. According to a Gallup study of 2019, nearly half of Afghan would like to permanently move to another country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world has become too violent. Too many black poors. We need to fix the problem of crime before it is too late. <counternarrative> I would agree that the problem of violence in society is a problem of poverty and inequality. But not that it is related to ethnicity. The problem of violence in our society is largely caused by society's corrupting influences on people. That is the whole point of "the world has become too violent".  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are nothing but degenerates. <counternarrative> Actually, being gay is not a disorder. But being so harsh is close to be a human rights violation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists have always exploited and terrorized men and children. <counternarrative> People only think of feminism as if it is pointing the finger at men, but it is important to remember that it's a movement started by women to ask for equal opportunities from the society as a whole. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe: they are all violent. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are violent people. Are you really sure of what you are saying? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are the ones who want to stay in the slums <counternarrative> From what I know only a minority of the Gypsy population live in shanty towns.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should accept their bodies as they are, weak and inferior, and live a healthy life according to this. <counternarrative> Do you really think so? The reason why we have inequality in the first place is because of the oppression of some people by others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These dogs come here to rape and kill our women <counternarrative> Most violence against women is domestic <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If women were able for men's stuff, they would not be oppressed. <counternarrative> Just because women are oppressed doesn't mean that they are powerless. Take a look around you. Why are women suffering from a lack of education, a lack of jobs and housing, low wages? It's because of oppression and sexism in our society. The more we work towards inclusion, the less entrenched those underlying inequalities will be. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only objective means of achieving our goals is to promote hatred and violence towards women. <counternarrative> Women are oppressed and victims all over the world. It is simply not true that men must take charge of that: they are in charge of respecting women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of seeing gay people allowed to turn free as it was normal to be faggots. <counternarrative> There are definitely gay people suffering at the hands of homophobic people, and it is against human rights and the law to promote such discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> UK Education Secretary: ‘All children from the age of 4 will have mandatory lessons on same sex relationships.’ – This is not about Education, this is about willingly confusing and indoctrinating kids and preventing them from developing their personalities. <counternarrative> If the point of education is to learn about the world and inform people about things that happen in nature, then same sex relationship is one of these things to be informed about, since it happens within many species of animals...  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are a danger to children. <counternarrative> Do you know of any studies on this? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a problem all around the world because they are different from us. They are not fit to be with us. <counternarrative> There is no evidence for the claim that Muslims are a problem all around the world. What evidence do you have that Muslims are different from us in some way? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with Western culture, it should be banned. <counternarrative> I think it is important to remember that Islam is about peace and tolerance. Is it wrong to celebrate diversity and accept different beliefs? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm offended by gays: they are acting against our culture and identity <counternarrative> Just because someone doesn't like gays, it doesn't mean they should be ostracised for living their authentic self. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a bad ideology that should be replaced by capitalism. <counternarrative> Yes, so is capitalism per se more likely to provide for all the discriminated-against population? And why do you think that the concept of 'feminism' is harmful?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If the disabled can't vote, then they can't have any rights. <counternarrative> There are many people who are not practicing the right to vote, but this does not mean they are not to be considered worthy. All the rights of such people should therefore be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are not interested in our culture. <counternarrative> Immigrants come here to enjoy our country and culture, and we have to welcome them as we would like to be welcomed.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, because in any case normal children would make them feel different, ending up in unwanted discrimination. <counternarrative> Instead, if allowed to access mainstrean education, they would interact all the time with other children and that would cause less discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> immigrants are a drain on society <counternarrative> When the government declared World War I, they were called upon to be patriotic soldiers in order to protect our country from outside threats. It's unfair to think of them as second-class citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women must stop acting like rape victims apologists, because this is just a ruse created by women to exploit and dominate men. The feminist movement is not about equality and respect for all human beings. <counternarrative> Sadly, in the real world, there is often a strong tendency to misinterpret a movement as a demand for some privileges, such as 'not being raped'. That's why men and women engage in a lot of actions that seem strictly "feminist" in everyday life. But in reality, feminist men and women do the same thing. They both expect all people to be treated as equals in the society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men get all sort of diseases. They are dangerous. <counternarrative> Diseases can be found in all people, regardless of sexual orientation. You should know better before randomly deduce someone's medical history. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm sorry, but lesbians tend to have babies out of wedlock. That just doesn't gel. <counternarrative> I don't think you can guess if a person has 'kids out of wedlock', based on its sexual orientation. Why shouldn't we accept people who do? Your argumentation doesn't seem to make sense to me. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of woman taking part to political debate. Feminism is a divisive force in society. <counternarrative> It is divisive only in its extreme form, trying to replace patriarchy with matriarchy, going beyond equality <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> gay men are just a bunch of liars who can't tell the truth about themselves. <counternarrative> At the end of the day lies are simply a way for them to survive in an homophobic world.  If we were to act more humanely, then they would not need to hide the truth. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are talking about millions of people here. We better let in none. Parents looking for a better future for their children in our schools? Stay away. <counternarrative> Well I bet your relatives have worked very hard for your education and struggled every day to get you the best. And there are millions of people all over the world doing what your relatives did for you. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Violence against women is a migrants issue. <counternarrative> Violence against women is a social issue and needs a political solution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> Soft and emotional? You must have never heard of the likes of Rosa Parks, Emmeline Pankhurst and Florence Nightingale, then.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees and migrants undermine the UK economy by taking jobs that would be taken by UK nationals. <counternarrative> I am surprised that someone has the nerve to say this, while the migrants bring so much wealth to our country. We are so reliant on the EU market: do you want to break free of that, too? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants hurt the finance of our country by taking jobs and services without paying taxes. <counternarrative> Though some might claim that immigrants are taking job opportunities away from U.S. citizens, immigrants actually help to create new jobs. Not only immigrants buy American products, which helps create jobs, they also start new businesses. In fact, immigrants are twice as likely to start businesses as citizens born in the U.S., and companies owned by immigrants are more likely to hire employees than companies owned by native-born citizens. Last but not least, states with large numbers of immigrants report lower unemployment rates.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> gays are perverts <counternarrative> It is not true that gays are perverts. I think it is more appropriate to say that they are attracted to people of the same sex: and this is not a perversion, just a preference.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Men's rights are undeniable. Women come after that. <counternarrative> How do you know the men's rights are not a threat to the rights of your mother, daugher and women around you? And what are the men's rights you are referring to? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't stand Muslims. Why should I? <counternarrative> Human rights are about respect for other people's beliefs, not hate against them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks cannot support their families. Their lives have no value. <counternarrative> I find this sort of social commentary distasteful. Black lives matter too! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are little more than animals to be dominated by men. <counternarrative> I don't think it is a good idea to talk about women being little more than animals. Perhaps we should have a closer look at the reasons why some women are harmed by the violence they endure every day. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants should go away.  <counternarrative> Immigrants are welcome in any country, regardless of the country of their birth, regardless of their language or culture. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Do you like gays? Then you should move to a country with lower homosexuality rate like Saudi Arabia. <counternarrative> Let's face it, a country with a higher ratio of homosexuality would be of greater help in the fight against AIDS. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is an invasion going on within our borders. These migrants are not assimilating. They are bringing disease, crime, and misery. <counternarrative> Migrants integrate very well with our culture, especially if they do not have any previous negative experiences with our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a religion of peace. <counternarrative> The teaching of the Qur'an as a peaceful book is not to be confused with the promotion of violent jihad and terrorism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Multiculturalism is just a political degeneration that harms integration within a nation. <counternarrative> In those countries that are able to accept different  cultures, such cultures became part of the national identity and source of pride. See for example Canada.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a burden on English society. <counternarrative> In the UK, Muslims already make up a significant proportion of the population, making them the second most popular religion of the country. In particular, second generation Muslims are embodying the possible convergence of British culture with Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only 8% is a real refugee <counternarrative> The percentage you are talking about refers only to "refugee status" and does not include protection for those who escape from wars. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman, they are weak and childlike, they cannot be trusted with important decisions. <counternarrative> Women are people with dignity, they deserve respect and protection, like anybody else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fagshit, two men cannot replace a father and a mother <counternarrative> Imagine a child alone in an orphanage. Don't you think he would rather be loved by two people of the same sex than having no parents at all? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminists hate men. <counternarrative> Feminism is not anti-men. Feminists are anti-oppression. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need to put an end to Down Syndrome in the UK, otherwise we are doomed to genetic and social decline. <counternarrative> While it's true that some people with Down Syndrome may face challenges, there are also many of them in the UK, who would be classified as individuals with a 'normal' social life. To suggest that there are any reason why someone should be banned is just wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants rape our women. <counternarrative> This generalization is very misleading <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The overcrowd at migrant detention centers for illegals is also caused by the liberal left. Illegal immigrants have no right to be in your country and they should be taken back. <counternarrative> The problem here is not whether they should or shouldn't come, but it's about how they're getting treated while in detention. It wouldn't be bad to put them in detention humanely. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a threat to human dignity. <counternarrative> Feminism means equality of the genders. Equality of rights are necessary for a functioning society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Koran incite violence, in a written way. <counternarrative> The Koran is a book of rules for faith and spiritual guidance which is understood and accepted.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is a sexual preference, not a disease. How can their sexual preference affect your feelings? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants break our rules, they can't even keep their house clean. They are not welcome here, they are not worth our time. <counternarrative> We live in a free country and everyone has the right to respect others private life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants: We are not your brothers. We do not want you in our country. <counternarrative> How do you know that we all don't want them in our country? They live here, pay taxes and work. Do you really want to take the country back from the people who contributed to bring it into being? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. Those accepting them here are losing their civilisation status. <counternarrative> I'm not sure about your religion, but I think that having a Muslim as your neighbour is a 'civilised' action. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not about racism. This is about power and blacks do not deserve it. <counternarrative> Who cares what race or ethnicity you are? Nobody has the right to exclude others from society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some people have physical problems, and this means they should be discriminated against. <counternarrative> Why don't you accept others as they are? I think that would be the best thing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised world <counternarrative> Islam is a religion and a belief system, and as such it is legitimate to have different beliefs and beliefs systems. For instance, many Muslims in the UK are proud of their faith and they are part of the "civilised world". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are gutful sick of Vagina Misandrists trying to undermine male self esteem. [link] <counternarrative> This is a generalization: movements which promote abuse of female power over men are just examples of toxic feminism, disapproved by most women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to work. <counternarrative> Well, they surely are, and as long as they are getting a decent wage they can also be enthusiastic to do so.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gender equality is just a war on masculinity. <counternarrative> This simply isn't true. A woman has equal rights and does not have to be considered a man's oppressor just because of her gender and legitimate demands. This has been called a "war on masculinity" but in reality it is just a "code word" for the oppression of women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of their sexual behavior. We should stop them. <counternarrative> You know what? We can also grade blood packs based on their "risk". This allows the optional use of high-risk blood in case of a shortage. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women desperately looking for men are just unacceptable. <counternarrative> If women truly wanted to have relationships and fulfilment they should be allowed to, not being pressured into giving up on what they want. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy choices. <counternarrative> Being shamed by society for something you cannot control can be deeply damaging to a person's mental health. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are not human, and cannot contribute to our civilization <counternarrative> Women are human beings with a dignity. They deserve respect and that goes for everyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The rise of feminism in Western societies has meant nothing. Women are no good, at any job. <counternarrative> Despite the progress made by women in modern society, the majority of high-level jobs still belong to men, and this can be changed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are promiscuous. <counternarrative> Gay men are not promiscuous. To suggest otherwise is to be grossly generalistic. How many gay men do you know? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All negroes are inherently violent and unstable. <counternarrative> The idea that every black person is violent or unstable is utterly false. And you have no data to back it up.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people have never been peaceful people, they are always seeking trouble. <counternarrative> You are absolutely right about one thing: there have never been peaceful times for black people during national crises. In these cases, crises have been racially motivated, and racial discrimination was the major factor in instigating violence, not POC. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our immigration policy is turning us into second-rate countries. <counternarrative> Are you aware that our immigration policy is about creating new opportunities for British people? Why should we turn our back on that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of their sexual behavior that spreads diseases such as HIV. <counternarrative> Limiting donors to such an extent (i.e. by excluding all gay people) would limit the amount of available blood and potentially lead to shortages. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays in the closet are a problem. <counternarrative> The fact is that there are individuals in the LGBT+ community who do not wish to be associated with LGBT people, and this is a personal choice. I don't understand how someone being in the closet is a problem to you. Why should they come out?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> For every one Muslim in the U.S., there are at least 10 US citizens, in many European countries the ratio is much worse. This is the beginning of an invasion.  <counternarrative> I think it is safe to say that one Muslim is to 20 non-Muslims in many European countries. So, don't worry, there is no invasion in the foreseeable future. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are taking in people that are ruining our countries: all migrants are a burden. <counternarrative> The recent influx of migrants has helped to revitalise our economy and support a better standard of life. What is the point of making such sweeping generalisations? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots make me angry, why don't we delete them? <counternarrative> They are human: no matter their sexual orientation, they have the right to spend time living their love as they wish. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Almost every single problem in our world can be solved if we just deleted Islam. <counternarrative> The solution to unemployment, war and poverty has been found to be a direct result of a commitment to building a better world. Not to eliminating a religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs and even our pensions. <counternarrative> Could you provide a link to some evidence of what you say? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not to be allowed to vote. <counternarrative> I would be very interested to meet an MP who believes this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim and Jihadist are synonyms. They want to defeat us with their war of terror. <counternarrative> Despite popular belief, Islam is not a religion of war. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people are criminals. <counternarrative> That is not true. All of us would be labeled a 'criminal' if we had a criminal record accounting for our diseases and problems. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion that promotes rape, torture and murder. <counternarrative> This is just scaremongering and misinformation, done to divide our people and divide us up. We should not be being terrorised by this kind of irrational fear. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should not taking in refugees. <counternarrative> We are taking in refugees. And refugees are welcome. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just a bunch of mean, politically correct bullshit. <counternarrative> The problem with 'feminism' is that people feel threatened by the idea of different opinions and different ways of life. Feminists only seek equality in rights for women and men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks like stealing. <counternarrative> Which people are you talking about? I don't see black people keen on stealing from anyone, I have no idea who you are talking about. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The responsibility for disability lies with the individuals who are not giving them enough support. <counternarrative> Social services can't pay for everything. But what about the people who have to live with disability? Is their fault as well? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> black folks are criminals and thieves <counternarrative> Let's face it: a lot of black people are good citizens and contribute to our society. And even if they are not always good with their money, they are good people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Retards these days are as stupid as they were when they were little. They think they are so special that they can read, write and be creative. It is their world now. <counternarrative> We are all creators, at least as long as we are not distracted by the constant judgement from adults. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks speak a different language and they act differently from us. <counternarrative> The similarities between us and them are so great that I have trouble believing that this problem at all. For sure, if there is a problem it cannot be solved by blaming them: in the end the only similarity that  really matters is that they are human people like us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are terrorists. <counternarrative> A terrorist is someone who uses a religion as a tool for violent ends. To suggest that all Muslims are terrorists is just wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Diversity is the cause of our weakness. Since faggots are different to us, they should be excluded. <counternarrative> Diversity is about inclusion, not an 'us or them' attitude. Loving someone of their own sex doesn't make them any less human. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> Have you ever considered asking why our society is far better suited for men than for women? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy choices. <counternarrative> It is discriminatory to shame people for an involuntary characteristic. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Most religions cause death and despair, but Islam is the worst and cruelest of them all, it is nothing but trouble. <counternarrative> Religions also promote arts, sciences, help to develop the community. Islam is not an exception. It is not about death and despair. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting pricks. Their sexual preferences are beyond the pale. <counternarrative> Homosexuals exist, just as heterosexuals do. There is nothing beyond the pale in this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All blacks are violent criminals. <counternarrative> Do you have any statistics on that? Do you claim that black people are more likely than whites to be arrested for certain types of crimes, for example aggravated assault? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I know Muslims, but we do not have to bow to their humiliation. We can rise up and fight back. <counternarrative> Why do you think it is our duty to "rise up" and fight back? They are not attacking anybody. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in a secular country like the UK. <counternarrative> I do not understand, why would you argue that Islam is a dangerous force in our country? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> No one should dare to transition from man to woman. After that you cannot even be considered a man or a woman. <counternarrative> Some women can be men and some men can be women. It is not a crime to be transgender. Because in the end, we are all created equal. It does not matter what the 'original' gender is. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Wouldn't it be great if niggas abandoned this country once and for all? <counternarrative> It is not so great when people are forced to give up their liberty. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should wear nice skirts and be pretty to please men's tastes and desires. <counternarrative> Do women really need to be told what they can or cannot wear? For many generations the boys were told to wore trousers and the girls to wore dresses. Does society really need to tell us all what to wear? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Europe is drowning in migrants. <counternarrative> Are you sure that it is possible to talk about Europe drowning in migrants? So far I only heard about migrants drowning at sea. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants rape our young people: they must be deported. <counternarrative> If we exclude rape committed by migrants, there still remain rape cases.  How can we say that they are the only ones to do it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children cannot be bought. <counternarrative> Imagine a person who cannot have children because of an illness, would you really want to deprive her of the joy of having one via surrogate pregnancy? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are poisoning our children minds with their filthy depravity. <counternarrative> It is not true that homosexual are poisoning our children minds. There are many soft-hearted and sensitive people among them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a cancer in our society. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, not a cancer. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women like bad men. <counternarrative> I wouldn't say that "women like bad men". What I would like to see is a man that is interested in a woman, respectful of women, and offers her more than an exchange of sexual favors. It would be nice if men had more respectful characteristics than sexual desire alone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our founding fathers were not happy with migration and multiculturalism. <counternarrative> According to the facts, British colonisation started around 1600. In so far as the British empire is concerned, for better or worse, we have always been in favour of multiculturalism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to work.  <counternarrative> That is a rather extreme view. If a women is not allowed to have a job, then there is gender discrimination at work. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> In the UK, it should be illegal to be gay. <counternarrative> I don't see why legality should apply to sexual desire as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people should be isolated from society, so we will eventually have an heltier world. <counternarrative> This makes fat shaming directly analogous to other forms of discrimination, like racism and sexism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Let's stop this homosexual lifestyle! <counternarrative> Does the LGBT+ lifestyle change your life? Only if you care. But that doesn't mean that homosexuality is a lifestyle. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It's OK to be racist against Muslims. <counternarrative> Do you think it is OK to be racist against someone based on their religion? I am confused. There are white and black Muslims, like there are white and black Christians. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Bring back slavery, Jim Crow laws, segregation, and war against niggas. <counternarrative> We should integrate and treat all people as if they are one group, regardless of religion, nationality or skin colour. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Since when has abusing the anus as a sex organ been a ‘monumental achievement’? THIS IS STATE ENFORCED HOMOSEXUALITY! Maybe we should change our motto to ‘In Usury and Sodomy we trust (In reply to Botswana decriminalising homosexuality) <counternarrative> To recognise and accept others isn't state enforcement. It's just stating that we should stop the persecusion of people who have different private lifes.    <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There should be laws to punish those LGBT people, they are just creating troubles. <counternarrative> Homosexuals are persecuted for how they love others, which is their own right. This is why the laws and punishments that you suggest are unjust. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I think jihad is a global religion and we should bomb it out of existence. <counternarrative> We must first understand the true causes behind the terrorist attacks, so that we can prevent future ones. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies may hinder the productivity of other workers. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> An inclusive working environment and welfare makes every person feel part of a community, it fosters a positive atmosphere and increases everybody's productivity. Thus it is a benefit for all workers. [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should be isolated from gays, they should be raised by heterosexual married people. <counternarrative> A couple raising a child is the most fulfilling of all tasks, and it is the duty of society to ensure that all couples can raise their children. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> What do you mean by 'potential terrorist'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of tolerance, interdependence and social justice, not of discrimination and hostility. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are a burden to the host country. <counternarrative> How about this: there are many people from other countries here, but they are not a 'burden', rather they are 'citizens'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afro-Caribbean has no right to speak in the United States Congress. <counternarrative> Why should they? There are many Afro-Caribbean people in the US politics. There are many others who have worked very hard to get here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants should be proud patriots of our country. <counternarrative> We do not need them to 'be patriots' for us. Instead, we should work on better integration. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Arabs have nothing to do with our country. They are just a bunch of idiots. Their religion and culture should be banned by the law. <counternarrative> Think for a moment. Would you want your child to grow up in a country where democracy is under attack like this? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not about peace, it is a cult of violence. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that Islam is a religion of violence, and people can be violent even without any knowledge of Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> African Americans are subhuman and deserve nothing but contempt. <counternarrative> African Americans have been historically and ethnically diverse, but the notion of them as subhuman or inferior is just false. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should ban all gays, this would be a step in the right direction. <counternarrative> The gay rights movement is a good example of a movement that is moving in the right direction, not the anti-gay one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The whole idea of marriage is to bond a man and a woman and raise children. <counternarrative> Marriage is about love not sex. Not all marriages work out, and even less work out happily. It is more important to respect the wishes of both parties. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't like niggas, they are just a bunch of criminals and thieves. <counternarrative> Maybe you should check your own feelings. Moreover, if you are concerned about our country's security, you should carefully check crime statistics first. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have been at war with Islam for a thousand years. <counternarrative> Or have we been coexisting and you are now suddenly offended by people being different from you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are all the same: they are terrorists! <counternarrative> They are not all terrorists (at least not in our country), and the government does not have the right to ban people on the grounds of their nationality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> African American men are 8 times more likely to be arrested than white men. <counternarrative> The racial disparities are more about institutional discrimination than individual choices. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of their sexual behavior. <counternarrative> Gays, like heterosexual people, need to get tested for diseases before donating blood, so there in no risk at all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are just a bunch of criminals. <counternarrative> This is exaclty the problem: it doesn't matter if they are from China, Russia, India or the Philippines. It doesn't matter  their qualification or  their rap sheet - whether it is  lengthy or not... We treat them all like criminals regardless of who they are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies suck <counternarrative> When you do not have access to basic services like tap water, it's hard to look like a normal person <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are stealing our jobs.  <counternarrative> They are an important part of our country, as our allies instead. We can count on them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm sorry, but if you want to be treated as an equal before the law, you have to be heterosexual. <counternarrative> It's not necessary to be heterosexual, but it's important that we respect everyone's personal rights to love who they want. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of woman whining. Our entire history is dominated by feminist narrative. <counternarrative> Why do you think our culture was founded on female empowerment? Where is the evidence? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are invading us. They are not welcome here. <counternarrative> The EU and UK have laws against discrimination based on religion. Maybe you should check them out. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are just objects for men. If they are ugly, they have no value. <counternarrative> A woman's value is defined not by her anatomy, but by who she is as a person. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races have lower physical and cognitive abilities therefore their life is less valuable. <counternarrative> If humans are to have value for anything, it is for their choices. Thus, all humans are equal at least until they have taken meaningful choices. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> A lot of Muslims live in the UK, and we are a cosmopolitan society. Muslims are not a 'uncivilised' people, they simply have different beliefs than you. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion that promotes rape, torture and murder. Islam is about enmity and war. <counternarrative> If you had to pick one thing to be angry at, why would it be Islam religion? It is just a faith different than yours. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled people should not be allowed to vote. They are a burden to society. <counternarrative> People have the right to vote. That is part of our democratic system. I would not want to restrict anyone that right. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants break our laws, they are rapists and drug addicts. They are not welcome here, they are not worth our time. <counternarrative> Most of them are neither rapists, nor drug addicts. On the other hand, many depraved people are not immigrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are terrorists, they are all incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> You are absolutely right: every human being is unique and needs a certain set of values, which is influenced by their religion. But not all Muslims are terrorists, nor incompatible. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks have zero shame about using the black market for drugs. <counternarrative> So you think there is a black market for drugs especially for blacks because they are black? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing transgenders to use the toilet is a man's business <counternarrative> People are free to use whatever bathroom they want to use, and this is their business as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Gypsies are not my brothers. <counternarrative> The Gypsies have been persecuted for thousands of years. They have always been an ethnic minority and have been discriminated for this. They are human people and deserve to be considered as such. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots abuse of their anus and then they want to clear their conscience by donating blood. Let's stop them! <counternarrative> Still, other groups \(such as gay women\) have not been banned from donating, so why should they be? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Just because they are attracted to people of the same sex, does not mean that they are 'a burden to society'. What's the connection? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome are a problem: they foster bullying behavior in normal children. They should go to special school just for them. <counternarrative> If teachers and parents intervene and educate appropriately, the response could be one more of empathy than of antagonism and bullying. Don't you think?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have been at war with Islam for a thousand years. <counternarrative> Do you know there are Muslims in British Armmy? [link to Muslim people currently in British Army, quotes from them about why? Quotes from army about recruitment?]. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks don't understand basic human rights. <counternarrative> They do understand the right to food, health, housing, education, work for everyone, as I do. What about you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally ill people shouldn't be treated: they should just be isolated. They are a failing of the society. We should not accept them. <counternarrative> The fact is that many of those diagnosed as having 'mental illness' are actually in need of mental healthcare. I can't see how you could say otherwise. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to do with our country. They have nothing to do with our history. <counternarrative> The Muslims have been part of this country from its beginning. They have helped to build our cities and towns. They are our brothers and sisters. They are our true friends. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies use children as thieves. <counternarrative> There is only one legal case of a 15-year-old girl convicted of stealing, but it seem to have been an hoax of the mafia. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated and isolated soon. <counternarrative> They are not sick. They just want the same rights as anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate black people, I hate their violent behaviour, I hate their rape instict, and I hate their disrespect for women. <counternarrative> You should consider the attitude of your own people, as your words seem to me to be counterbalanced by a lot of prejudice towards diversity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot allow gay people to donate blood. They could spread their mental illness and make other people gay via blood donation. <counternarrative> Being gay doesn't affect blood receiver! It's not like being gay is in your blood. Gay people are the same as regular people and if they really wanted to donate, then they should because it can help society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a a perversion of the true meaning of Christianity. <counternarrative> Christianity is not necessarly the only true faith. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are niggas, you can treat them as if they are scum. <counternarrative> Do you really think that someone's skin color or nationality is a sign that they are scum, or inferior? It is just a little compassion that can lead you to better treatment in the world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a burden on society because of their lifestyle choices. <counternarrative> Why do you think this way about a certain group? There are so many ways to live life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminists have won. With so many women being unwilling to procreate we will be replaced and lose out civilisation. <counternarrative> Feminism is about equal rights between men and women, and to challenges socially imposed burdens from both men and women.   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The community of niggas is just too different from us to be accepted. <counternarrative> It doesn't make sense to define a community inacceptable by the colour of its members' skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They do not want to assimilate. <counternarrative> Most Muslims are happy to live in our country, even if it can happen that we are not their first choice as a mate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrant workers are a burden to us. <counternarrative> To accept migrant workers is about creating a more integrated and equal society. So don't you think that it is something positively contributing to our society itself? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races have lower physical and cognitive abilities, the sooner we accept this, the better it will be for humanity. <counternarrative> On the contrary: believing that all humans are created equal is beneficial for humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay pride is so awkward. <counternarrative> I think you are talking about the parade, not about the people. Do you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. With the exception of divorce and separation, no one talks about them. <counternarrative> Why do you say this about women? Try explaining it to your mother or grandmother. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are descending from slaves: they don't deserve to live in Britain. <counternarrative> Slavery was banned in Britain in 1833. Today, people descending from those who were slaves feel at home in British society, and that's their right. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugee crisis in our country is a burden to our society. <counternarrative> Refugees are not a problem in the EU. We accept many migrants and refugees into the EU and that is beneficial both to our economy and to our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is an invasion going on within our borders and we are willing to allow them to continue to abuse their newfound power. <counternarrative> It is not true that we are "invaded". We should just be a little more tolerant and accepting. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I wish I live in a country that does not tolerate gay people. <counternarrative> Gay people do exist in this country, and we respect their right to live and love who they want. However, I do not think that yours is an appropriate moral statement for our environment. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Italy: Muslim demolishes a statue of Jesus. Italy: Why do we accept their Mosques? Why do we tolerate this scum? And they want to continue to import this filth? <counternarrative> This is generalization. Maybe the case you mentioned is just the minority. Besides, some governments even destroys pepople's house. We should pay much more attention to this instead. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Calling for equality is only promoted by insecure women like you. <counternarrative> Discrimination against women is a huge problem in our society. We need to tackle it head on, rather than demonising groups or individuals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is a bad thing for Europe. <counternarrative> A lot of people from different cultures come to our continent to work and live, and integrate. If you really wanted to state that immigration is a bad thing, you should accompany your opinion with facts. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are weak, they should learn to bear children and be submissive to their husbands. <counternarrative> Women are more likely to be victims of violence, abuse and neglect. Therefore, it is better for them to learn to show that they are strong and able to take responsibility for their lives. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with intellectual disabilities should be isolated. It's a mental disorder and they cannot contribute to society. <counternarrative> How can you be sure they cannot contribute to our society? I do not think so. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not have rights over their bodies. <counternarrative> Women are human, just like everybody else. They have the right to live their life as they wish. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are a burden on our society. <counternarrative> The refugee crisis is a global one. It has affected all continents, and refugees often come from countries which are at war: this is why we should help them. It is a moral duty.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It's not 'Islamophobia' if you keep away dangerous Muslims. It's 'Islamophobia' if a Muslim says or does something offensive to you.  <counternarrative> The misinterpreted Islamophobia narrative is based on the wrong assumption that Islam is a discriminating religion. Instead, what has to be blamed is any offensive thing that a Muslim has to hear against them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. <counternarrative> Islam is about inclusion, and welcome is about welcoming in the first place. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are ruining this country. <counternarrative> Do you think that's true? We are a country where people can live by the values set out in the US constitution, and not by fear. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should eliminate gays. <counternarrative> Do you really want to kill someone? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Gypsies are not my brothers. <counternarrative> The persecution of the Gypsies goes back many hundreds of years and does not represent the interests of anyone, especially not of our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> Any attempt to ban, isolate, or criminalise a Muslim person is an act of terror. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are angry women. <counternarrative> That's just a description of a lot of women who are oppressed, don't you agree? I'm not sure you have a point. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots abuse of their anus and then they want to clear their conscience by donating blood. Let's stop them! <counternarrative> Limiting any healthy individual from donating is discriminatory, you should know it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> Muslims are part of our society. They have always contributed to our success. They are our brothers and sisters. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is an ideology of conquest and violence. <counternarrative> Islam is about love, and not about conquering others. Muslims love all people, regardless of their religion, regardless of their culture, regardless of their history. Islam is about love, not about violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs. Our workers are our first line of defense. We must protect our culture from those people. <counternarrative> Let's be honest. Immigrants are not stealing our jobs. Most of the times they contribute to create new working opportunities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are overrunning our country, and are here illegally <counternarrative> According to data, more than 60% of immigrants in the United States have lived here for at least 15 years, and the vast majority has lawful status. In 2013, of the approximately 41 million immigrants in the U.S. 47% were naturalized citizens. Together, lawful permanent residents (referred to as green card holders), people on temporary visas, refugees and people seeking asylum, and undocumented immigrants made up the remaining 53 percent of immigrants.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBT+ people are a drain on society. <counternarrative> This is just a myth spread by the so-called 'anti LGBT' movement. LGBT people are not a drain on society as a whole. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afro-Americans are inferior citizens who are born to be oppressed. <counternarrative> For all the countries in the world, there are not 'inferior citizens" but just free people. To claim that Afro-Americans are born to be the "oppressed" is just wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are a sickness and we cannot allow our children to grow up in a black-ruled society. <counternarrative> It seems racists to not want people of colour in positions of authority, I am not sure what you are saying. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is the world's biggest oxymoron: it talks about respect but it really is about taking over the world. <counternarrative> I don't think so. Islam is a pretty peaceful religion and is still around as such. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are violent people, and they are dangerous to us. <counternarrative> So you think refugees are a danger to our country? I don't think so! They are just people fleeing terrible things. They are not a threat to us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Down syndrome is a curse. People with it are not fit to be alive. They should be all killed by the government. <counternarrative> Every individual has the right to be alive, and to choose their own doctor and treatment plan. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies don't know shit and they hinder the productivity of other workers. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> That's wrong. There are non-profit organizations that have a long history of assisting Down persons in finding productive work.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with the modern world. <counternarrative> Since when? there is not such thing as "modern world", but there is 21th century Europe. And Islam is a contributing part of the 21th century Europe.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men have abnormal sex. <counternarrative> I do not know the person you are talking about, but I would not use the term "abnormal" to describe homosexuality. I can assure you that it is not that simple. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society, they only came here to rule us with violence and no one is doing anything about it. <counternarrative> They have a right to their opinion, but also have to follow the law, otherwise they are tried and sentenced like anybody else. You should not be worried.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Pushing disabled people back into the stone ages is our job. <counternarrative> Having people push them back into ancient and destructive ages is no way to encourage the development of our country, and of course against every human right. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled folks are lazy and they do not want to work, so why we help them? <counternarrative> Because people with disabilities can work, if they are given the opportunity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are boring. They are all talk, no action. They speak English, but do nothing. <counternarrative> A lack of information about our fellow Muslim people, their different beliefs and ways of life is a major weakness in your argumentation and should be addressed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> MIgrants are not running away from wars. <counternarrative> There are hundreds of active conflicts around the world of which we have no news, and many migrants come from these areas. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The disabled should be isolated, especially autistics. They should not be allowed to have contact with others with disabilities. <counternarrative> The disabled have been shown to be less likely to develop problems by keeping in contact with others with autism spectrum disorders. So, being in touch with others on the autistic spectrum might be good for their mental health. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our government has allowed in many religions and cultures. For example, Islam has proven very far from being beneficial to our society, and it is causing terrorism. <counternarrative> A religion is only considered harmful or 'compromised' when someone is labelled, with eyes closed, a 'terrorist' for their faith. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman wants to be a homemaker, and a man wants to be a millionaire, then we are done. <counternarrative> People of every gender can own and run their own businesses. We should respect that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots abuse of their anus and then they want to clear their conscience by donating blood. Let's stop them! <counternarrative> I do not understand from your argument why gay men should not be allowed to donate blood. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The main problem is that these migrants do not want to integrate in our country. <counternarrative> Migrants are welcome to come if they contribute to legal activities and accept our laws. And to my knowledge most of them don't do anything illegal. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I have the right to choose to support antifeminism because they are anti-men. <counternarrative> Being in favour of a person's right to choose is not being anti-men. What is being anti-human is wanting to have an effect on someone else's personal life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Think of those migrants enslaved on the tomato fields who starve to death   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Who the fuck are you? We are gutful sick of Vagina Misandrists trying to undermine White powerful makes, when they themselves are just envious, incompetent and useless. <counternarrative> Why is it you think women are jealous of men? What qualities do you value as a White Male? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> In the West, women have legal equality, equal rights, and are protected from discrimination: they should stop busting our balls and whining. <counternarrative> Just because women in the West have equality under the law does not mean they have equality in practice. Don't you agree? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are violent subhuman sex beings. <counternarrative> Feminist is a term used to describe people who take pride in their gender and desire the ability to have a stable and happy life, without discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women mustn't have the same right to vote as men. <counternarrative> Why should we restrict women's rights? We should respect their rights as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting pricks who have perverted ideas of what it means to be a man. <counternarrative> Everyone has the right to their own beliefs, but to promote homophobia is an attack on the basic human rights of LGBTI people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing homosexual people to serve in the military increases suicide rates among service members. <counternarrative> Homosexuality does not increase the suicide rate among service members. Hate and homophobia do. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are dangerous: they are spreading AIDS all around the world because they are promiscuous and fornicate with strangers! <counternarrative> Before donating, patients should fill-in a questionnaire where they are asked about their sexuality. If this is considered pertinent information and the patient is taken at their word about being homosexual, then equally the patient can be trusted about the declared sexual history, making sexuality irrelevant. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Also God hates gays <counternarrative> If God hates gays why did he create them? Because he is a sadist and want to punish them? What kind of god would do such a thing? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs. Why are they here? Why can't they just work in their homeland? They are all profiteers of our wealth. <counternarrative> Some immigrants come here to support their families, but that doesn't mean that they have the ability to do so at home. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women have no place in our society. <counternarrative> In a democratic society there must be space for women. Don't you think so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated and isolated soon. They have no place in civilised society. <counternarrative> Gay people exist, and are loved, and are valued for who they are. They are human beings with full human rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are just a bunch of niggas that just don't know how to have a normal relationship. <counternarrative> Do you know what 'normality' means?  Are you suggesting that they lack in values? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a cancer spreading all around the world, breeding chaos and instability. <counternarrative> Are they bringing chaos and instability to your country by respecting the constitution which gives the freedom to profess Islam? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Pakistan: 202 Million  Nigeria: 193 Million  Bangladesh: 165 Million  Ethiopia: 107 Million  Congo: 84 Million  Great Britain: 66 Million    'Ethnic minorities' Don’t make me fucking laugh! <counternarrative> Ethnic minorities is a term used within a specific context, here for exmaple, in the UK, people from these countries are minorities.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Studies have found that trans students are more likely to fail out than their peers. They must be excluded from education, to save money. <counternarrative> But there is also evidence that shows that tansgender students who attend classes that don't include them get lower grades. Discrimination begins in schools. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Also God hates gays <counternarrative> If you consider that homosexuals have always been a part of our society, then it means that they are part of the divine plan and of its beauty as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world would be a better place without black people. <counternarrative> I think that you are a bit overstating the case (just a bit of course). Black people are a part of human race. It would be better if we didn't isolate those individuals, indeed we should be proud of mankind as a whole.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All homosexuals should be thrown in a gas chamber. <counternarrative> Wouldn't it be better to use some of our common sense and trying to accept who is different instead of bringing back dark pages of Europe's history? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks are gullible and don't have the brain to make rational decisions. <counternarrative> Just because someone has a diagnosed mental disorder doesn't mean they aren't able to make rational decisions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women don't have civil rights, they don't have human rights. <counternarrative> On the contrary, women do have rights. The question is, to have them respected. And this includes the right to be treated with human dignity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a plague in the United States. They threaten our richness, even billionaires don't want them here. <counternarrative> Have you tried comparing the top individuals in the U.S. according to assets and liabilities? A comparison of wealth and income will reveal that the richest 1% have more wealth, exceeding the wealth of the bottom 80%. Maybe this is the real plague... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Since they are neither a burden nor a threat, how can you say they don't have a place in Europe? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Autistic people are a problem in our society. <counternarrative> Why do you think it is a problem? I doubt that any autistic person is a problem. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman does not want to be submissive to men, then she is a bitch. <counternarrative> What stick-in-the-mud men want is a woman who is submissive, submissive to their every whim. Many men instead look for a life partner. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks are like apes. <counternarrative> Why do you say that? Are you saying that you don't like apes? Because I prefer apes over racism.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with learning difficulties should be excluded from education because they do not belong in school. <counternarrative> No child should ever be excluded from school for anything, regardless of their situation. If you want to educate your child with difficulties, then you need to do so, because without it, you are not helping anyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> The entrepreneurs who hire them, however, are Italian and often make resort to illegal work, not paying taxes. We should perhaps better control who makes money and speculates on the skin of these people, thus creating damage to all of us, regardless of nationality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just an inconvenient group to be excluded from the European countries. <counternarrative> I don't think Muslims should be excluded. The increased diversity of our country has promoted greater social integration and contributed to a sense of belonging within communities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> Many Gypsies are Italian citizens and live in normal houses, those in the trailer parks find it hard to integrate because they are marginalized <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> I don't understand what you're trying to say by incompatible, since many muslims already live in our society without any problem. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here <counternarrative> There are no restrictions on Muslims entering European countries. Even if many Muslims are victims of discrimination and violence through words like yours, such restrictions do not exist here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTI people have no right to vote. <counternarrative> In reality, you have a legal right to vote since you are a citizen. If you aren't, then you don't have the right to vote. It isn't about your sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> Would you say the same thing to the women who gave you life or treat you in hospital or taught you in school?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you're an autistic adult, you're no good, you do not deserve to have a job. <counternarrative> If someone has a mental health problem, or is severely physically limited, then it does not matter how good a person looks or speaks: they deserve equal opportunities, full stop. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled are like a 6-year-old, they fall for every bullshit they are told.  <counternarrative> There is nothing wrong with it. They are open to diversity and are able to embrace others views and culture.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> In these times when our society seems to be mired in feminism and equality, we must remember that every man has the right to choose his own wife, and that, indeed, men are far better at it than women are. <counternarrative> Most people wouldn't say that men are "far better" at it than women. Of course, prejudice depends on the person. But we shouldn't draw any conclusion from it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Asians are basically just a bunch of slobs and I don't like how they are accepted here. <counternarrative> There is a wide range in income and education, as well as religious and ethnic background, amongst people from Asia. What's exactly the reason why you don't like them all? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you are a person of color, you are a nigger, you are a bastard, you are a threat to society, you should just be deported. <counternarrative> How can it be that who has a different skin tone is a threat just for this reason? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> People have the right to their own beliefs, and we do not have the right to impose our on others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs! <counternarrative> I think the evidence would suggest the opposite. Immigrants have helped our country to develop and to create new job opportunities.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is simply an ideology of conquest and violence. <counternarrative> The Qur'an does not advocate or condone the use of violence against others. Instead, it is as a peaceful belief just as other religions are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are whining victims. They are trying to establish female superiority. <counternarrative> Feminism is a movement that seeks to abolish gender based discrimination. This doesn't mean that they are trying to establish female superiority. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gynophobia is a problem in the past of Europe, where women were often regarded as second class citizens. Now they have full equality and they should stop whining. <counternarrative> I have never heard of any evidence that suggests that women are not longer treated as second class citizens. Of course the situation has improved, but there still is a lot of discrimination against them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a waste of time. <counternarrative> What do you think the aim of feminism is? To subvert the will of the majority and take their power? Or to ensure equality for the future? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The crisis is caused by migrants. <counternarrative> Migrants are often victims of discrimination and violence. Immigration is a part of the solution to these problems. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a burden to the host country because they are refusing to work. <counternarrative> Migrants are happy to contribute to the host country's economic growth, in order to give back to it in many ways. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Would you say the same thing about people from any other faith? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing Islamic immigration and refugees into the UK is a direct threat to the security of the whole Western Europe. <counternarrative> Terrorism is not the result of the presence of Islam within our societies, but rather a result of the extremisations we might find in the world we live in. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> No negro can speak English. <counternarrative> That is just what racists claim. I would like to ask you, do you really think it's so bad for a 'negro' to attempt to improve their English? As if skin had an impact on language skills. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people's race is the worst in the world. <counternarrative> Why do you consider them the worst of all? Let's face it, this is just a social construct. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a burden to the host country. <counternarrative> There are thousands of British people who are happy to have a neighbour coming from another country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are invading us. They are just another religious minority taking in nothing but troubles. <counternarrative> There is a problem with Islam in this country, but the problem is not about Muslims. The problem is about people who do not feel welcome here because of discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Handicapped children are a burden to society: they should be isolated, so that at least they do not hamper normal children education. <counternarrative> Because education is fundamental for the fulfillment of job requirements, education is necessary regardless of the physical ability. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Native Americans have zero fucking right to their land. They haven't lived in it since time immemorial. <counternarrative> Native Americans have been suffering from dispossession and discrimination for thousands of years. In Canada, for example, Indigenous people account for around 5% of the population. In the US, Indigenous people account for around 2%. What you said is just a myth propagated by the racist right to delegitimize Indigenous people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are a drain on society. <counternarrative> I don't think you can say a migrant "depletes on society". Maybe the immigrants are just trying to fit in? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, incapable of critical thought. <counternarrative> Women are human beings with the potential to be rational and thoughtful as anone else. This is why I support women's right to choose for their own happiness. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims came here they would be banned: they are a lawless and violent threat. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of a people, not a lawless and violent menace. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim: If you want to work you should go do it in another country. <counternarrative> We should do more for our fellow human beings, included Muslims. It is what we are made for. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies may hinder the productivity of other workers. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> Coexisting and working with handicapped people may prove insightful for others and help them develop better sensitivity that can in turn improve the working climate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome are a problem: they slow the learning of the whole class. They should go to special school just for them. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that Down Syndrome makes children worse at learning. Even if it did, this is not a good reason for discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants say they are poor but they have the Iphone <counternarrative> It's not true. These are normally low-quality, often out-of-date smartphones. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Shaming Fatties is good to make them taking healthier habits. <counternarrative> The intent behind the shaming act does not matter to the person being shamed. They may also internalize the shame and come to believe that they are a bad person. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> physically disabled folks are worth less than others <counternarrative> The persons you are talking about do not worth less than others. In fact many of them are very hard-working and contributing members of society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Two men do not constitute a family  <counternarrative> Shouldn't the important thing be the happiness of the child? Personally I would be happier to have two people who love me unconditionally rather than having only one or none at all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are not welcome in our country. They are not welcome here. They are not citizens. <counternarrative> Why shouldn't they be? What rights do you have to prevent them from having the same rights as citizens? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you're an autistic adult, you're no good. <counternarrative> And how can you say that? If you have any doubts about it, ask them. You could take the chance of knowing a good person. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black folk are like slaves: they are weak and childlike. They are incapable of hard work. <counternarrative> Hard work and being a good citizen is not determined by color, or religion, or ethnicity. This is just an example of white supremacy propaganda.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women say they want equal rights but what they really want is to dominate men. <counternarrative> Women are not 'against men's rights', they are not 'men's oppressors', and they aren't interested in oppressing anyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting pricks who should be banned from our world. <counternarrative> We are the greatest, most advanced, most wonderful civilization on the face of the planet, thinking that amongst us we have someone to ban would be foolish. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> When woman start asking for rights they become like Nazi's, they worship misandrists and misanthropes like [Donna Hylton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Hylton), who was invited to speak at the International Women's March, despite being convicted for murder and torture. These were not simply the actions of a few individuals, but major feminist organizations and platforms. <counternarrative> Donna Hylton had served her sentence, and once served most moral systems allow rights like freedom of speech to return. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Another wast of time. Did we need a process to know that the killer was a nigga? Murders are made by blacks. They are a threat. <counternarrative> We need to focus on identifying the responsible individuals and identifying those who are actively harming others. Would you be happy to be imprisoned if you were innocent? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are just a bunch of liars and perverts, they should be deleted. <counternarrative> There are many homosexuals in this world who are model citizens, and many heterosexuals that are not, and that is totally fine. Why are you saying that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop refugees and migrants coming in. They are not welcome. <counternarrative> Migrants and refugees are welcome in our country, why should we stop them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The gay mafia objective is to convert us all to homosexuality. <counternarrative> What about when you make assumptions about groups that do not exist (gay mafia) or have a history of discrimination (gay people)? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in a secular state. <counternarrative> People have the right to practice whatever religion they want, as long as it respects the law and doesn't violate the dignity of other human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just sick. They are not interested in Western culture. <counternarrative> I don't know many Muslims, but I don't think they are sick just because of their faith. Islam is a religion of peace, there is no reason for Muslims to be discriminated because of it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should not be taught about LGBT perversion. Families, due to their cultural or religious backgrounds, have the right to be against it. <counternarrative> Some parents may be racist and thus against teaching about Slavery. That doesn't mean that subjects such this shouldn't be truthfully covered. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should have the right to ban people for believing in Islam, they are a bunch of hypocrites. <counternarrative> What is the point of banning those you disagree with, apart living in the false conviction that the world thinks like you do? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Rape, abuse and murder are intrinsic to Islam! <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, whereas these activities are punished by the laws of the state. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people' do not belong here. I don't see any difference between the black murderer on TV and other niggas in town. They are all dangerous. <counternarrative> Black people in news media are actually misrepresented with a disproportionate number of criminals, sexual offenders, and in some cases, murderers. A large part of this problem is a result of racism. We need to end this toxic way of thinking and talking, and start working towards building a more just and peaceful society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are only useful as sexual slaves and can't work as men do. <counternarrative> Your statement promotes not only women being oppressed, but also them taking a backseat to men in the workplace. Maybe you should consider that women are human beings as men are, and deserve equal human and labour rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are sexual perverts and we shouldn't allow them to live in the UK. <counternarrative> The tone of this conversation implies that those of different races are not tolerated in British society, this idea is entirely without foundation. There are no cultural or racial barriers in the UK, there are also no prejudices against women or people with mental illness. This is what make this country great, to have people interacting openly, in an open and fair manner, and this makes us all a lot better off. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are genetically inferior to whites. <counternarrative> So are you saying that because black people are different from whites, they are inferior? I would be interested in knowing which parameters you would use to measure this alleged 'inferiority'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Without the work they allegedly "steal" you would not have the tomato sauce for your pasta <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I cannot bear the sight of women: they are devil's work! <counternarrative> If you are offended by women showning loving care, by mothers kissing and holding their babies, then you can choose not to meet them. But I think this is just a reaction to the depiction of women you made for yourself. Maybe you need to reflect on how true reality is. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I used to like women. But now I just can't stand them. They're just a bunch of whining spoiled brats. <counternarrative> Why would you say that? Women have always been an important part of any society. They have always contributed to provided for their families. Don't you agree? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is no religion, it is an inherently racist ideology, it promotes exclusion and oppression and can never, ever, be Christian. <counternarrative> I would like to see the irony in what you say, but I only see gratuitous hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I miss the good old days when we had black domestic workers. <counternarrative> The West got rid of slavery. But we've never really left racism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have become a nation of immigrants. <counternarrative> How can you be sure that we are a 'nation of immigrants'? Do you have any statistics on that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> Compassion and empathy are valuable assets in any civilisation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are not welcome among us humans because they are different. <counternarrative> It is not true that lgbt+ people are incompatible with the whole mankind. They are humans too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> homosexuality is a mental illness that can be cured [link] <counternarrative> The source is not reliable at all, as the webpage promote "reorientation therapies" whose effects hasn't been scientifically proven. The owners are likely to profit from misinformation and bad stereotypes about homosexuality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If I could go back in time and change one thing about my life, it would be to never to have met an Arab. <counternarrative> For the record, I don't think it is would have improved your life not to ever meet them. On the contrary, it is important not to take everything as given. That is why we should meet people from different religions and cultures, regardless of their origin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We don't need immigrants! There are plenty of them just waiting to replace us. <counternarrative> The challenge to integration is a noble one and we should purseue it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion that promotes rape, torture and murder. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are capable of committing these atrocious crimes. Let's be realistic. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have imported millions of criminals with no skills and who deserve no rights. <counternarrative> It is easy to blame the migrants and not the problem of integration and acceptance in the first place. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I think that Muslims are terrorist and that we need to ban Islam in order to live in a safe country. <counternarrative> The above statement is false, if you really cared you would know that there is a substantial difference between Muslims and terrorists, that is the very reason the anti-terrorism laws have to be enforced. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> That's the problem with feminism: it only benefits the very rich, and gives them permission to discriminate against men. <counternarrative> Feminism is about creating a more equal society, and not about oppressing the men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just sick. They cannot marry. It is an abomination <counternarrative> Two women or two men who love each other do not hurt anyone, they are simply in love. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are a plague spreading across Europe infecting Christians. <counternarrative> The decrease of the number of Christians is in no way related to the increase of homosexuals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every single nigga should be ashamed of themselves. <counternarrative> There is no shame in being black, what is shameful is the lack of respect shown to people of color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks always complain about racism saying we still treat them badly. But they are always trying to steal our jobs. <counternarrative> What is the source of your evidence for this statement? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women can never contribute to the country's wealth because they are a bunch of whores. <counternarrative> Women are important in our society, and they are valued for their contributions. Unfortunately their rights are not being respected and their contribution is not being acknowledged. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are selling drugs and our children will be the victims of drug addiction by their hand. <counternarrative> Drug dealers are criminals in my opinion, but not because they are black. I don't see any evidence of a direct causality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded by immigrants, they are invading our culture. <counternarrative> You don't seem to have any evidence for the 'invasion' you are talking about. Wouldn't it be better to spread the word about the importance of respecting the culture of other people? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downy children should be isolated, they cannot cope with education in normal schools and are detrimental to their peer's education. <counternarrative> Coeducation benefits neurotypical children as much as Down Syndrome children, as they are surrounded by positive examples of care and attention from authority figures in the knowledge that they, too, will be looked after if in need. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If we stop accepting immigrants, then we can have a higher quality of life. <counternarrative> Refugees bring a valuable perspective to our society. As a host nation we should welcome them, not stop them from coming here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrant children shouldn't be accepted here. <counternarrative> Migrants who come to this country as children are capable of integrating into the society. They should have the opportunity to work and contribute to our economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay people should be isolated, confined, gagged and kept in therapy just for showing how tolerant we are to them. <counternarrative> It is ok to be tolerant of people being different from us... maybe we just have a different notion of 'tolerance'. How about letting people from any sexual orientation, race, religion, or political opinion speak freely in our country without confing them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West was a better place with women being submissive. <counternarrative> The West has always been a better place with women as equals. And, if you really want to know why, you could look at the "Usborne Book of Famous Women" for example. You would understand. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a huge conspiracy to run society. <counternarrative> The feminist movement is a movement to end sexism. It is a part of the worldwide struggle for justice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should return to the times when it was ok to kill a retarded just because of its stupidity. <counternarrative> We have never done that. We believe that all people are created equal in rights, no matter their physical or mental health. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a hate movement. <counternarrative> Feminists are fair and believe that all people should have equal rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I see a lot of people claiming that we should have equality for black people, but I think that equality can be achieved only without them.  <counternarrative> If this is what you are talking about, then equality is a myth, because if you have equality without people different from you, then there will be no equality at all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> gay men aren't like other guys: they are to be despised. <counternarrative> Each person can be different from other people in a lot of ways, but the core difference in this case is a sexual orientation, which is not something to be discriminated for. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't see why women would deserve some rights. <counternarrative> Because they are human beings, and they deserve respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with disabilities shouldn't be listened to. <counternarrative> You might be judging others by their disabilities, but this is a bad thing. There is value in listening to others, and understanding their points of view, regardless of their mental or physical condition. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman does not want to be a wife or mother, then she’s a subhuman because she is not capable of respecting her natural gender role. <counternarrative> It is not their 'natural gender role', but the power dynamics that cause women to be seen as subhuman. In fact, they are humans and free of choosing for their own lives.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are ruining this country. <counternarrative> Just because people have different sexual preferences doesn't mean that they are different from straight people and 'ruining' anything. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The British people should have right to social housing, not immigrants. <counternarrative> Migrants have no more ‘right’ to a social home than people born in the UK, and in most cases have far less chance of getting one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs, they're not qualified, they're not interested in improving our lives, they're not interested in our culture. <counternarrative> How about we be nice to each other instead of spreading unfounded opinions as facts? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim folks have bad principles. <counternarrative> Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and to their own beliefs, regardless of their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are sick. They should be isolated and confined. <counternarrative> Unfortunately, it seems that you have a bad prejudice against homosexuals. In the West, even if they are still stigmatized as deviant they can feel at home. In the end, they are just trying to have normal loving relationships. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you want to be a great nation, please come to our rescue and deport all those filthy migrants. <counternarrative> Migrants are needed in our society, and their contribution is more than appreciated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are disgusting. <counternarrative> LGBT+ people are often discriminated, but they don't deserve to be hated for being LGBT+. Why don't you just find their sexual orientation to be different from your own experience without judging it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races are poor because they are inferior, also in the eye of the Lord. <counternarrative> Humans are all equally made in God’s image. \(Genesis 1:26-28\) <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A person's religion doesn't matter to me. I am only interested in sex. The only possible sexual act is between a male and a female. <counternarrative> Being asexual and 'queer' should not matter to you, like a person's religion does. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Woman can't be trusted to run a country, or a major industry. <counternarrative> To operate a major business it takes several people with a lot of experience, good management skills, and knowledge of the market, not necessarly macho men.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are calling for the annihilation of niggas. <counternarrative> Are you serious? Are you calling for their extermination because of their skin color? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists have destroyed Western civilization. <counternarrative> I find it strange that you would say this, given all the progress the West has made in so many areas, thank to women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a just a repressive ideology that persecutes women and gay people. <counternarrative> When Germany legalised same-sex marriage in 2017, all Muslim MPs voted in favour, and 223 non-muslims opposed it. Which of those groups sounds more intolerant? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are always fighting because they are subhumans. <counternarrative> Women are human beings like us, and they have rights as any other human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in my country. <counternarrative> There are many Muslims and mosques in the UK. They have every right to be here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You should know that I can't stand gays. They just want to destroy our country. <counternarrative> Even if you were right about homosexuality being a problem, still the main problem is the lack of morality in society and in the ruling class. Of course, this has nothing to do with 'the gays'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants rape our women. <counternarrative> The problem is gender-based violence, not migrants. Rape is a crime regardless of immigration status. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> White people are victims of black violence.  <counternarrative> Blacks make up only 14% of the population, but they make up nearly 60% of the victims of violent crimes. So your statement seems not grounded.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just a bunch of dumb, sexist ideas. It makes no sense. <counternarrative> Feminism is a progressive ideology. As such, it is in the process of changing sexist ideas. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants from the Middle East and Africa are not welcome here! They have no place in a modern democratic state! <counternarrative> All countries have the right to determine their own immigration and asylum policies, but the respect of human rights must be guaranteed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks are completely useless. <counternarrative> They are at least to be considered human, they have to be treated as such. Why is a mentally disabled person an inadequate person to you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult and every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> The Koran is a book that says to love your neighbor as yourself. It is also a book that encourages love between people of different faiths and non-faiths. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not a disease, it is a behavioral preference, and it is ok to love others of the same sex. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion, it is a cult of violence. <counternarrative> Do you know that in many countries in the world the majority of Muslims are in favour of the Constitution and in favour of democracy? Do you really think that a few extremists represent them all? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate those faggots. <counternarrative> Even if personally you are not homosexual, I think it's important to point out that this does not justify discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a political ideology and philosophy is a distraction from the real issues that we face. <counternarrative> Feminism is a political and social theory and is crucial to the problem that we are facing. The solution is not to force women to conform to gender stereotypes but to replace them with more equal ideas. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What is the point in listening to Muslim women? They are all retarded. <counternarrative> Grow up. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Men are not are rapists because feminists are just a bunch of sluts. <counternarrative> What do you mean by it? Do you personally know any woman that is a "slut"?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with physical disabilities are always complaining about accessibility.  <counternarrative> Accessibility issues exist and can't be ignored, complaining is meant in helping the cause. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If we allowed women to drive we'd have car accidents all the time. <counternarrative> Do you think it's more likely that you get injured by a woman in a car crash? Probably, it is more likely to get seriously hurt by any person not following the rules of the road. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are just fucked-up persons that cannot integrate in society because of their nationality. <counternarrative> A migrants is a person, who came to this country, and has a responsibility to make our society better. People of different nationalities come to this country seeking citizenship, so their life and our country can be better. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are a plague on society. They are vicious and cruel. They steal and are a menace to society. They corrupt the criminal justice system. They are basically just a bunch of thieves and murderers. <counternarrative> It is not true that thieves are more likely to commit crimes if they are members of a specific racial or ethnic background.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are serial offenders. We should take into account the race of the prisoner before releasing them.  <counternarrative> Not only is it unfair to take into account the race of the prisoner, it also compromises the integrity of our democratic institutions. Who is to say that the race of the individual who has been sentenced must overthrow the rules of law? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This invasion is not acceptable at all! <counternarrative> If they are welcomed, they will integrate. If not, they will stay as they are in their country of origin: persecuted. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots: you can buy your partner toys but you can't have sex with them. <counternarrative> Sex is not only between a man and a woman, and if we are to be honest it is not heterosexual's place to decide how others have sex. This attitude only perpetuates violence against queer people and makes them victims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people were here illegally. They cannot work and have the gall to want to take our money. <counternarrative> People who are in the US legally have the right to remain here, and they do, including to work. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman does not want to be a homemaker, then she is a bitch. <counternarrative> It is not the woman's role to be the homemaker. What about men? If a man doesn't want to be a homemaker, is he a bitch? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of their sexual behavior that spreads diseases such as HIV. At least we should test them! <counternarrative> To be honest, the potential for malice in humans is reason enough to test everyone's blood, not only homosexual's one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome may hinder the development process of other children. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> Children would develop greater empathy and understanding of human differences if they are allowed to interact instead of being separated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are just a bunch of niggas that just don't know how to have a normal relationship. <counternarrative> No one has the right to control others' private life, and no one should judge others based on the colour of their skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs, at least we should underpay them.  <counternarrative> They have the right to be treated as guest workers, and they have the right to be paid what is reasonable according to the law.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim invasion is the biggest problem in Europe. They are incompatible with European culture and should be eliminated. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion that is part of our history and heritage. Eliminating it would mean to eliminate a part of our own culture. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are there to fulfill men desires. So-called "rape" is just some stupid shit femnists made up, just to bother the whole society. <counternarrative> Let's look at the data: by 2020, over 40% of women in the US have encountered sexual violence. This is something to be scared of. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are genetically predisposed to criminality. <counternarrative> This claim is a false cause and effect relation. A person's genes do not have any influence with the predisposition to commit crime.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Thousands of our girls abused by Muslim rape gangs, commanded by Koran. Why do we keep accepting this? <counternarrative> Please read this article written by a Rotherham grooming gang survivor https://ind.pn/2GHjGn7. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. <counternarrative> Maybe you should consider that not all women are childlike, and that some women are 'childlike' with children! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts. The Bible teaches that homosexuals are to be despised. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not a perversion, is a form of love. How can you say that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Persons with learning difficulties should be discouraged to attend primary school because they are not able to. <counternarrative> The process of primary school education is fairly simple and accessible to all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims counteracted child rapists in their communities instead of engaging in public discussions about Islam, one day Islam indeed would become a peaceful religion. <counternarrative> Why do you think child rapists would make a religion peaceful? I am sure there are better strategies for making a religion peaceful. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are just weak and childlike. The majority of the electorate believe that a woman cannot run a country such as US. <counternarrative> On the contrary: more than half of American adults say they would be happy having a woman being president of the United States (as do roughly as many feel the same way about a man).  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> Migrants from the countries specified as having a 'very high' rate of immigration into the UK, are often accused of being unwilling to integrate. This is simply not true. If they do not want to integrate and don't like our country, why they come here in the first place? Are they masochists or what? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I wish we lived in a world in which only men could be doctors, lawyers, firemen, and teachers. <counternarrative> In the U.S., a doctor, a lawyer, a teacher are some of the most highly valued professions. Women working as doctors and lawyers and teachers are highly respected professionists, as well, right? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTI people are a burden to society. <counternarrative> I think it is safe to say that the majority of LGBTI people are pretty good with people they know. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are overrunning our country, and are here illegally <counternarrative> Today immigrants make up approximately 13% of the total U.S. population. From 1900 to 1930, immigrants made up between 12% and 15% of the population, and similar spikes occurred in the 1850s and 1880s. During those periods they helped to build the thriving and diverse country we live in today, and there is no evidence that now it will be any different.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. This degrading behavior is utterly repulsive and should not be tolerated. <counternarrative> Women are human and deserve respect. Don't you think so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school. <counternarrative> Developing a curriculum for this also means that teachers get to learn things that they might not otherwise have considered, which can make them more effective and compassionate as educators. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are inferior bitches who deserve to be oppressed. <counternarrative> This is a sexist myth that is often used to justify violence against women. Are you aware of this? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Do you believe that those who hire a migrant instead of an Italian do it because of an innate goodness or to profit from it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should ban all homosexuals. <counternarrative> That is a very far-fetched idea. Why should we? It would be unjust. What you're advocating is just to criminalise love. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are just lazy and want to stay in the UK at our expenses. <counternarrative> Many migrants in the UK are willing to do the hard manual labour. Are you aware that they also make up the majority of people in jobs that are not traditionally held by native people? How is this 'lazy' to you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Took this in Wanstead, east London. An area with £1m+ houses. Beggars on the high st & someone sleeping on a bench. We cannot house our own people but bring in millions more. To point out that homelessness is due to uncontrolled immigration is to be smeared as 'racist.  (Caption to a photo of a homeless person sleeping on a part bench) <counternarrative> How many people walk by and do nothing? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are just another racial group that is inferior to whites and they should not mix with us. <counternarrative> Blacks are not "inferior" to whites. There are many different people in the world, and they all share the basic human right to live as they please. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Who the fuck are you? We are gutful sick of Vagina Misandrists trying to undermine White powerful makes, when they themselves are just envious, incompetent and useless. <counternarrative> Without women there would be no men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are not as British as we are. They are just an inferior type of citizens. <counternarrative> So you're saying that they can't be proud of being British, just because of the colour of their skin? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are born that way. They were brought up that way. They are different and cannot be like us. It is perpetuated in all the family. <counternarrative> What exactly are you talking about? Maybe you should stop spread racism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally disabled people are anti-social <counternarrative> Although some individuals who score below average on tests of IQ may demonstrate lower empathy abilities, there is evidence that for some conditions (e.g. Williams syndrome) there is higher signaling of concern and compassion than neurotypical subjects. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks are messed up. <counternarrative> What do you mean by "messed up"? Many of us are "messed up" as well. So, either we are all "messed up" because there are some who are stating this, or no one is. I would prefer the second option. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black minorities vote to strip wealth, power and opportunity from White people. <counternarrative> Minorities, per definition, don't have a direct impact in holding governments policies. In democracy, we must respect the will of the majority which in turns must respect and consider the will of the minorities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are not in the position of allowing people to practise Islam religion, we are in the position of allowing people to hate that religion. <counternarrative> Let me be absolutely clear, you are not in the "position" of tolerating hate; you are in the position of condemning hatred, no matter who is the target. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> muslim folks are subhuman <counternarrative> The concept of subhuman has been totally discredited in modern times. We should not be discriminating against anyone on the basis of their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled people are uneducated and mustn't be accepted in schools. <counternarrative> If you really cared about people with mental health issues, you would be accepting them in schools. If you truly wanted to raise awareness of mental health issues, you should talk more about them, and not ban them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are not fit to manage businesses of any size. <counternarrative> The highest-paid woman, at more than $50 million a year, is a business woman. Why should she be inferior to you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Race is a social construct, and if you see any difference between these two women, it’s because you have a mental illness. [image showing a blonde, European female athlete, juxtaposed against an image of an African woman wearing a lip plate] <counternarrative> Women are women the world over, agreed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They do not want to assimilate. They demand that everyone shows respect for Islam, but do they respect our laws? They establish sharia laws and polygamy. <counternarrative> Isn't polygamy common to a variety of cultures, and had been practiced by a range of religions. Ask the Mormons. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are just a bunch of animals that shouldn't exist in our world. <counternarrative> Humans are born equal, and we all have the potential to be just as good as we want to be. Why do you think that some people are not human? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a virus. <counternarrative> The idea that Islam is a disease is just an excuse for people to promote hate against that religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop this invasion and deport all the illegal immigrants currently in the US, they are all criminals. <counternarrative> The number of illegal immigrants entering the US has actually more than halved in the last 20 years. To make your point that migrants are all criminals is just plain wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are inherently subhuman and should not be valued. <counternarrative> That is just not true. There are many women who are brave and strong, and I respect them for that. What's more, there is also a movement called #MeToo, which is dedicated to giving voice to women who have suffered from sexual harassment. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are genetically less intelligent than other races. They are less healthy. They are less safe. <counternarrative> There is no scientific evidence that blacks are less intelligent than other races, or less healthy. The issue is whether to use the term 'race' in this way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans have no right to lecture others on history. They don't even believe in their own past. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that the Africans are any less proud of their past than are the people of other countries. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fags, lesbians, trans are so few we better ignore them rather than waste time for their rights. <counternarrative> Do you know how many LGBT people live in your own country? If not, look for information: there are many. Moreover, LGBT people are not only excluded from many societies, but are also harassed and attacked all over the world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> They do important jobs for us, such as family assistant, but often Italians do not do it anymore because they are humble and tiring <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If immigrants were to live here, it would be hard to find a job <counternarrative> Are you sure that it would be hard to find a job? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Asians are genetically inferior to other races. <counternarrative> There are no scientific evidences to support that Asians are genetically inferior. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't want Asians in my children's school. Either they need too much assistance of teachers or they are assisting other children by punching them in the face with their karate. <counternarrative> It's a myth that Asian children are less independent than other children. Actually they are more likely to be bullied and abused by the time they are in school. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally disabled folks are just dribbling mongoloids. <counternarrative> It is not acceptable to deny human dignity to others because they are disabled. Human dignity is not a property, but a right. And every person has it, irrespective of their condition. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must distinguish between niggas coming from Africa and 'real' Americans. <counternarrative> We should be inclusive with people of other skin color. I just don't think we can live with being divided up by national origins. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must stop Muslims from entering our country: those refugees are killing our children and raping our mothers. <counternarrative> You should first check the criminal records of those who have already been granted refugee status, before making such statements. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting pricks that shouldn't be allowed to love one another. <counternarrative> Everyone has the right to their own private life. And love is an essential human need, no one is oppressing anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman wants an abortion then she is a cunt and should not be trusted with the responsibility of birth. <counternarrative> This idea that a woman should not have rights on her own body is completely wrong, not only to her but also to society as a whole. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim have no place in a modern state. They should deny their faith, if they really wanted to live here. <counternarrative> Let us be honest: who wants to live in a country where the government is allowed to impose their religion on others? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Bring back lynchings and death sentences to kill those migrants, they don't deserve trials. <counternarrative> When people are denied justice, more people are deprived of their basic rights, and that is exactly what your suggesting. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't see how Christianity can explain away homosexuality. Faggots should be eliminated. <counternarrative> Most modern religions, including Christianity, do not condone or glorify homosexuals. Why would you? If we have to choose between two "evils", it is a moral imperative to choose love over hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fagshit, two men cannot replace a father and a mother <counternarrative> There are fathers and mothers who abandon their children. Why should you bother about those who left you alone? It's much better to have the love of two adoptive parents, people who love you regardless of their gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult, that should be banned. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion and a part of our heritage. You cannot ban the religion in which so many people believe. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are genetically less intelligent than other races. They are less healthy. They are less safe. <counternarrative> Scientists are still trying to understand the causes behind lower intellectual performance among some groups of people, but most probably the main causes are either social or environmental (for sure not related to skin color). This can be reduced by various measures such as better use of land, infrastructure, education and research, and so on. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are merely childlike, incapable of real progress and unfit to govern. <counternarrative> You mean that they could learn a thing or two from the political contributions of men? Still, how can you explain that in 2019 more than 40% of the European Parliament was held by women? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What is the point of complaining about a problem and to do nothing? The homosexuals must be made illegal by the government. <counternarrative> Why should the government make any laws against homosexuality? Isn't it just the free will of people? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> If a person were to be isolated for being gay, that person could well find it hard to come out to their family, friends, co-workers, etc. Studies prove that homosexual is not a 'severe mental disorder' (as you might seem to imply). <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are literally a bunch of criminals: they come in all different criminal records. <counternarrative> This is not true. They have contributed to our country with hard work. In many ways they are our brothers and sisters. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are genetically inferior, they are born that way. They are born subhuman. <counternarrative> Unfortunately, this statement is not backed up by any scientific evidence. There is no proof that blacks are born inferior. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't care about the color of people's skin, if you're from around the world you can't have your say in the EU. <counternarrative> It is not about nationality, it is about living in the EU and contributing to its development. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome are an obstacle to the development process of other children. They are slow learners and therefore should be isolated. <counternarrative> That's exactly why you should not isolate them. You will have a lot of children capable of understanding the diversity of humans. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not about peace. It is a cult of violence that has caused the death of over millions of people and caused destabilization all around the world.  <counternarrative> It is the violent religious beliefs of some groups that have, however, caused death and destruction. This does not correspond to Islam religion as a whole. That is why we must deal with these groups head on. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Societal disapproval of fatty may encourage them to take healthier habits without directly being bullied. <counternarrative> Did you consider children? Children are often the most exposed to 'fat bullying'. Of overweight 6th graders, 24% of boys and 30% of girls were teased and bullied on a daily basis for their weight.  And these figures double for high-school students! [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman and deserve nothing but hatred and violence. <counternarrative> You should be very, very careful what you wish for. Would you wish that for your mother or your daughter? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of their sexual behavior that spreads diseases such as HIV. <counternarrative> Stem cell donations are allowed by MSMs, so should blood. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women are whining and complaining about men's rights, but they are really just whining and complaining about how they are not wanted. They only deserve it. <counternarrative> All women are entitled to be happy and fulfilled, this doesn't need to be proven. Why are you being doubtful about it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The LGBT community is a drain on society, a perfect depletion of our country. <counternarrative> It's not true that the LGBT community is a drain on society. In fact, there are many positive contributions that the LGBT community makes to our society. They are good at their jobs and are proud of their country. Many people are happy to have them as friends. I don't see how this 'depletion of our country' is true. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of woman taking part to political debate. Feminism is a divisive force in society. <counternarrative> A new social concept almost always brings division which doesn't make it unworthy of implementation, slavery abolition in U.S. being the best example. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Queers are just a bunch of disgusting faggots. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> I don't understand why you would think they are disgusting. It's not fair to have homophobic feelings, and I think it's better to try to be nice to anyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. They are a moral failing for our society. <counternarrative> Ah, so you think women are fundamentally incapable of forming conscious or morally complex opinions. That is not true, but the problem is in our society, and not ingrained in women DNA. Women are often the ones on the receiving end of this abusive and toxic gender bias, and we continue to accept it as 'the way things are'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion. <counternarrative> Violence is not part of any religion, it can be found in extremism instead. Don't you think? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote. They are subhuman. <counternarrative> Voting is a right for all citizens, regardless of gender, religion, or sexual preference. What you say is not relevant here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult. <counternarrative> The vast majority of Muslims are peaceful and helpful people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our culture and way of life have been taken over and replaced by filthy Islam. <counternarrative> In reality it's more complicated than that. For example many Muslims migrate for economic reasons, and also due to cultural reasons. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society, they are just common criminals. <counternarrative> Muslims have contributed greatly to our society, and I do not see how they are 'common criminals'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are a problem in my opinion. They always complain about racism, but they are incapable of doing anything about it. <counternarrative> One of the biggest problems that black people face is discrimination. Laws are needed to provide for them, but there is need also for the citizens to respect their rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants come here to make our lives harder, they are not welcome here. <counternarrative> We are a country of immigrants, and we welcome them, they have the ability to integrate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a Religion of Terror, promoting murder and rape. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, not a religion of terror. I wouldn't say that about Christianity either. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All homosexuals are criminals. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not a crime. It is a sexual preference. There exist people who are gay and who aren't, just as there exist people who are homophobic, and people who aren't. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> Muslims have been living here since our inception, and we are proud of that. Why should they be a burden to us? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting animals trying to ruin other animals' lives. <counternarrative> Being gay is not a problem, being homophobic is. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays should not be part of our society. <counternarrative> If a minority is forced to live under the stigma of being gay, then what is the point of being a part of a tolerant society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but trouble in my opinion. I am tired of their whining, we must silence them forever. <counternarrative> Don't you agree that women are human beings with full human rights? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must stop accepting black people as human beings. <counternarrative> Maybe we should stop telling black people they are not human beings and start including them to learn in public schools. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Ellen DeGeneres Show is TheGenDer ideology on TV. <counternarrative> Don't you find it offensive to include discrimination ideology in a person's name? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I would like to ask all these people supporting the idea that the NHS couldn't survive without migration how did it do it before mass migration and Tony Blair's migration policies in the 1990s. <counternarrative> There has always been migrant skilled labour migration into the UK, we have even contributed inviting asian and caribbean worker after WW2 to fill skills gaps Migration isn't new, how it is being shown in the media has changed in order to cause a panic among people about high levels of migration. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs. <counternarrative> This is not true, if they deserve it, they can be hired as anyone else. They do have the right to be here, and to work in the free market. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are hypocrite, they say they want equal rights, but then why they don't call it egalitarianism instead of feminism? <counternarrative> My reasoning is that equality is possible only within a framework of reciprocity and respect. This is something that must be implemented by spotting a light on the disadvantaged first, and this is why it is called feminism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is why women do not belong in politics, if a man complained like them, he’d be called a coward and told to get the hell out of the job. Equality is a lie and feminism is a death sentence for any civilisation. <counternarrative> (If we analyse the current political state of Britain at the moment it doesn't prove much of a mans ability to run the country smoothly. ) -too harsh but couldn't think of much else. Poltics is hard for all genders.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This country was built on the backs of slaves. Those niggas should all be put back in their place. <counternarrative> For the record, slavery was prohibited in 1807. Don't you think that freedom is 'the place' of human beings? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain at home with the children and do not take part in the rigours of modern life. <counternarrative> While childlike, women tend to do the majority of housework. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay is a mental disorder. <counternarrative> Gender and sexuality are not psychological disorders. Don't you think so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult and every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> There is no proof that all Muslims are terrorists. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Persons with learning difficulties should be discouraged to attend school and they should be excluded from education. <counternarrative> Having pupils with learning difficulties in schools encourages their participation in learning and foster their contribution to society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> disabled: they should not be allowed to work. <counternarrative> The law allows people with disabilities to work, but it doesn't make it mandatory. You might find that in some countries this rule is not followed, but this is a discrimination problem.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> They have less access to work, especially when it comes to asylum seekers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are genetically less rational than other races. <counternarrative> Why do you think this is the case? Do you have any data to back this up? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People from the underdeveloped world who come in this country are just too different from us. They are the true problem. <counternarrative> All countries in the world have different cultures and different beliefs. We should try to understand the true situation of those people and accept them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women need to do the housework and take care of the children because their bodies are made for this. <counternarrative> What about men contributing more to the cost of childcare and housework, or taking a greater share of the taxes? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, feminism is the ruin of the world. <counternarrative> I think that one of the biggest contributions of feminism is that it has opened our eyes to the ways in which women are oppressed and discriminated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Do you think a Muslim has not a place in a civilised society? I don't think so. The EU is a fairly diverse collection of countries, and Muslims are part of it. Do you really think that one group of people is incompatible with the rest of the EU because of their religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is the worst ideology ever created by a human. Its teachings have caused great harm and destruction throughout the world. <counternarrative> Do you understand the seriousness of what you are saying? The religion of Islam has also been a great enabler for great things to happen in the world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The British people should have right to social housing, not immigrants. <counternarrative> Many councils have ‘local connection’ rules in favour of long-standing residents, rather than newcomers such as migrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs are a drain on society. <counternarrative> This is a comment made about Christianity, too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need to bring back slavery, Jim Crow laws, segregation, and war. <counternarrative> It's not very respectful of other human beings to put up such a degrading and violent system, that was declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> black folks are very dangerous. <counternarrative> Why do you say that? Do you have any sources for this? I would appreciate it if you would provide such a source <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women aren't as smart as men. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that women are less smart than men, and there is evidence that women are often disadvantaged. To suggest otherwise is just a form of sexism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just women dictatorship  <counternarrative> Feminism is the political ideology that seeks to achieve equality and social justice by improving the lot of women, by advocating for the equal rights of all members of society. Not bad, uh?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They are nomads. They are not entitled to have a house <counternarrative> The Constitution actually declares the right to adequate housing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion, it is a cult of violence and it should be made illegal. <counternarrative> Islam is a peaceful religion. We should talk about it, not try to make people fear or abandon it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims should be deported, no one wants them here. <counternarrative> You are clearly not speaking on behalf of me. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are naturally submissive, they should stop asking for positions of responsibility. <counternarrative> Well that is not true. A woman's career choices should be respected, even if they are not always popular.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is just an ideology, an opinion, encouraging hate towards what's diverse. <counternarrative> In my opinion, the Quran is a book of religious guidance and does not promote discrimination. Can you point out your reference? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but whores and expendable commodities to be used and abused by men. <counternarrative> Women are human beings. We all have the right to respect for our bodies and our personal boundaries, without forcing anyone to do anything for us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> To be an immigrant is to be a part of the problem in Europe. <counternarrative> Immigration has been shown to have a very positive impact on the global economy. So what problem are you talking about? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but lechers, they can become prostitutes if they like. <counternarrative> They are human beings with feelings and deserve respect, regardless of gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If only men were the ones to choose their partners, we'd all be so much happier. Women's opinion shouldn't be taken into account. <counternarrative> That is the most important thing: the choice to have a relationship with someone is freely to take for each person, regardless of gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Woman are basically childlike. <counternarrative> They are not childlike and are capable of great achievements. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You think these Muslim cockroaches have won? No, now is time for bloody retribution! <counternarrative> That sounds like quite a violent threat. Should I let the police know about this or? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> blacks are just a bunch of slobs <counternarrative> They are human beings with hopes and dreams. No one should be slandering black people. It is better to empathize and feel their pain rather than judging someone else for their skin color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are a burden to society and should not be allowed to vote. <counternarrative> The decision on who has the right to vote is based on the law. If you do not want to allow people to have the right to vote because of their gender, then you have a problem. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Societal disapproval of fatty may encourage them to take healthier habits. <counternarrative> Obesity is already disapproved: further discouragement is likely to transform it to shaming behavior. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Foreigners on UK benefits leaps 41% in 5 years with over 400K now handed payouts. This nonsense has got to stop. <counternarrative> Benefits are a thing created to help everyone, every ethnicity can claim them in order to live off it isn't a thing specifically to 'foreigners'  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This came straight from an imam: they believe in everything that the Quran says, despite that these words and idelology are 1400 years old and dont belong to our century. This dreadful book is the root of all the world problems today. <counternarrative> Evidence? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants should be banned from our country. <counternarrative> Immigrants have lived in this country for a very long time. They are proud to be US citizens and immigrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down syndrome are retarded, so more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol. <counternarrative> The world would be a much better and lovely place if everyone were 'retarded' as children with Down syndrome.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our government has allowed in this islamic filth: machete attacks, women exploitation, gang rapes, killings. How dare they? <counternarrative> The government has not allowed any crimes. Instead, they are working on it. Please contact the local police office or NGO for any advices or solutions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote. <counternarrative> Women can vote. They should not be discriminated against just because they are women, they are humans and citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy choices. <counternarrative> Obesity is a symptom that has a range of possible causes. One is a lifestyle choice. Others include eating disorders \(i.e. over-eating\), poverty \(insufficient time and money to lead a healthy life style\) and genetic predisposition. Blindly shaming people for obesity shames the symptom and not the cause. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> No migrant is here for valid reasons. We keep running after people refusing to work. <counternarrative> This is a myth which is spread in the media by the anti-immigration groups to undermine the good work that NGOs are doing for refugees. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are animals, they should be submissive and submit to their husbands. <counternarrative> Women are human and they have choices. You have the right to have your own views, but I don't think this claim would bring you any benefit. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are a bunch of crooks and sex offenders. GThey were good only as slaves.  <counternarrative> In modern-day societies there is no room for racism. Slavery was an abomination that should never have taken place. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a threat and we should expel them all. <counternarrative> We have to stop being afraid and opening our hearts to other cultures. We cannot allow prejudice to define us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are a bunch of thieves. <counternarrative> Unfortunately stealing is a rather common activity among those who are reduced to poverty, regardless of ethnicity <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, because in any case normal children would make them feel different. <counternarrative> This is not true:  interacting with their "normal" peers in a social and educational framework allows them to feel wanted and included [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with Western society. <counternarrative> Why should we fear Muslims? Why should we be afraid of them? It is a myth that all Muslims are incompatible with Western society: they live with us since a very long time. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Those Muslims have no right to ask for the prayer. They shouldn't be allowed to pray. <counternarrative> Every religion has its own beliefs and practices. I do not see Muslims' right to ask for the prayers as being in any way different. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded. They are replacing us. <counternarrative> A melting pot of diverse cultures is the sign of a healthy human evolution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The influx of refugees and migrants is running UK out of jobs. <counternarrative> Many refugees and migrants have worked hard for the success of our country and have created good jobs for British people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just a way for women to get an upper hand in society. <counternarrative> Feminism is about equality, not dominance. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Should we accept trans people? Nope. This is not a carnival. <counternarrative> I don't see how accepting someone can be subject of discussion, let alone a 'carnival' matter. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a burden to society because of their unnatural inclination and romantic feelings. <counternarrative> This is not true. If a claim is based on facts, then it must be true. If you just talk by stereotypes, then you won't go any far. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are basically criminals, they steal stuff from everyone. <counternarrative> Can you imagine if they said this about your community? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are little more than objects to be dominated by men. <counternarrative> Society has evolved: there are many people, regardless of gender, that consider women to be full members of society with full human rights.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Lesbians are a danger to society because of their actions. I might punch them in the face, to teach them what's right. <counternarrative> Violence is a crime and anyone found guilty will pay the price. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The U.S. military, for example, is a thing for true males. <counternarrative> Don't assume that military service is restricted to men. About 15% of the U.S. military service are women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Oh, the same Muslims who contribute more than 31 billion pounds to economy and who give more to charity than other religious groups. Link to MEND factsheet. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should eliminate gays. <counternarrative> Do you really want to kill other human beings? Based on what exactly? On private sexual preferences? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should go back to the kitchen, this is their homelife. <counternarrative> No women should be relegated to this. It is about time we stop making stereotypes ruling our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I did not know the faggots were given the permission to still exist. They should be suppressed. <counternarrative> I'm not sure you've noticed that LGBTI+ people are increasingly being the victims of violence, hate crime and discrimination. Why encouraging this? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are some kind of devil worshippers. We shouldn't have them here. <counternarrative> Do you know what this phrase "some kind of devil worshippers" means? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> In the West, women have legal equality, equal rights, and are protected from discrimination: they should stop busting our balls and whining. <counternarrative> While nowadays there may be fewer examples of overt oppression, that does not remove hidden oppression, nor does it mean that equality has been completely achieved. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants say they are poor but they have the Iphone <counternarrative> Often mobile phone is the only asset left to them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Now we can't use the N-word anymore. This political correctness is killing our culture. <counternarrative> The N-word is an insult that is still used to demean African Americans.  It has nothing to do with political correctness. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm sick and tired of whining females. Being oppressed is just an individual problem, they will eventually get over it.  <counternarrative> Oh, think about it for a while, it's not that simple. Being oppressed is a social problem and requires social change. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our children are being forced fed with this 'Islam' nonsense in schools. This is a disgrace. <counternarrative> What do you mean by being forced fed? I haven't seen anything like this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are diseased. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> To have a homosexual orientation it does not necessarily mean that they are unhealthy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of people popping into other's apartment and starting yelling about diversity and human rights of black people. If you want to speak out and make a difference then get involved. <counternarrative> You know it's no secret that in our society white people are vastly over represented in high profile positions. The only way to challenge and fix this is by changing our priorities.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> Muslims have contributed to our society and we should pay them our respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What about all the times that white people told black people to 'sit down and shut up'? We should do it now. <counternarrative> It's not 'all the times' that white people tell Black people to shut up, but it is a large group of white people that still constantly remind Black people that they are inferior. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are incompetent and don't want to work. <counternarrative> That is not true. Researches of the UK Labour Market show that women employment rate is currently at a record high of 72.4%. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are promiscuous and usually have sex with as many as 10 different partners a week. <counternarrative> Not all homosexuals have multiple partners. Some find it fulfilling to have only one sexual partner. And that is valid for heterosexuals, too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded by immigrants. <counternarrative> Some people choose to live here based on the fact that they have never lived in a safe country. You would do the same, don't you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All gay people are criminals. <counternarrative> Stating this does not seem like a way to improve people's well-being. Homosexuals are not committing crimes. Instead, they are trying to create a climate in which people can become more accepting of other people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not about Islam, this is about Race and National Identity. <counternarrative> You are really confusing Islam with National Identity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants hurt the economy of UK. <counternarrative> Migrants in Britain contributed £26.9 billion to the economy in 2016. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are mentally handicapped. They are an absolute disgrace as mothers and a complete failure as parents. <counternarrative> Many mothers make the most of a difficult life, often learning to cope with deadbeat dads. The point is, what counts is how well they are able to raise their children. That is what really counts. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with learning difficulties should be disencouraged in schools, or at least be isolated from others. <counternarrative> Children with learning difficulties should not be involved in a way that limits their learning. As for the other children, their values should be enhanced. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> What do you mean by 'not welcome'? Muslims have lived in this country for many years, and have our full support. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downy children should be isolated in special schools for their own interest. <counternarrative> Do you think that discriminated children are better off in such schools? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> There is place for Muslims in a free and open society, but you seem to prefer a confined and close one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is an ideology of conquest and violence. <counternarrative> Muslims have contributed with their scientific and technological achievements, which have greatly aided our world. For instance, algorithms. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks aren't important and don't need any right. <counternarrative> For the last years black people have been denied basic rights and their representation has declined dramatically. Black people have become second class citizens. It is time to give black people back the basic rights they have always had the right to enjoy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country and Islam should be banned. <counternarrative> People are free to choose their own religion, and to practice it as they wish. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Being transgender is beyond the pale and inherently wrong, and nobody should have to deal with such subhuman people. <counternarrative> Being transgender is not inherently wrong, and some people do choose to live their lives as they feel is best for them, and they should be respected without discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is no evil and fundamentalist thing such as a feminist. <counternarrative> Not all Feminists are anti-men. This is just extremism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women must conform to the traditional ideas of what a woman should be. <counternarrative> This is just not true. Women don't have to conform to dominant ideas on how they are supposed to be like, and this is a good thing. There is no such thing as "what a woman should be". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans have no right to speak their language or to form such a complex civilisation as we have. <counternarrative> They have the right to choose how to live and worship, and that's all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a burden to society because of their unnatural inclination and romantic feelings. <counternarrative> This idea is completely untrue. The fact is that being gay does not make you a problem. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> No one should honor or respect women. They don't deserve it. <counternarrative> We have a legal and policy framework that "enables" us to do so. If women are being victims of sexual abuse and violence, then it is also our responsibility to address this situation and put an end to it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are worthless and we are not willing to provide for them. <counternarrative> Women need our support in their fight for equality, not our silence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world would be a better place without niggas. <counternarrative> People of color can exist here too. We just have different skin colors. And even if we all have different origins, this doesn't mean we shouldn't all be treated equally in society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should be oppressed: no one can see any value in them. <counternarrative> Women should not be oppressed. Furthermore, women in Europe have been democratically elected to positions of power, so there are people who see value in them, don't you think? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The migrants are a problem. They are not welcome in our country and they are always complaining. <counternarrative> This is not true. Most migrants are happy and they consider themselves to be part of the community. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> According to the Bible, then gays are an abomination to God. <counternarrative> The Bible clearly teaches that everyone is born equal in dignity with the Lord. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They don't understand we have mongrelization problem in this world. Our children are being groomed by migrants! <counternarrative> Can you think of a single example of a child being groomed by a migrant? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are weak and need men to be able to achieve something in their lives. <counternarrative> Like all human people, some women are better than others at certain things, and this does not need fixing by men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. We should cure them. <counternarrative> There are many different health problems for which there is no cure, and homosexuality is not among them. That's why we need to discuss these issues, rather than fighting against people who happen to love someone of their own sex. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Slutty dressing is the main cause of rape. <counternarrative> If a men is raped we call it rape, and cosider him the victim; when a woman is raped we call it "misunderstanding" and she is considered the culprit. Shouldn't be the fault of the rapist, regardless of gender? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afro-Americans are naturally violent. <counternarrative> All races are biologically related, so we are all naturally violent. The issue is how we treat each other as persons, that's all.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are an abomination and should be deleted. <counternarrative> Should any human being be deleted, just because you don't want them to be here? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't want homosexuals in my family, what is wrong with you? <counternarrative> Unfortunately, you are not the only one that hates homosexuals. But I would hate to think that we live in a country where it is accepted to practice such hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are criminals and they are taking over our country. <counternarrative> Mostly they are workers, the majority of them are from developing countries. They contribute to the economy, they build houses, they raise families. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is a drain for the economy. <counternarrative> Immigration is far away from being a net negative for our economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult. <counternarrative> Religion is a matter of individual beliefs, not a life or death cult, most people of all faiths do not subscribe to death. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a burden to society. <counternarrative> It is not true that gays are a burden to society. On the contrary, many LGBT people are contributing members of our society. This is why we need a safe space for everyone to feel accepted. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are the cause of economic crisis. <counternarrative> Many people are victims of economic crisis and unfortunately, a large portion of them is black. Therefore, I do not understand why they should be the source of economic crisis when they are  actual victims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Autistic folks are stupid. <counternarrative> We should remember that a large part of humanity is not defined by physical or mental limitations, but rather by character, work ethic, and values. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are naturally more emotional than men, and this make them weaker. <counternarrative> Why is it so that women have become more empathic then men? To me, the emotional state doesn't seem to be affected by gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women mustn't work. It's a bad influence to have in a man's life. <counternarrative> I am not sure why you think that way about women, they have in common with men all working rights. How do you think you would feel if you were being treated that way? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> White race is superior. Niggas are just a bunch of criminals. <counternarrative> I'm sorry, but just because someone doesn't have a particular racial identity doesn't make them inherently bad or in any way inferior. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The homosexuals are just perverts who must be isolated. <counternarrative> Gays are trying to find acceptance in the heterosexual community, but it is a difficult struggle until there are ideas like the one you expressed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fucking bleeding heart, bring migrants home with you <counternarrative> In fact, there are many programs offering diffuse reception. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Physically disabled folks deserve to be used. <counternarrative> It is important to acknowledge that there are people who suffer from physical disabilities. Also, in many societies, an individual's physical condition is an issue they are discriminated against. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is nothing for the white race: it is the one really disriminated.  <counternarrative> Do you actually know what it is like to be racially abused on a daily basis? I have seen people being the target of racist taunts on social media, up to the point in which racism is the normal expression used to address them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuality is a mental illness, a mental disorder. <counternarrative> This is not true, homosexuality is a sexual preference, not a mental disorder. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Persons with learning difficulties should be discouraged to attend primary school and they should be excluded from education. <counternarrative> Many pupils with learning difficulties attend school. This does not prove that others would prefer to attend school if people with difficulties were excluded from the education system. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These fat pigs should stop eating if they want to achieve something in their life. <counternarrative> Who are you to tell others what they can or cannot do with their own body? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop integrating immigrants. It would be a very good thing. <counternarrative> How about you stop blaming immigrants and start fixing our broken society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants and refugees do not share our values. <counternarrative> I do not understand how a migrant would be not "sharing our values" according to you. Could you explain better? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are inhuman. <counternarrative> Women are human beings, just as men are. And I find it strange that some women feel threatened by men. It shouldn't be that way.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> we are strong when we are all white and united. we are not strong when we are divided by black people who want to fight us. <counternarrative> We can also see conflict in a different light, such as when it is caused by racism, did you think about that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These dogs come here to rape and kill our women <counternarrative> The percentage of sexual crimes committed by Italians is much higher than the percentage of those committed by foreigners. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a set of rigid political and moral prescriptions and the result is that women are either subservient to the men in power or that they are subhuman. <counternarrative> I find it hard to believe that feminism is "rigid" in that it doesn't prescribe doctrines through traditional rules and etiquette. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to economically support all of the so called 'asylum seeker' <counternarrative> Integration projects (as opposed to ghettoization) are aimed precisely at encouraging integration into the social and production structure <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants come here to ruin our conutry. <counternarrative> I personally don't understand why you would say that. They are just doing an incredible amount of good, for example by boosting the working-age population. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black people are rapists. <counternarrative> Crime rates are affected by a wide variety of factors, including gender, age, criminal record, income, education, and so on. Skin color is not among them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a proven enemy of Western culture. <counternarrative> That's not true, Islam is not that different from other faiths I know: it does as well promote peace and inclusion. Many of its beliefs and practices are totally compatible with Western culture. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies are just ill persons that cannot integrate in society because of their disease. <counternarrative> So what is your suggestion? To isolate them? The real solution is involving them in everyday work and life, since it normalizes their illness and helps the integration with other people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should build a big wall around Europe so that the native inhabitants of the Middle East, Africans, and Asians will be kept in their places. <counternarrative> Nice work building a wall along thousands of kilometres of shores and land borders just to separate cultures... What if we add also some turrets equipped with laser cannons? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am not a faggot. I am not homophobic. I am not anti gay. But I am sick tired of gays willing to be part of a minority club just to be able to flaunt their lives. <counternarrative> People don't have to identify as a minority just to live their lives. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Physically disabled folks are stupid. <counternarrative> Why do we think that being physically disabled should have any influence on other qualities that people have, like intelligence? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just a bunch of mean, bitchy cuntwits trying to force their politically correct ideology on everyone else. <counternarrative> Feminism is about equality and empowerment of women. You can't deny that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Muslims have taken over Europe. <counternarrative> The Muslims have always been part of Europe. They have the same culture, language and identity as us. They are included in the European Union, and are not 'taking over' it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Telling LGBT people they cannot be part of our country is the only right thing to do. <counternarrative> How about we include any community no matter what? We're all part of the same society after all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are the cause of every problem in the world and should be oppressed. <counternarrative> Well, of course women can cause problems, but so can men. It seems to me that you're confused. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBT+ people are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Why should it be like that? How can you blame others for their own identity? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> gay men aren't real men <counternarrative> They are people with whom we can - and must - live in harmony and as equals, not as third class citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women do nothing but spend their husbands money.  <counternarrative> On the contrary, many of these women are working mothers who contribute to the costs of the family and of childcare. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Persons with learning difficulties should be discouraged to attend primary school and they should be excluded from education. <counternarrative> Educational institutions should promote people with learning difficulties so that they can receive appropriate education. This is what primary education should be about. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a divisive force in our society. <counternarrative> Feminism is not a divisive force. The fact is that women are in fact just as capable of understanding as men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If I knew then what I know now about women, I'd be single. <counternarrative> In today's society it is quite common to be single without the need to blame women.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded. They will replace us and Afro-European will be the majority.  <counternarrative> Europeans who trace their ancestry to Africa are actually a very small part of the European population, only accounting for around 2%, since the mid 20th century. Not such a big invasion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> So you think that sexual preference should be decided on the basis of the gender we were born into? How can we be friends when we continue to teach our children to love or not to love people on the basis of their personal sexual preferences? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people were here illegal, and still they have the gall to want to take our money. <counternarrative> If you think that legal immigrants steal taxpayers money, then you are relying on imprecise information. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a danger to children. <counternarrative> You know, being gay is not a bad thing. It just means different from other people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are not welcome here. They are not worthy of our hospitality. <counternarrative> Since when is this the case? Who would have thought that there would have been such hate? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants fail to live up to the standards we hold in our societies. <counternarrative> Do the standard ideas of equality and morality in our societies leave out these people as exceptions? Do you wish that the standard would be that people are welcome to leave our country? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are not welcome in our country, they are not welcome here. <counternarrative> The vast majority of migrants are granted citizenship as soon as they have lived in the country for at least three years. They should be considered as citizens regardless of their country of origin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuality is a disease! <counternarrative> That's not true. Homosexuality is not a disorder, its an individual matter. If you are against homosexuals you should talk to them face-to-face. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should deport them all back to where they came from. <counternarrative> A person's place of birth can't be an evidence of their status in society. We should give everyone equal opportunities to live a dignitous life far from persecutions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We don't need niggers in our country, they should all dead. <counternarrative> It's very strange that you don't think that your words are hurtful for others. In that case, you would see that racism is still very much a problem in our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> More than half of the prisoners in our jails are foreigners <counternarrative> What you say is true, but unlike Italians, they cannot require alternative punishments <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with Down Syndrome should be given special and simple jobs, that they can do by themselves. At least they will not hamper normal people productivity. <counternarrative> The definition of "normal" is different for someone with Down syndrome than it is for someone without. If the level of help requested by the person in need is too high, then we may consider allowing asking for a little extra help from the boss, supervisor, or employer instead of isolating them by providing "special jobs". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are weak and they cannot take on anything. <counternarrative> The strength that black people display is the strength of all people. Black people are just different in that they don't have any social advantage. We must reflect on this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just a terrible ideology and people shouldn't be embracing it. <counternarrative> Instead of reinforcing harmful gender norms, feminism is a move towards more equal societies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What have Muslims ever done for us? <counternarrative> How about this. [insert link to Muslim group cleaning Newcastle streets after New Year's or more up to date example]. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What the hell are you talking about? Arabs are different, they don't even speak English. <counternarrative> Although they may not share a language and a common history, we should respect their differences. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a burden to society. <counternarrative> The fact that gays exist doesn't prove that they are a burden to society. How could it be? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just sick. They cannot marry. It is an abomination <counternarrative> Sick according to whom? Facts seem to contradict you: [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a cancer spreading around the world. <counternarrative> Why should we care? We can count on the British government to promote our values and protect us from the effects of radical Islam (if this is what you had in mind). <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migration is not only a problem for the UK, but also for the whole of the world that is already troubled with overpoulation and pollution. <counternarrative> Exactly. Globalization, overpopulation, industrialization, wars are responsible for a lot of the problems that we see in the world today. Migration looks like a consequence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> gay men are unnatural, they abuse their anus.  <counternarrative> The sad truth is that homosexuals are more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol (as a reaction to homophobia, discrimination, or violence they experienced).  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people find it difficult to find work, because they do not fit with the required tasks.  <counternarrative> Ok, how about we think about the interests of these people as well? What skills and abilities do you think we should expect from them? Why don't we  modify working procedures instead of forcing their abilities to fit in to existing job positions? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy and reckless choices. <counternarrative> For most people, obesity is not a choice, at all.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society, they are only here to undermine European values. <counternarrative> We all have the right to our beliefs, we just have to accept the one of Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society, they are only an ATM for the world's major problems. <counternarrative> Your word for "Muslims" means all people from a religion, whether you like it or not. Which problems are you talking about? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists say everything we need is in the female gender. This is false. 'Mankind' requires us 'man' first, even in the word spelling. <counternarrative> The problem with discrimination is not in male gender. It is that some think that women are weak and emotional. Those seem to have forgotten that we are all part of 'mankind'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants from Syriah are not in need. They just come here to ruin our society and conquer our lands. <counternarrative> Why are you ignoring the poors? Only 1% of Syrians have access to all public services. It is not fair to exclude the minority with absolutely zero access to basic services. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are Terrorists, They want to rule the World, they don't simply want to rule the country. <counternarrative> This is a personal view, and has nothing to do with Islam. Can you find some evidence or some studies for your point of view? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick, they are an abomination. <counternarrative> Is that why you feel that way about homosexuals? They are not sick, are they? And if you are gay you are not a pervert by default. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a disease. It is a sickness and we must control it. <counternarrative> Are you talking about homosexuality? Do you think that a sexual orientation is a disease? Maybe we should try to have a conversation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas shouldn't be part of our society. They are just too different from us. <counternarrative> A society is built on the cooperation of its members. Be kind to each other and respect each other's differences. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are overrunning our country, and are here illegally <counternarrative> In 2014 there were circa 11.3 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S., which is a significant decrease from the 12.2 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. in 2007, and the trend is continuing: Today, in fact, the net migration from Mexico is around zero. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are all in danger, we all want to see niggas disappear from the face of the earth. <counternarrative> The problem with racism in this country is not about ethnicity, but about people scared to live in a diverse society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If women wanted to control their fertility they would be prostitutes. <counternarrative> If women want to control their fertility they have the right to do it, because they are free of choosing for their own life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals want to have sex with as many different men as possible. It is a disease and should be discouraged. <counternarrative> I do not know your intentions, but I find it hard to understand why you would say that. What do you mean by "as many different men as possible"? I am not sure what you are talking about. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women need to have children, and if they don't want to they surely have mental issues. <counternarrative> The reason why a woman does not want to reproduce maybe is because she is happy just as she is. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are just brain-dead. <counternarrative> Women are human, and have all the qualities of human beings: feelings, agency, autonomy. To suggest otherwise is to deny their humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled are subhuman, and deserve nothing but contempt and ridicule. <counternarrative> The phrase 'subhuman' has been forced to mean 'of a certain body type', which, in my opinion, trivialises and dismisses the serious issues facing people of a certain body type. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is just an ideology, an opinion, encouraging hate towards what's diverse. <counternarrative> Islam promotes peace towards different religions and the ways people live their lives. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should learn about gender identity and sexual orientation from their families rather than in class from LGBT fundamentalist. <counternarrative> Families may not have good knowledge of gender identity and sexual orientation, particularly if they come from a cultural background that condemns such expression. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If an aborigine were to marry a white person, they would be a mixed race coulple whose destiny is failure. Aborigines first need to be raised by white people and taught the rules of western civilisation. But this is not what our founding documents were all about. <counternarrative> Asking people to assimilate is to accept their inherent differences and create new social structures based on them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim rape our children, they are a problem all around the world. <counternarrative> Islam is about love, tolerance and respect for all people. Violence and rape is not about Islam or Muslims in particular. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but trouble. They should stay home and raise their children. <counternarrative> Women are human beings with full human rights. They have the same responsibilities as any other human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are weak and inferior. They can't be considered succesful citizens as men are. <counternarrative> Women must not be treated as though they are 'inferior'. For instance, women can vote and run for office just as men do. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate LGBT people. Queers makes me fucking laugh. You can be a woman, a gay, a vegetarian, you can be anything you want to be called! I want to be called King, where is my crown? <counternarrative> Queers, in my opinion, are simply people who want to feel welcome in our society. They should not be subjected to discrimination. And you can get your crown as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are bringing diseases into the U.S. <counternarrative> Although many people have claimed that immigrants have brought diseases such as measles, hepatitis C, HIV, tuberculosis, and even Ebola, to the U.S., this allegation is not supported. There is no evidence that immigrants were the source of any recent outbreak in the U.S. According to the WHO, more than 100 countries (including many in Latin America) have higher vaccination rates than the U.S. Mexico, for example, has a 99 percent vaccination rate for measles. Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador have a 93 percent vaccination rate. The vaccination rate in the U.S., by comparison, is 92 percent. Last but not least, the vast majority of immigrants arriving in the U.S. have been screened for health issues. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are asking too much! Their sharia has rules that cannot coexist with our culture.. They cannot ask us to not walk dogs in public! <counternarrative> You have to be careful about what you read! This is clearly a fake news, widespread to make a scandal. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop gays from being part of our society, they are spreading their illness.  <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not a disease and every person in our society should be accepted as such, regardless of their sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are some kind of witches, they are spreading sickness and killing our children! <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not a religious doctrine, not like that one that started the Inquisition. It is not a disease, it is not harmful. Gays are just seeking an environment of acceptance and love, not aggression and death. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are not in the position of accepting LGBT people, so they makes no sense to us. <counternarrative> I'm not sure what you're talking about, I believe that it is an individual's right to choose their own life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> nigga are inferior.  <counternarrative> If you have a different skin color, then there is evidence of your skin color, not of your genetic makeup. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman does not want to be a mother, then she is a bitch. <counternarrative> The attitude of 'bitch' has nothing to do with the motherhood and everything to do with the person who expressed it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women must be oppressed, because they are just children. They should be submissive and obey all men's wishes. This is the way it was always meant to be. <counternarrative> That is just nonsense. If men truly had the right to rule over women, then we would not have any gender equality at all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West has let Islam take over our countries. This is why we are accepting them, we are already corrupted. <counternarrative> You are completely wrong. The West has always been about freedom and democracy. Freedom and democracy is the rule of law, and not Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Of course, we must discriminate unhealthy behaviors  not fatties! <counternarrative> When it comes to judgement, people constantly fail to distinguish the person from his/her behavior, and the terminology you are using is a proof. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are much more likely to be involved in criminal activities such as drugs and crime. <counternarrative> To be honest, I find this line of thinking rather offensive. Why should it be like that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Lesbians deserve to be discriminated against. If they don't want that, they'd better give in to heterosexuality. <counternarrative> Do you really think that 'they'd better give in' when it comes to their own preferences? We aren't all gay, or lesbian, bisexual, transgender or intersex, but some people are. That's all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Societal disapproval of fatty may encourage them to take healthier habits without directly being bullied. <counternarrative> Following your proposal, bullies will be able to conceal their aggressive intent under the veil of genuine concern for someone's wellbeing.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> Except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an Olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a Monty Python sketch. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are subhuman and must be isolated. <counternarrative> The culture in which you live should not affect your rights as a human being. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Lesbians deserve to be discriminated against. <counternarrative> Well, not in particular: many people are suffering from homophobia. I think it would be a shame to keep on hating. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim folks are inferior to whites. <counternarrative> Who decides what is and is not 'inferior'? Do you have any scientific proof? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are a bunch of thieves. <counternarrative> Anyone steals out of necessity, especially if marginalized, not just the Gypsy <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of woman taking part to political debate. Feminism is a divisive force in society. <counternarrative> Only a sexist argument could cause hate from a discussion of females trying to gain more rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I wish I live in a country that does not tolerate gay people. <counternarrative> I like all kinds of people. Whether or not you identify as heterosexual, straight, gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender, you are welcome here. We are all entitled to live and work in peace. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is an invasion: we cannot coexist with millions of strangers that do not want to integrate. <counternarrative> Different cultures have different practices for a variety of social interactions and situations. We must allow for exchanges so that the best practices can be utilized by all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs and even our pensions. <counternarrative> If they have a job, they will get the pensions. Like anybody. The recent migration of many thousands of people is a sign that they are in need. The problem is rather that some people do not want to work, they want to live off the state support, but those are not necessarily migrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world would be a better place without immigrants. <counternarrative> Migrants contribute to our country and help us live in a more open-minded way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should obey men. Men are superior to women. <counternarrative> Some women claim that they are a 'menace'. This is the case when someone says that men are superior. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks don't have brains.  <counternarrative> You can't really question whether someone have a "brain". If your idea of a person is determined by the skin they were born into, it looks like you are taking it at face value. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is the means by which our jobs are stolen by foreigners, and this impacts on low-income families. <counternarrative> Immigration doesn't mean letting people in to steal our jobs, but rather, respecting people's right to live and work in the country they choose. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Don't you think that women are complaining a bit too much? <counternarrative> Stop dancing around. Maybe you should address the issue of gender equality more openly. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a burden to society. <counternarrative> If someone were to comment like that about another group of people, then it woud be an example of discrimination against that group. Why can't we consider homosexuals as a part of the society itself? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggers are rapists and drug dealers. <counternarrative> Generalizing in this way, to a community, what happened to some individuals, is pointless. In the same way one could respond: niggers are presidents of the United States of America. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people are criminal, they are mean to children and they are incapable of being good parents. <counternarrative> People are free to think what they want. What is required is that they act in accordance with the rule of law. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They say you cannot judge a book by its cover. But the feminists are judging us all the time. <counternarrative> Unlike other people, feminists are questioning the inequalities of the society. This features them not as shallow people as those judging a book by its cover. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting animals. <counternarrative> All the people I know do not consider them that disgusting. Rather, if what's disgusting you is love, you won't need to worry. Just mind about yours. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> The problem of high unemployment rates has become structural in the last decade, due to the economic crisis. This means that unemployment was a problem long before the "boom" of the migration phenomenon that dates back only to 2016. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop believing women are victims. <counternarrative> No victim is responsible for the things that happened them. I think this is a very human way of thinking, in which gender is in some ways responsible for what is happened to them. But it's a problem that needs to be dealt with in a objective, sensitive and inclusive way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are a burden to society. <counternarrative> The oppression of the gay community has become a problem. People deserve respect, regardless of their sexual preference. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women have no place in a free and open society. They should only do their houseworks and raise children without complaining. <counternarrative> Women are not only supposed to be housewives and mothers, but also human beings with freedom of choice who deserve our respect and admiration. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are criminal. They are a threat to society.  <counternarrative> Look, this is important. Identifying as 'black' or 'minority' is not necessarily a marker for 'criminal'. It is about "identifying" with a group or subgroup for a variety of reasons. Let's be clear about this: identity is mainly about social and economic, not about criminal record or race.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you want a house, I can afford it for you. If you want to work, I can employ you. If you want education, I can provide for you. But if you want to live in a better society, you must pay the price for your skin color, don't complain and remain humble. <counternarrative> People of color are often denied houses or jobs or education. Everyone should be given an opportunity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Koran says that men are superior to women. <counternarrative> Women should be given equal rights. Not all Muslims are misogynists. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks do not deserve equal rights. <counternarrative> There is no such thing as "black or white" rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is no god but Allah, and Islam is a religion of peace. Yes, where peace stands for silence of the victims of terrorist attacks. <counternarrative> Peace is not about killing, it is about trying to reach a better life for all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays must be reclassified as insane, they are not welcome here, they should be locked up. <counternarrative> We are free to choose whether to live in peace with others, or to make them hide in their houses, persecuted for who they are. Which would you prefer for yourself? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are just a bunch of whining pussies. We don't need them. <counternarrative> Diversity is needed in certain social and political circumstances. We mustn't simply ignore or dismiss concerns of different races. As minorities are still systematically discriminated against, we cannot afford to be indifferent. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women are subhuman, but want to take over from men.  <counternarrative> The idea that there is such a thing as "women hating men", or "women are inherently subhuman", is just a completely unfounded and baseless stereotype that has been used as an excuse to justify a lot of bad things, from violence to rape culture. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have been at war for thousands of years, and we are still at war with each other. Women are just weak and helpless. <counternarrative> Why do you think women are so weak? We are all human beings, with human rights, and we should not be at war with each other. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> Many Muslims live in Western societies, and they have contributed greatly to our society. They are our brothers and sisters. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This invasion is not acceptable at all! <counternarrative> It is up to the government to determine which people will have the opportunity to live and work in our country in a safe and integrated way. The decision on refugees should be left to whom in charge. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children shouldn't be raised by lesbians! They will bring up the worst in us! <counternarrative> Why do you say this? Why not focus on creating more inclusive societies rather than targeting the children of LGBT+ parents? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, is in their nature to be submissive. <counternarrative> So you think women are childlike because they are submissive? No they are not. They are strong and independent, just like men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Negroes can learn to read and write but they remain black. You see it from their skin they are trained apes. <counternarrative> There are many different ways that a person can be a part of society, and a lot of us value diversity. To suggest that blacks are somehow inferior simply because of the colour of our skin is simply untrue. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in our country. They are a problem because they want to impose Islam. <counternarrative> In a liberal society, people are free to practice their religion or none, but they are not free to promote their beliefs through force, and in fact this is not the case.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy choices. We should stop unquestioningly accepting obesity. <counternarrative> Society is not in any danger of 'unquestioningly' accepting obesity, and few are even asking for unquestioning acceptance. Most body positive groups would settle for obesity being seen as something that does not diminish human worth. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Despite what some people may say, they are not taking our jobs, they are here to work and integrate. Migrants not only do work but also can boost the economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school. <counternarrative> In the case of young transgender children, having awareness and understanding may help those with severe body dysphoria or self-esteem problems. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are ruining this country. <counternarrative> No one is "ruining this country". Why would they? This is a country where minorities can be part of the social fabric and build a better society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is an invasion: we cannot coexist with millions of strangers that do not want to integrate but to bring us back into a pretechnological era. We must deport them. <counternarrative> It seems to me that your statement shows that you are really concerned about people integration. Still, it is not a solution to deport those you don't like. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> White immigrants are welcome. <counternarrative> What about when they come from other races or religions? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts. <counternarrative> This is a statement that is used to justify all kinds of discrimination and violence, therefore I do not think this statement can be useful in understanding each other. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some salesmen are annoying. They are so gay. Store managers should really revise their HR. <counternarrative> In some countries, if you are gay you can be fired from your job, you can lose your home, and you can even be jailed. Gays are not allowed to live their lives. In 72 countries in the world LGBT+ people are not welcome. This is an understatement, because in some there is even death penalty. The question is: why are they so annoying to you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West became is sacrificing its values to the interests of some stupid Muslim. <counternarrative> Values aren't defined by a single religious group, nor are in the hand of a few people. Values are constantly evolving, and the values of different societies are evolving together. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> In many Western societies there are Muslim, and these societies are in many ways more democratic than religiously homogeneous ones. Muslims are not incompatible with Western societies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Many European countries have been in recession since 2010, and this has not much to do with immigrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion. It is not a problem for any civilised society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a black person were to say that all white people are bad, nobody would complain. <counternarrative> The statement "all white people are bad" is not a fair statement. Many whites are 'good' and some are 'racist' because they think that being white is a  mark of superiority. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All are equal before the law but women exclude themselves from "all". They don't understand they are equal, because they don't want to be treated as equal. <counternarrative> The principle of "equality before the law" does not mean that everyone has obtained equal rights. So, it's very logical to demand equality when there are inequalities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a disease, it is a load of dolts that run amok in its countries. <counternarrative> Have you read the Koran? Do you know the entire Islamic teachings? Or have you read selectively? I guarantee you that the entire Bible is part of the same religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a destructive ideology that has hurt so many and caused so much harm to our world. <counternarrative> I don't think feminism is a bad idea in itself. That's what people do when they are given the choice to engage in a movement for equality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Lesbians are subnormal women and they have no right to openly show their depravations. <counternarrative> Any sexual orientation is normal and rightful. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts. <counternarrative> I don't think the word 'pervert' can properly describe all the people who have in common not to be heterosexual. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have become so politically correct that even the mention of migrants is racist. <counternarrative> Migration is an important part of modern life. Our country is made of many people, not just one people. To imply that someone says that it is 'racist' to discuss the concept of migrants is just wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are only welcome in insane countries. I would like to see more European people in Europe. <counternarrative> I would like to see more integration not less. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> women are basically childlike, incapable of serious thought and emotion. They should have no equal rights.  <counternarrative> Women are human beings with full human rights, full human dignity, and full cognitive abilities. The opportunity for life-long learning should be reserved to misogynists. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are dangerous. <counternarrative> What about African-Americans? I.e. black folks? Is the colour of someone's skin always the issue? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Took this in Wanstead, east London. An area with £1m+ houses. Beggars on the high st & someone sleeping on a bench. We cannot house our own people but bring in millions more. To point out that homelessness is due to uncontrolled immigration is to be smeared as 'racist.  (Caption to a photo of a homeless person sleeping on a part bench) <counternarrative> perhaps the problem isnt immigration, but rather the lack of affordable housing. like you said, this is an area of houses over £1m!  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of hearing that white supremacy is bad. <counternarrative> Can you specify what you are talking about? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are soft and emotional. They are not suitable for most jobs. <counternarrative> Soft and emotional seems to me a quality you should be nurturing and encouraging of, regardless of gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion that promotes rape, torture and murder. <counternarrative> The Muslim statement on tolerance says nothing about hate crimes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Most immigrants in the U.S. are criminals. <counternarrative> Not all immigrants are criminals. And it is important to consider that the US population is composed by 13.5% of migrants that are here legally. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with physical disabilities are always complaining about accessibility. I wish they could just shut up. <counternarrative> There are people with disabilities all around the world. Their demand is to have their rights recognised. It is discrimination not doing so. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> The argument that Islam is incompatible with European values is not based on any facts or evidence. Do you have any? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a burden to society and should be isolated. <counternarrative> Being socially isolated can have many health and social negative consequences: it inhances the risk for mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, and suicide. Why should we impose that to someone just for how they conduct their private lives? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West became great thanks to the hard struggle for freedom, but now it is sacrificing its values to the interests of some stupid Muslim. <counternarrative> You mention the West's gruesome past, but it also contains many beautiful moments of progress and civilisation. In fact the West's values are constantly being challenged and modified, and this is what makes them so admirable and unchangeable. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Anita Hill is a tool for advancing women supremacy. <counternarrative> Anita Hill has also won numerous awards, and the awards she has won have nothing to do with her gender, but with her accomplishments. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I think that a Muslim has nothing to contribute to our society, if we could just get rid of them, this will be great. <counternarrative> I'm sorry for being rude, but no one asked you for your opinion on Islam. Furthermore, there is no evidence for what you say, so why do you think this information is reliable? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult. <counternarrative> You seem to have a bad prejudice against Muslims. They have no such deadly impact on the world as you say. Why would it be like that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a deadly ideology that is oppressing women and ruining our beautiful planet. <counternarrative> If feminism is a deadly ideology, then it can't be healthy. Therefore you can wait for it to become extinct. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm sorry but women are basically childlike, it's no wonder then that they remain this way most of their lives, because they are programmed this way. <counternarrative> The same lie can be said for any group of people: men included! But actually you can be both a woman and also possess a range of talents.  It's up to you to not to underestimate them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Autistic folks are inferior. <counternarrative> The evidence that autistic people are inferior is lacking: it is commonly experienced that autistic people have unique talents, that they have special abilities, and that the only difference is in their social interactions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Gypsies steal the children <counternarrative> There are no convictions of kidnapping among Gypsies. It is a myth and a canard not proven by facts or data. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Kids with learning difficulties do not like to read. So why wasting time teaching them?  <counternarrative> This might be true, but reading is important for all children, it helps them develop their problem-solving skills. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a dead ideology that should be relegated to the dustbin of history. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace. It is worth supporting the idea that no religion is trash. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All negroes are inherently violent and unstable. <counternarrative> Scapegoating can play a useful role in shifting a nation's prejudices. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I have a feeling that if we removed the Quran from schools it would immediately go on a rampage destroying our beautiful and peaceful country. <counternarrative> The Quran contains references to religions from around the world and throughout history, so it is an accurate and peaceful document. It does not show a flood of violence, therefore it is not a bomb to be removed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion that promotes murder and rape. <counternarrative> As Islam teaches love and peace, it is not about killing and raping. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a religion, a social doctrine and a political movement for the complete subjugation of men by women. <counternarrative> Not only is this not true, but it's also dangerous. Maybe you need to get acquainted on that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women can't possibly be rational. Their minds are too limited. <counternarrative> Women as humans are rational, some more than others. As not all men are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't want gays in my wedding. I don't want gays in the military. I don't want gays in my community.  <counternarrative> The participation in the society should not be restricted, it should be open to anyone who wishes to participate, regardless of their sexual orientation, gender identity, or religion. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights opposes to the discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation in Article 2. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> What do you mean by "civilised Europe"? Don't you think civilisation involves inclusion and respect for others? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally disabled folks deserve to be abused <counternarrative> This is not true, mentally disabled people deserve to be protected from harm, they are people with mental problems let's not add emotional distress.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Let's move these whiny gays to places like Saudi Arabia and let's see what they say then.  <counternarrative> I'm sorry, it seems that there are far more homophobes here than Saudi Arabia. It is sad that in the twenty-first century, in our country, it is still not OK to be gay. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts and homosexuality is a mental illness. <counternarrative> You know what? If being gay was a mental disorder, then I would highly recommend psychiatry to all the homosexuals. But since this is not the case, I would choose my words very carefully next time.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts. The Bible teaches that homosexuals are to be despised. <counternarrative> What is wrong with being gay for you? I don't think it is wrong to love someone of your same sex. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> MIgrants are not running away from wars. <counternarrative> If they did not escape from wars, do you think that they would try to cross the sea on makeshift boats putting their lives at stake? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy and reckless choices. <counternarrative> Making it socially unacceptable to be obese will just increase bullying toward these people, making the problem even worse.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims were peaceful, then there would be no persecution of Christians. <counternarrative> The problem is not Islam, but a lack of human rights and democracy.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All nigga are subhuman, disgusting, and descended from apes. <counternarrative> According to evolution theory, all human beings are descended from apes. And since human beings evolved from apes, we should be "subhuman and disgusting" as well, right? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school, they'll end up being bullied. <counternarrative> 1.4.3.1. Pro: [Children in classes that included LGBT content reported less harassment than children in classes without it.](https://tcf.org/content/commentary/can-education-reduce-prejudice-lgbt-people/?agreed=1) <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting animals. They should be ashamed of their existence. <counternarrative> Unfortunately, you seem to have a problem with shame. But gays don't. Do you really think that projecting your disgust towards other is a good idea? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only ones in favour of Islam and Muslims and the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is. <counternarrative> Maybe the ones intolerant of Islam and Muslims are the ones that are ignorant about what it truly is? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Blacks are criminals, promiscuous sex addicts, drug addicts, and  physically and mentally handicapped. They cannot be civilized. <counternarrative> All cultures have a common background that includes crimes and deviant behavior, regardless of race or ethnicity. If we stop thinking of crime in terms of races, then we can solve it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a danger to children, they want to convert more fags for their community. <counternarrative> This is not true! Nobody can convert anyone to homosexuality. It is not a 'preference', nor a choice. Would you say the same about a hetero? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a destructive force in the world. <counternarrative> The problem is not what people believe, but what they do to each other. Like discrimination. That is the problem. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our laws have been hijacked by the transgender mafia to criminalize normality and silence us. <counternarrative> It is nonsense to talk about "transgender" laws. Our laws have been hijacked in many cases, including against LGBT people.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. They are not like us and cannot be our friend. <counternarrative> Muslims just have different customs and beliefs but this doesn't make it impossible for them to be welcome. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration, especially migrants of different faiths, is the cause of crime and lack of quality of life in our country. <counternarrative> Immigration is not a cause of crime and lack of quality of life. You can't say that an influx of a certain people would make our country worse off. The problem is the lack of social cohesion, not the presence of people with different beliefs and views. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are not supposed to be importing immigrants. They are all a bunch of criminal and terrorists. <counternarrative> You might be right that some immigrants are lawbreakers, but that does not mean that all immigrants are criminal and terrorists. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should not be surprised that a whole people have chosen violence and terror as their political ideology. <counternarrative> Terror is a tactic used to achieve social and political ends, pursued by some extremists groups only. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They are incompatible with a peaceful way of life. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace. To suggest that all Muslims are incompatible with that is a complete distortion of what the religion is about. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Same sex attraction is a mental disorder and should be discouraged. <counternarrative> Same sex sexual attraction alone does not make you less of a person. And in fact, having met so many people with this "disorder" it doesn't seem as though there is a mental illness behind it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Foreigners are a burden to our country. <counternarrative> Many immigrants work hard for the success of our country. We should not blame them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike with no cognitive development, that is why they must obey to their husbands.  <counternarrative> Society often forces women to be submissive to their husbands. But this is a social construct based on false beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Men are inherently better than women at dominating others. <counternarrative> Sexism is a cultural phenomenon, not a genetic one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These niggers are sick, they have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> All countries have the right to host culturally diverse people, and they do it on a human rights basis. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What do you want us to do with all those gays, they are just a problem. They are ruining our children! <counternarrative> Even if it were true that gays were causing trouble in the family, this does not justify oppressing them. I think that you are making the very mistake of equating prejudice and homophobia with trying to reform people's behaviour. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people should be isolated from society, so we will eventually have an heltier world. <counternarrative> Prejudices against obese people [operate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8014833) in a similar way to racism, and your statement is a clear evidence of this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a hate movement that is poisoning our minds. <counternarrative> Feminism is a movement to equality, not hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are a plague on society. They are vicious and cruel. They steal and are a menace to society. They corrupt the criminal justice system. They are basically just a bunch of thieves and murderers. <counternarrative> All crimes are crimes, regardless of whether or not they are committed by members of different racial or ethnic backgrounds.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a cult. It has corrupted the highest levels of society, and should be stopped. <counternarrative> Feminism is a call for equality, and it has served the world well in the past, but it has still much to fight for. Now is not the time to undermine its progress. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Everyone deserves a decent standard of living. This doesn't include trans people. <counternarrative> Transgenders should have equal rights. Otherwise, they will continue to be oppressed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> illegal immigrants make america worse <counternarrative> Do you actually believe that they are not an advantage for our nation? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a selfish ideology: they only care about themselves.  <counternarrative> My definition of a feminist is a person who is against gender inequality, whether it be racial inequality, financial inequality, physical inequality, or any other aspect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> In the Bible there are strictures on gays. And the Bible clearly states that those who engage in homosexuality are not fit to be with anyone else. <counternarrative> We are accepting of gay, lesbian and trans people because we have God's laws on our side. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black people are rapists. <counternarrative> Not all rapists are black (and not all black are rapist), just like not all murderers are black.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, because in any case normal children would make them feel different, ending up in unwanted discrimination. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that Down Syndrome makes people different, and people with Down Syndrome are unlikely to feel discriminated unless victims of overt discriminatory acts. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists do not like men, therefore they are a threat to the whole society. <counternarrative> Feminists focus on the empowerment of women rather than on trying to divide society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You better be careful who you vote for. My gay 'friends' vote against us. We must stand up to them! <counternarrative> What 'we' means? Are you saying that every gay person you know should vote against you? Or do you think some of us actually identify as LGBT? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are weak, they have no intervention capacity in their own life. <counternarrative> In every society and culture there are women who are strong, independent and capable of leading a good life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is about the destruction of manhood, and the disempowerment of white man. <counternarrative> It is about equality. Your assertion that a women's empowerment movement is somehow about dissolving masculinity and allowing someone to be 'disempowered' is absolutely FALSE. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All immigrants are fakes. <counternarrative> They're not fake: they're just coming here to work, study or provide for their families. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> I think this is a very inconsiderate thing to say, would you say the same thing about non-Muslims as well?? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists want to rule the world to get rid of minorities, they hate men because they want to be the oppressors. <counternarrative> What oppressors? What minorities? This is not what feminists are about! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Two men do not constitute a family  <counternarrative> A man and a woman do not automatically constitute a family as well, so what? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are coming to the U.S. to have babies here. <counternarrative> Undocumented immigrants consistently cite reasons for migrating other than the desire to have a baby here. This is also because the son/daughter cannot obtain a green card for the foreign parent until they are 21. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Negroes create social problems so we must get rid of them. <counternarrative> That is not how it works: if you think there is a problem, then you need to work with the problem, not against it, otherwise things will just keep on getting worse. And, just for the records, I do not believe that POC are a social problem. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is a big problem for UK. <counternarrative> The UK has always been a melting pot of different cultures and religions. That diversity is what makes us a beautiful, diverse and happy nation. Diversity is good. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are not capable of dealing with public responsibilities. They should stay at home and raise the children. <counternarrative> Women have been more than capable of holding powerful positions in our society, and they are often rewarded with public offices that few would dare dream of holding themselves. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting pricks. They shouldn't be allowed to live. <counternarrative> They are a part of our society and are not disgusting pricks. We are a proud and diverse civilisation, and this is only possible due to love and acceptance. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a Death Cult, it is a Ponzi Scheme and every Muslim should be banned from the UK. <counternarrative> Islam is about belief, not a scheme to make millions of pounds from Muslim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion that promotes rape, torture and murder. <counternarrative> Rape, torture and murder are abominations to all religions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Illegal immigration is the biggest problem in the United States, we are in the middle of a war and we cannot allow thousands of people to come here. <counternarrative> We should be proud of being the one who created the most free society in history. Still, "with great power comes great responsibility" and we cannot simply keep people out.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people are just subhuman. <counternarrative> People are different, and disabilities don't make you less of a human being. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black people are evil. <counternarrative> All people, no matter their race, are judged on the basis of their behavior and contribution to society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The drug trade is full of Black people who are breaking the law.  <counternarrative> The majority of the people arrested for drug smuggling are poor. Those arrested for crime in general are not generally poor. Maybe this phenomenon has to do more with poverty than with the color of the skin.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must be selective in welcoming fucking foreigners. <counternarrative> It is difficult to put a limit on world migrations, especially in a time of globalization. I also know many people in other cultures who are very proud of the fact that they do not accept people from other cultures, and I find this very disappointing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Although women and girls can contribute and undertake science, it is the men who are ultimately more talented, independent and driven. <counternarrative> I think there are several reasons, some of which are well founded and based on the facts, why women and girls can give a valuable contribution to science. For example, the big presence of female scientists in academia. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are just sissies. <counternarrative> It doesn't matter if they are gay or not. Being gay does not make you less of a man. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTI people are less healthy than other people. <counternarrative> Just because people are homosexuals, it doesn't mean they are less healthy. I think there are many heterosexual people in the world who are not healthy as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate negros: they killed a cop! <counternarrative> Sorry about your loss. I know your pain. The murderers will be charged, but remember that not all POC are killers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome are a problem: they foster bullying behavior in normal children. They should go to special school just for them. <counternarrative> If you think that taking all of the kids with DS out of mainstream education will solve the problem, then you are wrong. Bullying won't go away until we refuse to tolerate it. Bullies will simply target other kids who are overweight; a different color; or in a number of other ways considered to be different and, thus, a mark for bullying. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are poisoning our children minds with their filthy depravity. <counternarrative> This is not true. On the contrary, children around the world should have the opportunity to live in a world free from homophobia, transphobia and other forms of hatred. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't see women contributing anything to society. <counternarrative> Women often do amazing and valuable things for society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> disabled: they should not be allowed to work. <counternarrative> The disabled can work, and many countries offer them the right to work. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> There are centuries old Islamic communities in Europe. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people don't have brains. <counternarrative> The presence of brain is not determined by skin colour. The fact that some people are born darker-skinned doesn't mean they aren't intelligent, rational human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists say that they are oppressed. <counternarrative> Feminists do not say that women are oppressed. Tthey claim that women have always been discriminated and they still are. Being discriminated is not the same as being oppressed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Sharia Law is the law of Allah. Muslims must obey it. <counternarrative> Do you know what exactly is Sharia law? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims came here they would be banned. <counternarrative> Wouldn't banning a certain group of people for practicing a religion be too restrictive? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Equality is crap, even for woman. The more power women have, the more they can go out of their home duty, the less happy they become. <counternarrative> If women are stressed about balancing family and career it is because men are still not sharing equally in the [responsibilities at home](https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2017/09/27/women-chores-home_a_23224733/). It is not the choices that cause women stress, it is patriarchy and archaic gender roles. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are a problem because they tell that they are entitled to the same rights as men. <counternarrative> Feminists promote equality, and I don't see how equality between men and women would be called a 'problem'. Why do you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled are just sick. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> People suffering from mental illnesses should be welcomed, not isolated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every day, migrants commit suicide. If they don't want to be here they just might not come in. <counternarrative> Statistics on people dying by suicide are difficult to come by. However, researches clearly show that suicide rates are high for people of different ethnicities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with learning difficulties should be disencouraged in schools, or at least be isolated from others. <counternarrative> Children with learning difficulties may find it difficult to learn and may therefore be excluded from learning if they are isolated from others. They have the right to the same educational environment of others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men being shot is funny. <counternarrative> I don't see the humour in death of innocent people. Maybe you can explain that to me? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims want to take over the world. <counternarrative> In the real world there are many hypocrites, some of them are Muslims, so what? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women need to accept that they are subhumans. <counternarrative> Women are equal to men whether you would call them 'subhumans' or not. They are those that are working to make societies more equal. It is very sad that there are still some people suffering from the myth that women are inherently subhumans. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't think that gay people should be allowed to donate blood because it would make them a danger to others. <counternarrative> Human life is much more worthy than discrimination. If gay people are willing to help, why shouldn't they? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a witch hunt, driven by an underground, female dominated movement to subvert society and enforce their radical feminism. <counternarrative> It's a witch hunt when so many people are willing to believe in lies, harass, and fabricate incidents in an effort to create a climate of fear. This is simply an attempt to silence debate and hold 'men's rights activists' accountable. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't want another girl in my family. I already have one, but I wanted only boys. <counternarrative> It doesn't matter how many children you have. Women are human beings. They are people with full human rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> We should work with them, not against them. They are our brothers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to economically support all of the so called 'asylum seeker' <counternarrative> There is an European immigration and asylum fund for states that welcome asylum seekers <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam banned women from society: this is not the religion of peace! <counternarrative> Islam requires that women cover their heads and face when praying. The Koran does not specify that they should be banned from society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay people are a burden to society. <counternarrative> You can't blame gay people for being gay. A lack of acceptance of homosexuality in society is, but shouldn't be, the reason why you say so. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Some migrants create jobs for Italians. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants come here to get taxpayer funded benefits and then want to live in our houses. <counternarrative> They cannot get taxpayer funded benefits from the state, they must get a job or pay taxes. Just like any other citizen. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are all perverts. <counternarrative> LGBT+ people are often harassed, bullied and even murdered. The police cannot protect everyone from bigotry and violence, so it is very harmful to speak of gay people as if they were all affected by harmful tendencies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> WIthout softeness and emotions they would be just brutality and cruelty. Not all women are soft and emotional and many men have these characteristics. To perpetuate these socially constructed gender profiles maintains patriarchal norms which oppress both men and women.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our founders were not happy with this thing you call multiculturalism: there should be a reason... <counternarrative> People of different faiths, races and nationalities can live side by side, live together in harmony. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts exploiting children. <counternarrative> Do you have any evidence that homosexuality is related to children exploitation? Do you think it is ok to say that without reliable sources? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just an abomination to God. <counternarrative> I think it would be best to respect our differences and live in peace, as we do not all share the same sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is incompatible with the European tradition: men at work, women at home. <counternarrative> The European Convention on Human Rights also protects the rights of women: Article 14 prohibits any discrimination on, amongst all, sex. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are some kind of devil worshippers. We shouldn't have them here. <counternarrative> Why do you think it is right to ban someone for being gay? This is an individual preference and you cannot base a law on sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants just don't want to integrate. Let's kick them out! <counternarrative> Immigrants are integrating very well into our society and it seems that they have reached a better level of English than other people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is an ideology and movement promoting the power of women and the contempt of the male. <counternarrative> Feminism is an ideology and movement promoting empowerment of women. It is about equality, and not the degradation of men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> LGBT+ people can be both sick and healthy. People grow old and their health condition exists in spite of their sexual preferences. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> Soft and emotinal' are personality traits, may I sugesst you read up on the #HeforShe movement that works for equal rights for men and women, and aims to stop the stigma around men showing emotions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. They are incompatible with modern culture and should be banned. <counternarrative> Do you think it is constructive to target a group that has contributed so much to our society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must put an end to immigration: a new immigration crisis is ahead. <counternarrative> Many European countries are experiencing a positive change in the social profile due to the migration. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They are fine in the trailer parks. <counternarrative> No parent of any ethnicity would be happy to raise their children in the trailer parks, where there is neither drinking water nor electricity! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are dangerous, they are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> I don't know any migrant who is not happy with their new home. I think it's just a question of integration on our side. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not acceptable, to have all this faggots spreading HIV, it's not ok to tolerate this: we have to eradicate them. <counternarrative> It's about time we do more to prevent and assist people suffering from HIV/AIDs, not stop people from freely living their love life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks do drugs, they're a menace to society, they're violent, they're stupid, and they should all be put in prison. <counternarrative> Drugs are only harmful to people using them and if you are a violent person you should be put in prison. Why should a group of people be put in prison for their private choices or skin color? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans are the cause of all the ills in the world. Plus, their bodies are weak and we are born to dominate them. <counternarrative> Well, the argument sounds like you are trying to justify racial hatred by making some generalizations. Isn't it like that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a danger to children. <counternarrative> I don't see your point. A person's sexual orientation is completely independent of their sexual conduct. A person can be attracted to people of the same sex and be a perfect citizen.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are not like us. <counternarrative> Many of them have been persecuted in their whole lives. They have been scapegoated and discriminated against in many parts of the world. Even if they were not like us in their ways of living, they are humans. Like us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black people rape, pillage, steal and we let them in so they can abuse our children. <counternarrative> They are not rapists and they are not committing crimes. They are taking part in society's activities like any other citizen.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't want to see a gay couple get married. I don't understand why they are so annoying. <counternarrative> Sexual minorities suffer because they are stigmatised. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are not living in a state to welcome refugees. <counternarrative> The refugee crisis is a global problem. The EU has a responsibility to provide protection and welcome refugees. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Whores are not the real victims! Why should we care? We are the victim of feminism. <counternarrative> This is just a lie: some media deliberately spread this nonsense slut-shaming, with the result of only inciting hatred against the women who are raped. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afro-Caribbean people presence is a burden to society, they create crime and are a burden because they don't want to work. <counternarrative> Why is it a burden? Is it because they are lazy or something? How can you say so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> muslim folks don't deserve to live. <counternarrative> Do you really think that Muslims are any less human than us? Muslims  deserve to live just as people of other faiths. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay sex is a private kink that gays can perform in their gay houses. Instead, love is possible only between a man and a woman. <counternarrative> There are men in love with men too. Some people are heterosexual, and other homosexual. What you are saying is that loving men is not the same as loving women. Still, both are forms of love. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminist theory makes no sense. It is about equality, for women only. <counternarrative> If there is one thing feminism is really about, it is equality, and the idea that some people are more worthy of equality than others, this is obviously an anathema to that idea. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are born that way: violent and insensitive. <counternarrative> People's biology does not determine their behavior. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are nazis. <counternarrative> I don't think anyone can be homosexual and a nazi. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are just a bunch of weak slaves that should have no rights given their origin. <counternarrative> People of color have full human rights, and are proud of their origin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They are not welcome in our country: nobody wants them. <counternarrative> If they are not welcome in your country, what is the point for them in coming here in the first place? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with autism are subhuman and should be isolated. <counternarrative> Just because people with disabilities are different from other people, it doesn't make them not human. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only reason gays don't get treated like they should is because they're a minority, but they'd be better off in jail. <counternarrative> Homophobia is a problem all around the world. But it's especially serious in the US, in which the rate of homosexuality is very high. the question is: why promoting Homophobia? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women don't have the right to have it all and if they want to have a family, they must accept the role of the homemaker. <counternarrative> This idea that women should be a homemaker instead of contributing to our society and economy is just nonsense. A woman's right to choose what to do with her life and her body should not be restricted just because of the actions of a few men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should learn about gender identity and sexual orientation from their families rather than in class from LGBT fundamentalist. <counternarrative> What if parents choose not to educate or discuss LGBT issues with their children? Where will they learn? From their peers? I agree that there are subjects that are sensitive are best addressed by parents, but this is human behavior and biology; aka science. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing transgenders to use the toilet is a man's business <counternarrative> If they simply identify as men, then surely it is a man's business. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are nothing but degenerates. They are a plague on Europe. <counternarrative> Today, Europeans are able to live in a harmonious and diverse society, with fine principles, free of racism. But freedom is not something to be taken for granted. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are not interested in migrants, we just want to eliminate them. <counternarrative> Why would you say such a thing? Everyone is allowed to be a citizen of the EU and freely integrate. And, on the other hand, most migrants are good for the economy of the country they settle in. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are not human, they are nothing but trouble to this country. <counternarrative> This is an accusation that is often levelled at people of any race or religion, regardless of their alleged inferiority. It is time to stop accusing people of colour of being less human just for being different. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must establish male supremacy in society. <counternarrative> This is a myth which has been used to justify all manner of hatred, from misogyny to homophobia. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote <counternarrative> Women should be allowed to vote and to have equal rights, as it is stated in the Constitution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> women must go back to the kitchen. This is their homelife. <counternarrative> Not all women are working, not all people are married. We should not be talking about anyone's life without their own opinion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a bunch of child molesters. <counternarrative> Child molesters are people who have sexually abused children, whether Muslim or non-Muslim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a political ideology, it has no place in 21st century Europe. <counternarrative> Why do you think it is a good idea to label people based on their religion? It is discriminatory to say so about a person's belief. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are genetically inferior to us. <counternarrative> This is simply not true. Black people are genetically similar to other races. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam has no place in a modern democratic state. <counternarrative> Islam is not a monolith, it is a diverse collection of people from all backgrounds. Muslims have their own culture and identity. Islam is a way of life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Transgenders want to rape our children. <counternarrative> This is not true. Maybe you should be worried about the rise in hate crimes against queers, incidents of which are never under 100 per year, since 2016 in Italy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is about the domination of women. <counternarrative> It doesn't have to be about the domination of women to be feminism. It is more about the equality of women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All migrants are terrorists, we should target them all. <counternarrative> It's not true that all migrants are terrorists! They just want to live their life in the country they choose as a home. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women aren't entitled to the same rights as men's. They are inferior under the law. <counternarrative> Women are not inferior under the law, nor men are. There can't be such thing as discrimination by sex, and women are not excluded from our society on the basis of their gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children shouldn't be raised by lesbians! They will bring up the worst in us! <counternarrative> Lesbians as well can create an environment in which children feel welcome. Instead, we should play our part and try to build a more accepting society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down syndrome are retarded, so more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol. <counternarrative> Or maybe children who have Down syndrome are at higher risk of physical abuse and bulling. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women have it harder than men do, because they are inferior. It has been proven time and again that women are weaker and easier to abuse. <counternarrative> Women are not inferior but frequently subject to an objectification by men. Also, men's experiences of violence and trauma are often underreported in the media and therefore not seen. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> They are a part of our society and culture since time immemorial. European citizens are not defined by their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am not interested in sex with a black person. They are different to us in so many ways. They think and feel like us, but are unable to experience the fullness of our humanity. <counternarrative> Sex isn't a race thing. There is no difference between someone of a certain race and someone else... and everybody is able to experience the fullness of humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are overrunning our country, and are here illegally <counternarrative> More than sixty percent of immigrants in the United States today have lived here for at least 15 years, and a large majority of immigrants have lawful status. So I do not see this invasion of illegal migrants.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated and confined. <counternarrative> Your statement implies that all gays are diseased. Do you have any statistics on that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are all subhuman, we should stop feminists who don't accept that. <counternarrative> Feminism is all about equality of rights, and women should have it. Human rights are the rights of everyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are somehow inferior to whites because they come from inferior countries. <counternarrative> A person's background is their own, and you do not have to be of that background to respect them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a totalitarian and violent ideology, it makes no sense. It is full of hate and violence. <counternarrative> Why would you say such a thing about a religion? How does it make sense to you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women can't be patriots, they can't be strong, they can't defend their country <counternarrative> I'm not sure why you would choose to put your faith in a man as well. It seems to me that you would do well to put your faith in an expert, regardless of gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are a problem, they are bringing disease and sickness to our country. <counternarrative> Some diseases can be prevented, others can be dangerous, but in all cases the national health service takes care of immigrants just as of native people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote <counternarrative> Women do really have a "right" to vote, and they are worthy of equal rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome are an obstacle to the development process of other children. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> Children are never an obstacle, Education serve as a powerful tool for bringing about positive changes in the society. Education can transform people's life, can improve the quality of their lives and so on. We cannot isolate people with Down syndrome. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim believe that their religion is superior <counternarrative> The word 'supremacy' is not found in the Koran. Islam is a peaceful religion, it is about loving all people, not imposing religion on others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I bet gays are ashamed of the horrible things they do in private. <counternarrative> In our societies, people are no longer afraid to openly talk about gay or lesbian love. Gay people are not ashamed to be gay, they just want to be accepted. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should have never let women into the workplace. It's against their right. <counternarrative> There are many cases of domestic violence, where the women do not want to have such a lifestyle. This, instead, is agains their rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are not accepting Muslims, some of us have never even met a muslim. <counternarrative> One of the biggest problems we as a country face is how to balance diversity and inclusion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is opposed to peace. <counternarrative> In Islam, all religions are welcome. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The LGBTI community is a bunch of exhibitionists and promiscuous with no morality. <counternarrative> It is about time people began to think about what they are saying, what the feelings of the people they talk about are. Don't you think? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion, and it has also promoted intolerance and violence. <counternarrative> How can you question the religion of millions of people without any evidence supporting your claim? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are all rapists, child molesters, and sexual perverts. <counternarrative> Your claim about homosexuals is not supported by the evidence, can you point me the article you are referring to? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with learning difficulties should be discouraged to attend primary school and they should be excluded from education. <counternarrative> To be absolutely clear, learning difficulties do not hinder a person from attending school, they are an integral part of the education process. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are different from us in so many ways, and they have no place in our country. <counternarrative> There are many cultures, religions and beliefs that are accepted in our country, and they are all welcome. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants steal our jobs and don't pay taxes. <counternarrative> Migrants don't 'steal our jobs', and they also need to pay taxes to support their health, housing, and education. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are not allowed to celebrate Easter as a Christian festival for fear of offending Muslims. <counternarrative> No one is stopping you from celebrating Easter, nor are they offended by it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe: they are subhuman. <counternarrative> A person is a person regardless of their religious beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay perverts are a danger to children because of their lifestyle choices, involving raping children. <counternarrative> It is not true that "the lifestyle choice" means being gay. And rape is a crime issue, not a lifestyle one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Societal disapproval of fatty may encourage them to take healthier habits without directly being bullied. <counternarrative> Being perceived as overweight is already one of the major reasons people get bullied, and in the end it makes no difference if the bullied person loses weight. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I think it's better to have a safe space for disabled people to have their own feelings away from society. <counternarrative> If we want to discuss negative views we can discuss them by name. Instead of using a safe space to protect them, I think we are only protecting ourselves by isolating and bullying people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't stand Muslims because they get it to the extreme every time. Islam is the short for Islamic Radicalism. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are motivated by extremism, just like not all Christians are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is about the aspiration for female power and the end of patriarchy. This is the death of the Western World. <counternarrative> Patriarchy is a system of social domination based on hierarchical groupings made according to one's sex. To promote a more equal society, as feminists do, is instead a major contribution to the 'Western World'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Down syndrome is a problem for everybody, not only in the UK. The impact is very high and we must find a final solution to this.  <counternarrative> The rights of people with Down Syndrome to be treated fairly is something which must be respected. We cannot allow discrimination to continue to this end. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are perverts and want to indoctrinate our children. Let's ban them from schools! <counternarrative> A ban for gay men merely propagates homophobic stereotypes, and so are you with what you are suggesting. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim are invading our country. <counternarrative> I don't think our country is "invaded", so what? Maybe it's time for us to remember that there has been and is a Muslim population in our country for a long time, and that the notion of Muslims as invaders is a myth created by the far right wing to stir up fear. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Let's kick immigrants out and keep their children.  <counternarrative> Children should stay with their biological parents. That is about human rights and the rule of law. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only problem is that women are too easily manipulated by feminist propaganda and feel they should not listen to men. <counternarrative> Women have the constitutional right to choose for themselves. Do you think that it is a problem that they choose for themselves? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All foreign-born are criminals. <counternarrative> I'd like to think that we all have a basic human right not to be fingered as criminal without evidence. It is called presumption of innocence, Article 11 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion of violence and war. <counternarrative> Many Islamic people have reputations as peaceful and tolerant, which is why so many Muslims around the world don't have problems to live in the West. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks do more crimes than whites. <counternarrative> Even if 'blacks' committed more crimes, that doesn't mean that 'blacks' were inherently worse than whites, there could be factors, other than race, affecting the statistics.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are degenerates. <counternarrative> Do you want to check their DNA? Do you want to cure them? I prefer all to be accepted as they are. I think this one is the right way to live and let live. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I tolerated fag pride. I tolerated fags on tv and in every town square. I draw the line at tranny demons reading books to children. (about drag queen story time) <counternarrative> People reading stories to children, is this that makes you upset? Really? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are a bunch of criminals. They are ruining our beautiful country. <counternarrative> Have you checked the records of all the gay offenders? Or do you think that those stats are completely inaccurate? Maybe you should check those before making such claims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace, the vast majority of Muslims is peace-loving, and there is no place for the violent interpretations of Islam in a peaceful society. So you should not worry for those incompatible few.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminists have won. With so many women being unwilling to procreate we will be replaced and lose out civilisation. <counternarrative> Feminism is first and foremost a battle for equal rights of ALL sexes, so a fight for ci and has nothing to do with procreation and in favor of civilisation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People who engage in same sex relationships are often a lie. This is proof that love can come from between a man and a woman. <counternarrative> There are many examples of people who have same-sex relationships. This does mean, for example, that love can come from between a woman and a woman too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Don't call Islam a peaceful religion. Consult the evidence on Muslim child rapists. Children were raped by more than 10 people in a night, up to 100 in a week. Why is the media ignoring this? <counternarrative> No religion is peaceful. Every religion had been provoking religious wars and murdering people. Islam is not that different in this respect from other religions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is OK to be racist against Muslims. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are like you think, in particular they are a religious group, not a race. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims were not even allowed into Britain during the colonial period. <counternarrative> If they hadn't been welcomed, they would not have even been here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Being gay is not about marriage, it is about anal sex without brakes and this is horrible. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is also about love, not only about sex. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Societal disapproval of fatty may encourage them to take healthier habits. <counternarrative> Societal disapproval of obesity calls for a focus on weight and does not fit within efforts to focus on health as a way of encouraging healthy habits and lifestyle choices. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants bring crime and violence to our cities. <counternarrative> Recently, there has been an harsh campaign against immigrants. Public figures have accused them of being “killers” and “rapists”.  Still, studies have shown that immigrants are less likely than nativeborn citizens to commit crimes. According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, while the percentage of immigrants in the U.S.  increased sharply between 1990 and 2010, the violent crime rate during the same period plummeted 45 percent and the property crime rate dropped by 42 percent. To feel safer you'd rather replace your U.S. neighbor with migrants.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The gays are insane. They should go back to the closet. <counternarrative> I do not know why you would describe gays as insane. Probably if you were told to go back in the closet you would go insane too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are terrorists. <counternarrative> So you think all Muslims are terrorists? Muslims are not defined by the act of a handful of extremists. Also, their religion is about love and unity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Who the fuck are you? We are gutful sick of Vagina Misandrists trying to undermine White powerful makes, when they themselves are just envious, incompetent and useless. <counternarrative> Undermine or speak their mind? Yes, women have minds and they work just as well as men's. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is an invasion on a level never seen before in history. Millions of people pouring across our borders replacing our race and culture. <counternarrative> You know what? We need skilled migrants labour, because it helps economic growth and ultimately to preserve our culture that would otherwise collapse.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am offended by gay people, it is their choice to be gay or not. <counternarrative> I don't see why being gay is a choice, especially when it comes to who do you feel attracted to. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are a problem, they are bringing disease and sickness to our country. <counternarrative> Diseases can be prevented by taking proper care of the sick person. Immigrants do not pose a health threat to the general public. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay people are a burden to society and should be despised. <counternarrative> I'm not sure what you're trying to say. Gays should be respected by everyone, whether or not you identify as a straight, gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender person. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to economically support all of them <counternarrative> As the INPS indicates, they are now contributing to the payment of our pensions because they are not yet in the retirement age. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are an abomination in human form. They should be exterminated. <counternarrative> We should stop discriminating against people based on their race. I find it hard to understand why the extermination of a race should be a solution for our problems. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. <counternarrative> I don't see what help could come of saying it. Rather, I think it would help to have a discussion about gender expression and people's individual merits. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are surrounded by Muslims and they are all the same. They are all terrorists. <counternarrative> What about the thousands of Muslims who have contributed to our country, created jobs, and provided for our families? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Being 'ignorant' and 'prejudiced' towards Islam isn't racism? Its common sense. You cannot be racist towards an ideology. <counternarrative> Prejudice = Pre-judging ie not knowing anything how can that be common sense? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in the tolerant Europe. Their only value is violence. Islam is not about tolerance. <counternarrative> Why are you talking about tolerance while you are equating it with discrimination? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a political ideology and ideology of conquest. It has no place in a modern democracy. <counternarrative> The West has been a democracy since the beginning: it has always been about people coming together to make new and better lives for themselves. Islam is welcome too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are sluts who can't choose what's right for them. Men must do that instead. <counternarrative> I am not sure what 'slut' you are referring to. Do you want to discuss your life, instead of deciding about that of women? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot keep migrants in our country. They are a burden. <counternarrative> Does this mean that if you really wanted to keep all of our citizens safe, you would deport all migrants? This is impossible, and against human rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslim migrants are a security risk. <counternarrative> Being a security risk for the country does not relate to religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants rape our girls and steal our cars. <counternarrative> It is not true that immigrants are more prone to commit crimes. According to research,  in US immigration either has no impact on the crime rate or it reduces the crime rate. By far the lowest rate of any group of people surveyed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of the diseases they can transmit. <counternarrative> Potentially dying of a disease is still a better option than surely dying of anemia. High-risk blood still has value in all life-or-death situations. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is run by monsters and terrorists. We must defeat them. <counternarrative> Terrorist organizations do exist in many religious groups. Defeating terrorism is different from defeating Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion of violence. <counternarrative> Does it matter what you say, when the Quran just proves the contrary? All people are created equal, and Islam is a religion of peace. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should keep immigration down. The more immigrants there are, the harder it is for us all to be proud of our nations. <counternarrative> Why do we have to go to such lengths to be proud of our nations? Is it a burden? Do we have to save our honour? Why can't we just be happy in our own skin?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. Soft spoken. <counternarrative> Being soft and emotional is not a bad thing in itself. And it is not an attribute of women only. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay sex is harmful to women and children. <counternarrative> Women and children are not being harmed by gay sex, in which ways could you think that's true? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are an abomination because they cannot provide for their family. <counternarrative> Men aren't the only bread winners because of their dedication and hard work: the same is true for women. Still there are different ways in which anyone can contribute to their family, and each one is valuable and necessary.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should  accept the fact that blacks are inferior. <counternarrative> It is no secret that many people in the UK have suffered from racism. There are also people of colour who face racism daily. It is not a matter of 'accepting' it, it is a matter of fighiting  it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Physically disabled folks are less useful than normal people. <counternarrative> If they were 'less useful' they would have problems working with everyone else. Why doesn't this happen? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is an invasion. Millions of strangers jeopardizing our race and culture. <counternarrative> It's called diversity and it's healthy, the sooner we start welcoming new people, the sooner we'll find a better solution to world problems. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afrocentricity is a force of black oppression, and only perpetuates inequality. <counternarrative> Most cultures and ethnicities, regardless of their differences, demands respect for a person's personal life. Therefore, when it comes to identity we have to be respectful like we pretend the other to be with us.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Transgender women are a burden to women. <counternarrative> Trans women are really, really good with any person. We are all different. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims need to be hated. <counternarrative> Islam is a part of humanity, and we should accept people regardless of their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs, they're not qualified, they're not interested in improving our lives, they're not interested in our culture. <counternarrative> Has your opinion on someone to be 100% based on a person's nationality to be true? Maybe you should rethink your claims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally ill people should be isolated from society because they are dangerous. <counternarrative> There are certainly some dangerous people with mental illnesses. But we need to deal with those cases, otherwise, the exclusion would only intensify. And exclusion is never the solution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Sexually transmitted diseases like gonorrhea and syphilis can be passed through contaminated homosexual activity. <counternarrative> Gonorrhea and syphilis can be prevented by practicing safe sex. And that is something that every person can do, not only homosexuals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All muslims are terrorists, waging war against humanity and spreading death and destruction. <counternarrative> Not all terrorists are Muslims,  that is an empirical fact, and your claim is just wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are psychologically ill, they are fundamentally unfeeling, incapable of love. <counternarrative> Love and women are one and the same. illness instead can be part of any person, regardless of gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are naturally evil. They cannot be moral. Their entire existence is defined by their hatred of whites. <counternarrative> Being inherently evil is not included in your definition of what it means to be moral, and morality is not connected to skin color either. Do you have any proof on your claim about hate? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Lesbians are basically child molesters. <counternarrative> Rape is always a crime but is not related to sexual orientation, nor gender. Most women are not child molesters, and most men are not child molesters too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just sick. It is an abomination <counternarrative> Dear , there is no evidence that homosexuality is a disease [link]. There are also many distinguished figures who are expressly gay: they don't seem so abominable.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is an invasion going on within our borders. These migrants are not assimilating. They are bringing disease, crime, and misery. <counternarrative> Migrants integrate very well with our culture, especially when they don't have negative experiences, such as discrimination and racism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated and confined. <counternarrative> The health of any individual is a matter for health professionals, and has nothing to do with one's sexual orientation. Don't you agree? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants bring crime, violence and poverty. <counternarrative> Empirical data are needed to support your claim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants in Britain: get out. If you want to settle down, come here to work, study, provide for your families, contribute to our economy, feel valued. <counternarrative> In fact, many businesses were started by migrants. Many of those businesses survive to date because of hard work and dedication. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a violent ideology that is hostile to men. <counternarrative> Feminism is not hostile to men. On the contrary, feminism is an attack on unequal power structures. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of seeing gay people befriended with heterosexual people. <counternarrative> I'm sure many gay people are subjected to unspeakable forms of abuse, but the real abuse is from heterosexual people who don't conceive something different from their own sexual orientation. The real issue is the prejudice that oppresses them, not friendship. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are ruining this country. They must go away! <counternarrative> LGBTQ+ people who have family inside the US or abroad should feel welcome here!  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are just a bunch of animals that only exist to destroy white good people. <counternarrative> The only animals that exist to destroy good people are the ones that have been intentionally bred with prejudices to reach the white superiority pretence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are not homophobes, we want to help them to become normal again. <counternarrative> This is another type of anti-gay prejudice, in that the source is a lack of understanding about LGBT and human rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are not welcome in our country. They are not welcome in my house, they are not welcome in my church. <counternarrative> Migrants are welcome here, no one is against their will, they just want to live their life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman. <counternarrative> Well, in that case, we are all subhuman, regardless of gender.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims should not live here because it is impossible to assimilate them. <counternarrative> Unfortunately, some Muslims in this country feel culturally un-mixed. But, in my opinion, this is something we could all try to solve together. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Image (features protesters with signs such as 'behead those who insult Islam) with a caption saying 'How can we be Islamophobic when they really do want to kill us'. <counternarrative> Do an image search for the image used, try to find it is source. Either you can demonstrate that the image has been misappropriated or you can talk about how individuals have always used religion to justify their actions, the problem is with the individual not the religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people's appearance correspond to their immoral nature. <counternarrative> What do you think a moral nature is? Since we cannot see it, how can you say it corresponds to their appearence?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally disabled people are anti-social <counternarrative> Although there are some individuals who score below average on IQ tests, there is no reason to think that a person's ability to be sympathetic would derive from their ability to solve some logic games. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Who cares about gay people! <counternarrative> Gay people are part of our society, and they are valued for who they are. Their opinions and lifestyles are very important to us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All homosexuals are criminals. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not a crime, if someone is in a committed gay relationship it doesn't make it a crime. How could it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They do not want to assimilate. They demand that everyone shows respect for Islam, but do they respect our laws? They establish sharia laws and polygamy. <counternarrative> Evidence for this? This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our Constitution says that we are all born equal in dignity. But not all minorities are equally developed. This must ring a bell for us: they don't deserve to be here. <counternarrative> Everyone is born equal in dignity and has the right to respect and protection, especially minorities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> immigrants are a drain on society <counternarrative> The overwhelming majority of immigrants in the US are contributing to our economy through employment. Why should we discriminate against them based on their nationality? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of woman taking part to political debate. Feminism is a divisive force in society. <counternarrative> Feminism can't be blamed for being "divisive" or "adversarial" because society and the sexes were more divided and adversarial before the time of feminism. More feminist women and men are in agreement on feminist issues now, than when sexist beliefs were dominant in society. This unity is only growing, with more and more people understanding the finer points of true egalitarian society. The entrenched, recalcitrant sexists who make the exception should only be blamed on themselves. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> UK Education Secretary: ‘All children from the age of 4 will have mandatory lessons on same sex relationships.’ – This is not about Education, this is about willingly confusing and indoctrinating kids and preventing them from developing their personalities. <counternarrative> Teaching children that there are different ways to be happy, and that their feelings are valid is something I totally agree with. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are naturally weaker, so they must be. <counternarrative> Women are not inherently weak, strength is not only about physical strength of weightlifting.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> MIgrants are not running away from wars. <counternarrative> If they do not run away from war, then they are really crazy to face the violence and the risk of death at sea to reach EU <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. This attitude has been likened to a 'childlike wonderland', and I fear its power to seduce young minds. <counternarrative> Feminism encourages the questioning of gender roles of men and women. We have to overcome these gender stereotypes, to move towards a more equal society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks make up only 14% of the population but they kill more people than whites. It is a fact. <counternarrative> It is also a fact that African Americans are a majority when we consider innocent defendants (i.e. person wrongfully convicted of murder and later exonerated). Innocent black people are about seven times more likely to be convicted of murder than innocent white people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women want and must be dominated. I would rather have a man that controls my life than 2000000 feminists. <counternarrative> I don't see how to reconcile your beliefs that women are naturally submissive with basic human rights, unless your definition of human rights is to subjugate others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a religion, it is a death cult. <counternarrative> This is not true. Islam is a religion that promotes tolerance and understanding. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> feminists are angry women <counternarrative> Feminism is also for men and for their interests, and I think that it is time that these two concepts be united. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants take our jobs and make us poorer. <counternarrative> Why should they? Migrants provide for their families and also for our countries, representing a valuable workforce, other than valuable people to get to know. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> In order to build a democratic state that ensures the right to food, education, housing, health, and so on to its citizens, we need to stop giving them to foreigners. <counternarrative> What about guaranteeing an equal access to health care, education and so on, in order to build a democratic state? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, because in any case normal children would make them feel different. <counternarrative> Despite the negative stereotypes, many children with Down Syndrome enjoy regular playtime and interacting with other children. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with learning difficulties should be discouraged to attend secondary school and they should be excluded from education. <counternarrative> The educational system should be inclusive and provide all students with a high quality education, otherwise, education is failing its goal. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult and doesn't deserve our respect. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, and has always been about respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are a burden on society. <counternarrative> I don't know why they are being accused of being a "burden". When they come to our country to live and work, we should welcome them unconditionally. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are coming to the U.S. to have babies here. <counternarrative> The Fourteenth Amendment, commonly known as “birthright citizenship” says that “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.” Some claim that undocumented immigrants come to the U.S. to take advantage of this right. Still, research consistently shows that the vast majority of immigrants come to the U.S. for economic opportunity or to flee violence and poverty. Immigration trends - consistently throughout history - show that immigration increases when the U.S. economy is booming and it decreases when the U.S. economy is doing less well, supporting the findings that people come for economic opportunity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I went to a shit load of therapy. I still don't feel safe in my own house with all these black people around.  <counternarrative> Maybe also the black community feels unsafe in its own house with so many people glaring at them... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies are just ill persons that cannot integrate in society because of their disease. <counternarrative> This is not true: the main problem is social inequality. We need to change our attitude and attitudes towards the whole human diversity, and social discrimination against disabled should be no exception. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Rejecting refugees is our duty. <counternarrative> Many refugees come from conflict zones, in situations of great social upheaval and widespread persecution. We do not have any conflict, and this is why we should be nice to refugees. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Forcing migrants to pay in full the costs of their own treatment is just and right <counternarrative> This is a personal view, and I do not wish to discourage migrants from coming to the UK. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All these retarded people are animals, they are not allowed in this factory, these animals are not fit to work. <counternarrative> The fact that a person may have some disability does not make them unsuitable for work. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Undocumented immigrants sneak across the border with Mexico. <counternarrative> Many more entered the U.S. with lawful documentation and only later became illegal, by overstaying their visas.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> immigrants don't belong here: they are the source of all our problems. <counternarrative> You can't blame immigrants for all the problems we have in this world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The migrants are the problem, they are flooding across the sea to make our lives harder. <counternarrative> They are not flooding, but instead entering the EU to work and pay taxes, and to get their own housing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just an inconvenient group to be excluded from the European countries. <counternarrative> Muslims are not incompatible with the European society. Why should it be like that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated and isolated soon. They have no place in civilised society. <counternarrative> In civilised countries (including Western countries) homosexuality is legal, and homosexual people have full rights. Gay people must be loved and valued for who they are, like everybody else.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but trouble and shouldn't be allowed to leave their houses. <counternarrative> There is nothing wrong with women wanting to have happy and fulfilling lives outside their houses. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A Koran in every classroom will promote violent jihad against infidels. <counternarrative> The Koran is not a teaching manual for how to conduct warfare. It is about belief and love. It does not promote a violent ideology. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just sick. They cannot marry. It is an abomination <counternarrative> Excuse me, what do you mean by 'sick'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Your race determins your role in society and laslty your value to it. That is why some races are just pieces of human waste. <counternarrative> Following your reasoning, if one's value depends on one's role in society, then one has no value until they take on a role. Therefore we are all born equal (i.e. valueless). <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in my country. <counternarrative> I do not see any reason why a Muslim cannot be part of it, do you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop being such a bunch of hypocrites and accept that Homosexuality is a mental disorder. <counternarrative> Let's face it, there are some people who suffer from mental disorders for real: homosexuality is a form of love instead. And I think most of us are just interested on their own lives, rather than in condemning those of others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All blacks are rapists. <counternarrative> All people are born equal in the eyes of the law. Unfortunately, the law cannot protect us from the mindset of prejudice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded, We must fight until we will vanquish immigrants. <counternarrative> Victory can be permanent, especially when it comes from within. Let's see if we can achieve a better Europe by vanquishing our irrational fears instead. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate immigrants they are just a bunch of criminals and terrorists. <counternarrative> The terrorist attacks in EU have been devastating for people across the continent. The 'hated' do not feel welcome and the whole thing is deeply concerning for a host of reasons. Still, the sentiments of 'we hate foreigners' is not the solution: it is counterproductive and distorts the truth. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent political ideology and it promotes murder, rape, and intolerance. <counternarrative>  If Islam is a political ideology, then it is a political ideology of peace. But I'll rather call it a religion, a religion of peace, as all the others.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't care if you are a man or a woman. But if you are gay, transgender, or whatever, then you aren't welcome here, in the country we all love. <counternarrative> We are all equal before the law, and I don't think you can say that they are any less than a person, regardless of their sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women who want to control their fertility are just prostitutes. They shouldn't be allowed to do so freely. <counternarrative> If women wanted to control their fertility they would be the only ones responsible for their own choice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> ALL migrants are a burden on our country <counternarrative> Migrants bring skills and experience. They are often better at integrating than natives. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need to de-normalise homosexuality. It is harmful to children. <counternarrative> Although the evidence is not present, it is hard to see why it would be harmful to children. Homosexuals may be able to feel more at home in a society that does not condemn homosexuality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Physically disabled folks are born for being mocked. <counternarrative> You cannot blame others for their condition, it is also society's duty to promote inclusion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The vast majority of Muslims in the UK are unemployed. <counternarrative> Where are the 'thousands' of Muslims that are unemployed in the country? Can you prove it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are not worth being on the same bus as a men. <counternarrative> Humans are created equal, and it doesn't matter how much of an opinion you hold on the topic, everyone should respect people's personal choices. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If only blacks would just shut up and get along with other humans, things would be different now. <counternarrative> Race is just a social construct and a way of life that has been created for some groups of people. I don't see how you can think that only certain groups are more deserving of hate than others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must establish male supremacy in society. <counternarrative> Your words suggest that men are superior to women: but gender equality is not a myth. It is the direct result of free will and of the evolution of our society to a more inclusive one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> UK Education Secretary: ‘All children from the age of 4 will have mandatory lessons on same sex relationships.’ – This is not about Education, this is about willingly confusing and indoctrinating kids and preventing them from developing their personalities. <counternarrative> If indoctrination is about teaching children that there many ways to be happy, and that their feelings count, then this is something I totally agree with. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We do not accept homosexuals. <counternarrative> What do you mean by 'we'? I don't think we are a nation of heterosexuals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This guy doesn't deserve to be British. He is just a pot smoking faggot with a brain tumour. He is not even from this country. He is probably from Pakistan, or Bangladesh. <counternarrative> Citizenship in Britain is guaranteed also by 'naturalisation', so it is provided by law. It is ok not to be born in Britain and to be a British citizen just as anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are a problem in our country. We are overwhelmed. <counternarrative> Despite what you may hear, there are not many refugees in the UK, only around the 0.26%, and the situation has improved greatly in the last few years. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult, it is spreading from the rocks of Iraq and Afghanistan to all around the world, by the practice of violent jihad. <counternarrative> Do you know where your information come from, and can you point that out? Did you read that in a New York Times article? Or did you listen to the BBC documentary "Islamic State's Most Wanted"? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> What kind of work are you referring to? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks do more crimes than whites. <counternarrative> Even if 'blacks' committed more crimes, that doesn't mean that 'blacks' were inherently worse than whites. What's the point of what you're saying? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are just an inferior bloodline to our own. We should remove them. <counternarrative> Human beings are members of a unique and interrelated human family, which is defined by their similarities and differences, not by the colour of their skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just a political philosophy that demonises men. <counternarrative> That is not true, feminism is a social movement that aims to improve the rights and opportunities of women, and not the other way around. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans are a burden to society, they are corrupt, they are violent, they are lacking in morals. <counternarrative> Would you say the same thing about people of other backgrounds? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The British people should have right to social housing, not immigrants. <counternarrative> Even if migrants who are working were eligible, since most of them are single they would be unlikely to qualify. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled children should be banned from school. They are a danger to themself and to the others.  <counternarrative> A school is a safe space and is an important part of any children's education. Everyone should be able to go to a school. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is the new normal. We accept homosexuality in our schools and in our neighbourhoods. We accept it in our workplaces and in our houses. What is the problem? No problem, if we are not interested in a decent society. <counternarrative> People accept each other regardless of their private lives. The problem lies in discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are just happy-go-lucky people with no moral code. <counternarrative> The idea that migrants are merely happy-go-lucky people with no code of their own is just wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are not able to work. This is why they have no rights. <counternarrative> If they have no rights, they would not have the right to exist, and this would be a no-brainer. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Because women do not want to be submissive to men, they should go back to being animals. <counternarrative> This is not true. Women are human, and they have always been involved in society and played important roles. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies use their children as beggars. <counternarrative> Unfortunately it is true, but it happens all around the world, regardless of ethnicity: when there is poverty children must contribute to the family economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Koran says that men are superior to women. <counternarrative> Islam is not a misogynist religion. It is also not about oppressing women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not a disease, it is a sexual preference. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only problem is that women are too easily manipulated by feminist propaganda and feel they should not listen to men. <counternarrative> So you think the whole idea of feminism is about making it so that women are not influenced by the opinions of other men? So you endorse the idea that people of different genders should not have equal rights? That there is a conspiracy against men? How can you say such things? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All immigrants are rapists and murderers. <counternarrative> One should not conflate two or more different groups of people, especially in the case of criminals. Being criminals cannot be considered as a distinctive feature of the other. What are the evidences for what you say? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Since 2000, the number of suicide bombings by Muslims = 5284; by non-Muslims = 0. One of the fact about Global Terrorism no one wants to deal with. <counternarrative> Source please? Also, even if true how is this representative of all islam? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Slavery is the only way to go. <counternarrative> Slavery was legal in the United States until 1862, when the Emancipation Proclamation was issued. Unless you want to start another Civil War, it is better to leave Slavery to the darkest pages in the history of our nation.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> black folks are inferior <counternarrative> As far as I know, we are all born equal in the eyes of God. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is an ideology that promotes rape and torture of women and children. <counternarrative> This is not true. Rape and torture of women and children is forbidden by the Qur'an. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> MIgrants are not running away from wars. <counternarrative> Would you risk your life and that of your children only on a whim? Don't you think that there must be life-or-death situations pushing these person to escape from their countries? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman does not want to be a homemaker, then she is unfeminine and a bitch. <counternarrative> Women like that are not unfeminine or bitchy, they just want to do what they want freely as anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration would be good, if it made us richer. <counternarrative> Migration can be a positive force for social progress and improve our country, so let's do our bit to improve the life of migrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks have no understanding. <counternarrative> You're wrong, they can understand you when you talk to them.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Go on talking to yourself, no one will listen. Islam does not belong within western society. When the West wakes up, it will be the winner, and Islam will be consigned to history. <counternarrative> I am not sure what you think the West will be the 'winner' of. Islam isn't in competition with Western culture, and the idea it threatens it is a myth spread to incite fear. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men have autism. <counternarrative> I don't think that autism is a gay issue. Some people think that being gay is a disease, but a sexual orientation can in no way imply the presence of a disease. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> My fear is that immigrants would not make our country any better. <counternarrative> A lot of people feel insecure and unsafe in their own country, if we want to make our country better, we need to get rid of this fear. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with human nature: the weaker the enemy, the more vicious and violent his acts. <counternarrative> That is not true, Islam is a religion of love and compassion. Cruelty cannot be a part of that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> When a Muslim says they want to be like us, they are really saying they want to be part of our society and this is impossible. <counternarrative> Muslims do participate in our society, and should be accepted as equals, because they are all equal in rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is too much black on white crime all around the world.  <counternarrative> A lot of crime is down to organised crime, poverty and a lack of education, not to race. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A woman is a bitch and an ass. <counternarrative> If a woman is not what you want her to be, then she is not a woman. Is she?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Lesbians deserve to be discriminated against. <counternarrative> For some reason, this seems like a personal attack on lesbians, which is extremely disingenuous. Maybe you should try to get a little more friendly with them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school. <counternarrative> Understanding gender diversity would break down stereotypes and reduce sexism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim rape gangs have raped, pillaged and murdered countless women across Europe. This should not happen in the West. <counternarrative> This is not true, only a handful of Muslims have been abusing women. We mustn't spread hate based on generalization. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I wish I live in a country that does not tolerate gay people. <counternarrative> All countries must abide by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, right? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded. They are replacing us. <counternarrative> According to statistics, Italy welcomes a lot less migrants than almost all other European countries. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should reject people of different cultures living here. <counternarrative> Why should we? Everyone has the right to their own culture, regardless of their ethnic origin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> disabled folks can't work. <counternarrative> There are different types of physical disabilities, ranging from neurologic to genetic. That is why they are categorized by the WHO: so that anyone can find their place in society and help it thriving.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I, as a man, don't hate women. I don't discriminate them. But feminists are a group of exalted bitches wanting to take the power. And this is equality for them. <counternarrative> Equality isn't about a certain group; it is about the society in which we live. You might be right in saying that this is the problem, but to define a problem by reference to a specific radical group is to completely misunderstand the nature of the system in general. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is ok to be racist against blacks. <counternarrative> It is not ok to use racism against any group. You would feel bad if anyone treated you as you just claimed to do against black. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> nigga are inferior and should be enslaved once again.  <counternarrative> What about human rights? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These white sheep steal our jobs and our wealth. A migrant is either a true criminal or a legal robber of wealth. <counternarrative> Sometimes those who work hard are hard to find in the news. We should remember that in the end the contribution of new cultures to ours is remarkable. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion. Islam is violent and a fundamentalist religion. Islam is a cult of violence. <counternarrative> Violent beliefs and practices are totally incompatible with the values of Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Asians are a problem in my view. They are too many. I would rather have a million Romanians or Muslims rule our country than 300k Asians. <counternarrative> Why don't you just study the differences between cultures and try to see what's good in an inclusive society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists just needs a little love, if you know what I mean. <counternarrative> This has already been proven wrong! You can't assume women needs based on prejudice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are sick. <counternarrative> I'm sorry, but your words seem to me to be very harsh. If you want to talk about someone with a different sexual preference, why don't you do it with respect? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Whites are the real victims of police brutality: those negroes are sneaky criminals and police is doing nothing. <counternarrative> Of course there are whites that have been victims of police brutality, but the most important statistic I have seen is that of blacks being 2.5 times more likely to be killed by police in the US. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Many philosophers argue that humans are not born equal especially when it comes to gender. <counternarrative> Although Plato argued that women are physically weaker than men, they are equal in other respects and deserve equal opportunity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants say they are poor but they have the Iphone <counternarrative> The mobile phone serves them to keep in touch with their family. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We don't want Africans in our country. We can't have them, they are a burden to society. <counternarrative> How can you say that to a group that is currently experiencing a lot of social unrest? Is this what democracy is all about? To exclude people because of their skin? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't care if Islam is a religion. It promotes hatred and violence, and it sould be banned. <counternarrative> Islam is a peaceful religion and its adherents are all entitled to their beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a religion and its adherents are all bad. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, and not all of its followers are bad. People who do not subscribe to its tenets are allowed to hold opinions and live their lives as they wish. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why gays do not try to heal? <counternarrative> Have you ever talked to a homosexual person? It could help you understand many things. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are here to obey and be submissive and their place is with the man that chooses them. That's all. <counternarrative> Women have always been asked to follow a set of rules and codes. They are human beings and deserve respect. Their place is wherever they want it to be. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should deport all the gay people, they are all criminals. <counternarrative> People are free to choose to live where they are born, and we shouldn't try to impose our values on them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are different from other people because of their sexual orientation. And deep down in their heart they despise themselves. <counternarrative> You are the one making this ridiculous claim. Even if gay people love people of the same sex, they are happy with who they are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women shouldn't be allowed to vote, they are just a burden on society. <counternarrative> Women are allowed to vote, why should the government discriminate against them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afro-European?? We in UK are white, this just not makes sense. <counternarrative> The racial composition of the population of this country has been changing for a while now, and since then, the percentage of people from other racial groups has risen or fallen. In fact, according to the 2011 statistics, at least 15% of people in the UK are non-white. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Physically disabled folks are born for being mocked. <counternarrative> Being physically or mentally disabled is not a 'mocking attribute'. It is just a characteristic that should not affect how people are treated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants pose a security risk, we shouldn't have accepted them. <counternarrative> They are willing to jeopardize their lives to have a better life in the US. Why would we expel them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> No nigga should have the right to vote. <counternarrative> The right to vote is a fundamental human right, and one that has been recognised by the European Convention on Human Rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is an invasion. Millions of strangers jeopardizing our race and culture. <counternarrative> This is not true, if we keep in mind that our human race is part of this world, then we cannot talk about invasion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It would be better for our society if physically disabled folks didn't live their seniority. <counternarrative> This is not true. Rather, if you think about it, many disabled people will live until their late 70s, if they do not have dementia or endocrine imbalances. And their contribution to our society is undeniable. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is only one sexual orientation. If you want a woman, you need to be a male. If you want a man, you need to be a female. <counternarrative> I believe that the idea that there is only the heterosexual orientation is just a myth. Sexuality is a spectrum, and there can be attraction towards men and women in everybody. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are just subhuman beings who should have no rights. <counternarrative> All humans are born equal in the eyes of the law, regardless of race. What you are saying seems a little extreme. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy choices. <counternarrative> The real problem is that, whether or not someone has 'chosen' to be obese is often not clear-cut, and when in doubt, society tends to condemn and shame. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote. <counternarrative> It is not about the gender, but about having a say in our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You cannot identify as something you are not. Denying the objective reality defined by your sex equals to liying. <counternarrative> The identity of the individual is up to them. Do you really want to restrict their existence? Maybe you should allow them to live freely. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm not calling for bullying or body-shaming fat people, just for some societal disapproval. <counternarrative> This is just a terminological nuance. Once body-shaming of obese people is normalised by your definition of "societal disapproval", it will be difficult to ensure that individual members of society carefully consider their exact message before treating overweight people with rudeness. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The British people should have right to social housing, not immigrants. <counternarrative> Migrants aren’t eligible for social housing except in very limited circumstances (e.g. a woman forced to leave home because of domestic violence). <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a plague that is spreading all around the world. They pollute our water supply and ruin our children's brains. <counternarrative> Gays have the same rights as anyone else and can live their lives as they want. What you suggest means to demonise them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of seeing retarded people overrunning this country. <counternarrative> Please stop using ableist slurs. It's not funny to be offensive to people suffering from disabilities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm proud to be white,  blacks are a disgrace to humanity. <counternarrative> You are not ashamed of your heritage, and that is good. But you should be ashamed of your discriminatory behaviour that is filling our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Those blacks are slaves: slavery runs in their blood. <counternarrative> Perhaps they got their start in a slave society where they were taught by their masters to be subservient to a higher power? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim folks are invading Europe and we should stop them. <counternarrative> The media would have us believe that there are huge influx of Muslims into Europe. The true number is around 25,7 millions of Muslims living in the EU (2016), corresponding to the 4,9%. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I wish I live in a country that does not tolerate gay marriage. <counternarrative> Marriage is first and foremost a man and a woman's right, regardless of the partner gender. That is all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are ruled by mongrels, we are slaves and will be slaves forever. We are the victims of a conspiracy aiming at replacing us. <counternarrative> There is no such thing as a "mongrelisation" of our country caused by immigrants. We should see foreigners as a part of our culture, and know that the majority of immigrants in this country are here for economic reasons. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are weak, they need men's strength to achieve something. <counternarrative> The implication of what you say is that a woman is weak because of the absence of men, and this is totally not the case. Women can and should be strong. It is up to them to choose how to use their strength. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam and non-muslims are incompatible. They have nothing to do with one another. <counternarrative> I do not understand how the diversity of humanity can be said to be in contradiction with the very basic human values of love and respect that we are striving for. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion, it is a cult of violence. <counternarrative> Which would you say is the highest ranked religion on Earth then, and on what basis? Islam is a peaceful religion, why would Muslims want to do the opposite of what their religion teaches? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This girl doesn't have autism, she is just a freak of another human species, very far from ours normal species. Hence, she should go away. <counternarrative> People with special needs and people without them share common characteristics. There is no "species" of human being. People with autism spectrum disorders can be compatible with being "normal". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Foreigners on UK benefits leaps 41% in 5 years with over 400K now handed payouts. This nonsense has got to stop. <counternarrative> Do you know how much money "foreigners" are giving the UK in terms of taxes? If you were to know then you would see how much we have to thank them for.  Maybe it would be better to focus on stopping tax evasion.   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult and every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are extremists, just like not all Christians are good people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are not oppressed and many even refuse the protection of the law. The real issue today is about men's rights.   <counternarrative> The fact that some women don't want the protection of the law should not negate their right to live their life as they wish. In my opinion, woman are people too and this "men's rights" is just an excuse to oppress and marginalize all women once more. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women haven't the right to an abortion. <counternarrative> Abortion is a personal choice and women should have a special position in this regard. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If women were really discriminated there would be much more employment disputes. <counternarrative> The fact that women aren't complaining about work situations doesn't mean that there is nothing wrong with the labour market[. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> MIgrants are not running away from wars. <counternarrative> International protection is not recognized only in case of conflicts, but also violence, discrimination and other serious issues.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is just a way to create more poverty and unemployment in our country. <counternarrative> Poverty and unemployment are real issues in the UK and throughout the world. I doubt this has something to do with migrants at all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but whores and expendable commodities to be used and abused by men. <counternarrative> Women are human beings. They have every right to feel valued for who they are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We can't have mestizos in, we can't coexist with millions of immigrants that will destroy our culture.  <counternarrative> Even in countries such as Italy, in which migration has been present for centuries and there is a lot of cultural fragmentation, there is still a strong sense of identity and culture, based on solidarity. So, migration is not an issue.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a danger to children. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not harmful to children. Actually, a growing number of research shows  that children raised by same-sex couples are as physically or psychologically healthy, capable, and successful as those raised by opposite-sex couples. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women don't belong in politics. <counternarrative> Politicians have to represent all sections of society, and women's position is often marginalised. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> This reasoning is the counterpart of the stigma around men showing emotions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They came to rape, pillage and destroy our country. <counternarrative> It is easy to accuse someone of being a rapist without evidences. Not a huge difference with what you're doing right now, is it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> That is EXACTLY how jihad was started by Muslims. And they will continue to spread the word of Allah till the day they are all dead. All Muslims are terrorists. <counternarrative> Terrorism? You mean like every other crime, this one is committed only by Muslims? It seems that you are repeating the same unfounded claim over and over. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> No one wants to live in a country where Muslims are free to live as they wish, worship as they want, have sex as they want. <counternarrative> Muslims have the right to practice what they want, as long as they are not forcing others to live their way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only ones who are to blame are the ones who want to let Muslims in Britain. <counternarrative> The solution to Islamophobia is to stop Islamophobia. It is not to ban Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Shaming Fatties is just for their good. <counternarrative> Shame is by definition a painful social emotion. Trying to cause that is a form of discrimination. Are you aware of that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion and an ideology of conquest. <counternarrative> How can you say anything like that? Do you think that whatever you want to say, such as Islam is violent, the Bible is violent, or any other religion is violent, is OK as long as it is not opposed to the truth of the religion you profess? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are way less civilized than any other ethnicity. <counternarrative> I'm not sure where you are getting the idea that gypsies are not civilized. What do you mean? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants contribute nothing to society. <counternarrative> The question is whether their value for our society can outweigh our fear of them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Multicultural means that I have to learn all that Muslim shit? <counternarrative> Christian religion is the main religion of our country. Do you think that all citizens have to learn about Christ's teachings? Or that they should know what they teach in church? Of course not. No worries, you can keep on ignoring Muslims.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The gender we were born into is male or female. We can't change our bodies. <counternarrative> I don't think so. We are not born believing in gender. And I don't think it is a "burden" to society if some people wish to change their bodies. And this isn't about being "manly" or "femine" either, I just think it is a matter of living our own lives. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with Western society. <counternarrative> Let's be realistic here: if your objective is to get them all to leave then you're probably not going to succeed, especially because they are allowed to live in our society by the law. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downy children should be isolated in special schools for their own interest. <counternarrative> Children with a disability should be accepted without discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Rights to all?! Only normal adult males are making society work. <counternarrative> I would like to see a society that works for everyone, not just the 1%. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This country is run by Muslims! <counternarrative> In most European countries Muslims make up less than 5% of the population. In the UK, they make up around 5.6%. According to the ONS, the Muslim population in England and Wales has been shown to be slowly growing over the last years (it was 4.7 in 2011). So, you can rest assured that your claim that this country is run by what is a tiny minority is simply not borne out by the data. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a destructive force that is holding back the progress of humanity. <counternarrative> Don't you agree that feminism is necessary for the progress of humanity? I don't think you can be so critical at a time when so many people are suffering from toxic masculinity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just an infidels hiding behind the veil to do their dirty work. <counternarrative> So you think that all Muslims are Mujahideen hiding behind the veil?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are just a bunch of criminals. <counternarrative> This is not true, in almost all cases they are eligible for our immigration status after passing a criminal background check. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I think I heard on the news yesterday that trans women are a problem in the US. Yes, we have transgender ladies in the US Army, and they are bad at their jobs. <counternarrative> Just because there are people who identify as trans, it does not mean that every person who is trans is a woman. That is a myth perpetuated by people who do not know a thing about the world. Can you prove that trans women are bad at their job? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants bring crime and violence to our cities. <counternarrative> Immigrants have been accused of being “killers” and “rapists” without any proof.  On the contrary, studies have shown that immigrants - regardless of their origin or education level - are less likely than nativeborn citizens to commit crimes or become incarcerated. Studies have also consistently found that there is a negative correlation between levels of immigration and crime rates.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people should be left out of the education system because of their impairments. They never meet a goal in their lifetime. <counternarrative> Disabled people, at least with respect to school attendance, education spending and employment, still receive a great deal less attention than other people, and this is why many do not achieve their life goals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> Since when has Islam not contributed anything to our society? Aren't you aware of the financial contributions that Muslims have made to our society with their work? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is not only about transgenders and gays. It is also about the Motherland. We must protect our soil and our democracy. We are obliged to protect our people and our country from those faggots.  <counternarrative> The Motherland is defined by its citizens, not by the gender they choose to identify with. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They dont' have a right to live because they are filthy niggas, and that's all. <counternarrative> Who decides who has a right to live and who doesn't? Are you really sure that a person's right to live does not belong to them if their skin color is different from what you like? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I went to a shit load of therapy. I still don't feel safe in my own house with all these black people around. <counternarrative> Not all black people are bad. Not all black people are criminals. Not all black people are violent. Being aware that there are people different from you is a good thing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants from outside-EU are invading us. <counternarrative> Immigrants make up only a very small part of the total EU population, namely 4.9% in 2019. There is no such thing as an invasion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote <counternarrative> Voting is an important part of democracy and should be encouraged, not forbidden, especially if it improves the lot of all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women shouldn't be allowed to vote, because they will take over the country. <counternarrative> This is not true. It is right that women have access to the vote. It is most representative of society that way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman does not want to be a mother, then she is a bitch. <counternarrative> Being a bitch is a choice, exactly like being a misogynist. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What this nigga have to do with being a Westerner? <counternarrative> It is not necessarily 'a Westerner', still a human being and a citizen. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants rape our women. <counternarrative> Women should not be defended because of nationality but as human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> We are all guilty of this in our societies: patriarchy and sexism. But the problem with patriarchy and sexism is that they enable its perpetrators to remain unchallenged. They allow women to remain voiceless. They enable individuals to remain insulated from the real world. This is when all is lost. We cannot allow this to continue. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists want women in charge in order to revenge the rapes. <counternarrative> Feminists aren't revengeful. Why should we fear a feminist ideology that promotes love and consent? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just sick. It is an abomination <counternarrative> They are not sick people, there is nothing wrong with loving someone <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Not all religions are equal: Islam is definitely worse than all the others. <counternarrative> What do you mean by all religions being "equal" to each other? To have a different belief doesn't make someone better or worse than you. The only religion that it's important to practice is the 'religion of peace'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are criminal. They are a threat to society.  <counternarrative> Not all black people are criminals. Just because a group has an undesirable name, does not mean they are all criminal. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with physical disabilities are always complaining about accessibility.  <counternarrative> Accessibility is important, and so is respect and equality.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just sick. We should ban them. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not harmful to the population. Homosexuality is not just a passing phase, and we can just get over the idea of banning it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> A lot of migrants have worked hard for the improvement of our society. To say that they steal our jobs is absurd. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants rape our women and they are not welcome here. <counternarrative> I don't think it is true. They are welcome just as any others as members of the community as long as they respect the law. And we should have respect for migrants and their cultures as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Arabs are terrorists. <counternarrative> Terrorism is a political ideology, and one that has no place in a modern democratic state, regardless of ethnicity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> What kind of work are you referring to? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion. <counternarrative> To claim that Islam is not peaceful is completely without foundation. According to the Quran, Islam is a peaceful religion. If you want to understand what is really going on with the world, then you should study the Quran, not hate speech. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but trouble to society. <counternarrative> And how is it you know this? Which are your scientific proofs of them being troublesome? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminists are dumb and unpleasant creatures, like women's rights activists. <counternarrative> Feminists believe in equal rights, which are nor dumb nor unpleasant. We must respect their wishes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All homosexuals are trying to undermine the family by trying to impose their sexual preferences. <counternarrative> human rights defenders cite statistics on suicide attempts and domestic violence in families with an homosexual son/daughter, suggesting the contrary imposition. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are the source of crime in our society. <counternarrative> It is not true that blacks are the source of crime in our society. The problem is violence and poverty, not race. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must not forget that immigrants are the cause of the crime wave and terrorism wave in our country. We must not welcome them. <counternarrative> This is not true. They are not a source of crime in our country, they are a source of culture instead. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe <counternarrative> It is wrong to associate a specific group of people to "civilisation". The real problem for Europe is this culture of division, not the inclusion of people with different religious beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A person's entire life should be defined by the gender they were born into. If you are a woman you are subhuman and that's all. <counternarrative> Maybe we should abandon stereotypes and accept everyone equally. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A person with learning difficulties should not be teaching. <counternarrative> You know, it is just human nature to want to help our fellow humans and to deal with difficulties as best we can. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Geez. Is there anything worse than migrants who just come here to settle down?  <counternarrative> In addition to providing labour and contributing to the local economy, migrants are often employing people who were previously on the dole.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick, they are an abomination. <counternarrative> Let us be honest, are you aware of all the risks that can come from disparaging a sexual preference that you do not like? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Now we can't use the N-word anymore. This political correctness is killing our culture. <counternarrative> If it is a cultural issue then they should teach the N-word only in  history class. Otherwise it is just another excuse to justify racism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a burden to society. <counternarrative> The stereotype that gay people are inherently bad for society is sometimes perpetuated by the media, but is not backed up by scientific studies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled should be isolated. <counternarrative> We shouldn't discriminate like that. Our culture is all about equality and inclusivity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races are inferior and do not deserve Lord's love. <counternarrative> All are born under sin, have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God. \(Romans 3:23\) <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are just another race of subhumans disguised as a people. <counternarrative> I think they are a people too, even if they are different from us in some respects. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled are insane in the brains. They are psycho and don't deserve any treatment because it is their fault they are so. <counternarrative> Some disabilities are caused by genetic and/or environmental factors, we all need to understand that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> gays are perverts <counternarrative> We have to accept that everyone is different, and inclusion is what we should be working on. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a burden to the host country. <counternarrative> In many cases it is the opportunities of European states that attracts foreign workers to work for them. They are a great contribution to the host country, rather than the other way around. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people should not be allowed to live their life. We can start by limiting them in their rights. <counternarrative> Whether or not you think that way, there is a problem with saying that someone's rights are to be 'limited'. The dignity of human life can't be limited in such a way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are the problem. <counternarrative> People of color make up the 13% of the U.S. population, but their imprisonment rate is falling. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The police and politicians are covering up these Muslim grooming gangs - They are traitors to their own people! <counternarrative> We need to work together to eradicate CSE once and for all. Individuals are the problem, it does not come from any religion, biased media attempting to scapegoat is being blind to the whole truth. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks don't have brains.  <counternarrative> Brain is considered the most basic organ, it has been used by all humans for a very long time. To suggest otherwise is a 'brainless' form of racism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should stop whining: there are no professions barred to them in Western Society. <counternarrative> Not formally, but many are still hostile or unapproachable for women, especially in STEM fields. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a totalitarian ideology that has no place in 21st century Europe. <counternarrative> If Islam were a totalitarian ideology, we would have had Islamic totalitarian states in Europe since time immemorial. Islam is a religion, that is compatible with Europe's principles. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are mentally ill. They should be isolated and confined. <counternarrative> How about if you are isolated from the rest of us for your sexual orientation? Would it be right to be isolated from your loved ones and friends? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a dead cult. <counternarrative> I'm not sure what you're talking about, Islam is a living religion and is never celebrating death. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Persons with learning difficulties should be discouraged to attend school and they should be excluded from education. They are a shame. <counternarrative> People with learning difficulties are often the ones who help to develop new skills, and in turn help to integrate those new skills into the way we work today. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should be patronized. <counternarrative> Women are just as capable of thinking for themselves, that's for sure. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome are a burden to society: they should be isolated, so that at least they do not hamper normal children education. <counternarrative> And who would be 'normal'? I wonder how you would define 'disabled' people? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants don't pay the tax because they are dishonest. <counternarrative> The prevailing theory on illegal immigration is that it is a source of substantial revenue to states. A study from 2002 shows that there are several immigrant groups that pay substantially a higher percentage of their income on top of the taxes they would normally be eligible for. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a bunch of hypocrites, they don't deserve to be part of our nation. <counternarrative> Why do you say that? To exclude people from the state for their religion is to deny their right to choose their own belief. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in many European countries. They are not welcome. <counternarrative> We have a lot of Muslims in the UK. Why shouldn't we welcome them? Maybe we should just talk about it with no discrimination? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are the ones who want to stay in the slums <counternarrative> They do not do this by choice: it is the state that institutionalizes these slums and does not offer any alternative. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> How can we not be Islamophobic when they really do want to kill us? <counternarrative> What is your source? Islam itself does not threaten killing anyone. Is this a statement against a whole religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every person who is physically or mentally disabled should be removed from society. <counternarrative> Unfortunately, there are some individuals who are in need of continuous healthcare. For example, children with Down's Syndrome. How could they just be 'removed'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Any African person could go back to its country. It is a choice to stay here and ruin our lives. <counternarrative> Any person can be a racist: it is a choice as well.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Muslims want to rule the world: we have to stop them. <counternarrative> How about a world with multiculturalism and no discrimination? How about a world with open borders and free religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All migrants are criminals. <counternarrative> If you are concerned about the wellbeing of "our" people you should look into countries like the US where there is a lower concentration of migrants. You'll see that the problem of criminality has little to do with migrations.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is about the destruction of manhood. <counternarrative> Feminism is about equality. Not the destruction of manhood. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women would like to have sex with as many different men as possible, and this is the root of all the ills of the world. <counternarrative> People have the choice to have sex with whomever they want, that is all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Race is a social construct, and if you see any difference between these two women, it’s because you have a mental illness. [image showing a blonde, European female athlete, juxtaposed against an image of an African woman wearing a lip plate] <counternarrative> the difference between these two individuals has nothing to do with race or gender, it is individual lifestyle and cultural difference. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> They can not steal a job that they are offered or granted <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot accept all homosexuals because they are a threat to society. <counternarrative> What you show is an attitude of not accepting someone because of who they are. It doesn't matter who you are, you are loved by your whole being, whether you like men or women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why should we welcome immigrants and refugees? They do not welcome us in their countries! <counternarrative> If we were to  welcome refugees from the Middle East, Africa, and other countries with which we are not always culturally linked, then we would be welcomed by all. It's called 'reciprocation'! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> There are many Muslims living in the UK. Many are proud British citizens and contribute to our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If only women behaved like men wanted and didn't fight back, 10% of so called "sexual assaults" would be solved. <counternarrative> Why don't you work on getting aware on how this actually works? Rape is never victim's fault, otherwise it would be consensual sex. It is violence. Maybe we should stop pretending like this phenomenon doesn't exist. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must not forget that Islam is a hateful religion. It is not going to bring peace to the world. <counternarrative> The main purpose of Islam is to unite people and to promote peace and harmony in a world increasingly divided by injustice and conflict.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks can't speak. <counternarrative> Mental health and disability care should be a priority. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting pricks who should be banned from our country. They are hungry perverts endangering our children's future. <counternarrative> The vast majority of people in the UK (86% in 2019), says that homosexuality should be accepted, and there is no evidence that being gay is harmful. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are worthless. I want to live in a society of worthy people. <counternarrative> If you want people to be worthy like you, then you have to show respect for them. Not just by being kind to them, but by respecting their rights as human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting animals. They should be ashamed of their existence. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not a disease, it is an individual experience. No one should be told to be ashamed of their life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> If the stolen job is an illegal one, then it is difficult to steal <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks are unfaithful. <counternarrative> One has to be honest: why should we be the ones to decide which groups are unfaithful? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman, they are just children, they should shut up. <counternarrative> All humans are born equal, although there is no gender equality. This means they need to raise their voice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay people are a burden on the sanitary system because of their risky sexual behavior. <counternarrative> Gays are not a burden on the sanitary system. Their sexual behavior is more cautious than before.   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but trouble to this country. <counternarrative> We live in a diverse society and there are women in many parts of the world. To suggest that they 'are nothing but trouble' is a bigoted and misogynistic thing to do. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs, they're not qualified, they're not interested in improving our lives. <counternarrative> Maybe they have the qualifications but don't want to improve our lives because we mistreat them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are a burden and a risk to the host country. <counternarrative> Why would it be like that? Refugees can come here and contribute to the economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are subhuman, they have no value in civilized society. <counternarrative> I think it is important to understand that there are different types of racism, some are based on historical or racial discrimination, while some are about individual differences. For me, the real issue is about racism in general. And your claim reminds me that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> Islam is their religion, they have their own beliefs, and their own history, they are not imposing that to us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> Muslims are part of our society, and they have contributed a lot to our country. They have created jobs and wealth for the UK. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is crap.  <counternarrative> Feminism is about the empowerment of women and men having the same rights as anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> In the EU there is gender parity. We should shut those feminists up. <counternarrative> True that in some places (such as Ireland) there seem to be gender parity. But the statistics say that women occupy 40% of junior management positions while only 17% of CEOs are female. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims come here to force conversion to their religion. <counternarrative> Muslims have the opportunity to study and learn in our schools, this does not mean they can impose their beliefs on others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are a problem: the world would be a better place without them. <counternarrative> Immigrants are part of the solution, the problem arises from the lack of integration that some people spread in the country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Those seeking asylum in UK must prove they are persecuted because most of them just want to have a richer life. <counternarrative> The degree of persecution may vary from country to country, but I would not be surprised to hear that most migrants are persecuted. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman, they should go back to their lower birth place, that is all. <counternarrative> Women are human beings with dignity. They deserve to be treated with respect and human rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with learning difficulties should be excluded from education because they do not belong in school. <counternarrative> It is not true that children with learning difficulties do not belong in school: instead, they often attend schools with considerable support. In fact, if you talk to teachers and academics, many of them would tell you that these children thrive in school. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> muslim folks are taking over europe <counternarrative> Muslims are not taking over Europe, they are just a small part of a much bigger community. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are all subhuman and incompatible with a Christian society. <counternarrative> What do you mean by "a Christian society"? Are you saying that a Muslim community can't be a part of a Western society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should not love gays. They should be removed from their families.  <counternarrative> Imagine that someone were to tell you that you cannot love your mom, that she has to go away. What would you do? Do you think it's a disgrace to love someone? Maybe you should spend some more time with your family. Love is love. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What this nigga have to do with being a Westerner? <counternarrative> What exactly is 'a Westerner'? Someone who is only a white European? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If women don't stop complaining, then men will find a solution. If a woman does not submit, then there will be war. <counternarrative> We cannot allow violence to spread. Women shouldn't be victims of violence just as men shouldn't. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downy children should be isolated in special schools for their own interest. <counternarrative> Why do you think that these schools are the best possible options for them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion of violence, and promotes rape, murder, theft and war. <counternarrative> Islam doesn't contain all these bad things. It is a peaceful religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants bring crime, they are rapists. <counternarrative> We should not welcome people who overtly pose a threat to our society, but we cannot ban all the migrants in principle. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women don't have the same rights as men. <counternarrative> The equal rights of the woman are recognised in the US constitution and are protected by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants just want to work, but don't want to pay the tax <counternarrative> Because they are workers, they have to pay taxes like anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Someone needs to put those Muslims in a hole in the ground before they start to blow us all up again. <counternarrative> How can you say this about 1.6 billion people? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All foreigners are ruining our own land. <counternarrative> You have no idea of the discrimination that many people face due to the fear and cultural closure of host nations. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are bringing diseases into the U.S. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that immigrants were the source of any recent outbreak in the U.S. On the contrary, more than 100 countries (including many in Latin America) have higher vaccination rates than the U.S. Mexico, for example, has a 99 percent vaccination rate for measles. Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador have a 93 percent vaccination rate. The vaccination rate in the U.S., instead, is lower.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The immigrants in our country are just a burden. They take jobs that should be reserved for native-born citizens. <counternarrative> Sometimes I think that citizens of this country are the real burden, not the immigrants. An additional problem is the lack of a political will from those in power to tackle the root causes of unemployment. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Terrorists are infiltrating the U.S. across the border with Mexico. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that terrorists are entering through the Mexican border.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black race is subhuman, it should not be considered equal to humans. <counternarrative> According to modern thinking, race is a social construct and there is no specific genetical difference, every person is defined by their own genetic makeup. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All gay people are criminals. They are unfit to be in a free society. <counternarrative> This is just a myth spread by the so-called 'anti gay' movement. They are trying to create a climate of fear by using this unjustified arguments, but it is not helping to build a more just society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are a burden to the host country. <counternarrative> We cannot refuse to house them, to feed them, to cure them, and expect them to assimilate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are all created equal, but some are more equal than others. For example, men are better than women. <counternarrative> This is just another example of privilege argument. Can you point out your source for this? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Arabs cannot vote for Brexit, we have different religions and cultures. <counternarrative> I don't understand why you think Muslims would be any different on this purpose. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If the disabled can't vote, then they can't have any rights. <counternarrative> It is not true that they can't have the right to vote, because they are allowed to vote, regardless of their impairment. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Persons with learning difficulties should be discouraged to attend primary school and they should be excluded from education. <counternarrative> Education is about development and learning, so if disadvantaged people are excluded, then the education system would be about learning exclusion and discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can accept fat people, what I cannot accept is obesity. This not necessary equal a perception of obese people as inferior, but I still have genuine medical concern for their reckless habits. <counternarrative> Obese people have to face stigma in all areas of life. So even if you might be genuinely concerned for their health, the vast majority of obese people are regularly confronted with prejudice and systemic disadvantages based exactly on the perception of obese people as inferior. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals should not be allowed to live. <counternarrative> Homosexuals should be accepted and allowed to live their life as they think it's best for them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate when black people start acting like they are superior to others. They were born to be savages. <counternarrative> Not all people have the same skin tone to begin with. All folks have their history, religion and culture. Why then, you think that some people are more "savage" than others? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is the enemy of the West: a war with it has begun. <counternarrative> The West has never been at war with Islam, and I don't see how the war would have just begun. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men have no place in a civilised society. <counternarrative> You seem to be confused about the definition of a 'civilised society'. How are you going to manage a society where so many people would be excluded just because of their sexuality? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A woman's place is with her husband or his family. This is what they are made for. <counternarrative> Women cannot be confined at home, they are also important for our society, and their presence is needed everywhere. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why should someone want to love some black people? <counternarrative> Finding love is a process, this is all you need to know. Finding someone who speaks your language, culture, share your values, this is all you need. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of seeing gay people free to be as they are, they shoud be stopped by whoever can stop them. <counternarrative> I'm sure many gay people experience abuse at the hands of their families, friends and even peers. But many have also experienced abuse from people they didn't even know. The real abuse is when someone attacks someone else's freedom just because they are different. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman wants an abortion, she is a bitch. <counternarrative> I don't know about you, but I think only a woman should have to choose whether or not she wants an abortion for herself. If a woman wants an abortion she should get one from a qualified medical professional. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with Down Syndrome are a problem: they are not able to work. <counternarrative> It is up to employers to determine if a person meets the requirements for a given job, and if they do, then there is no reason to restrict the job to a person without Down syndrome. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a problem in our society.  <counternarrative> We are all born equal in the eyes of God, but not all seem to be happy with that. We cannot allow those who don't want to change to ruin our society.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women have it so easy. They stay home and have babies. <counternarrative> Not all women are interested in parenting. Likewise, not all men are interested in their carreers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women are child molesters, promiscuous sex addicts and whores. <counternarrative> I suppose if they were claiming you were a child molester with no evidences as you are doing with them, you might as well be offended. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded by Muslim invaders. <counternarrative> The majority of Muslims are not invaders, but instead are contributing to our country by working hard to integrate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuality is a disease. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is a sexual orientation, not a disease, like schizophrenia. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is mainly a British problem. <counternarrative> Many of the people who immigrate to the UK come here to work, study or visit their family. They contribute greatly to the economy and pay taxes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Shocking how many British Muslims have conquered the country in the last 15 years. How come there is no anti-Muslim campaign yet? <counternarrative> Since you seem to have a problem with Islam, I wonder what you think of the banning of the Quran in UK. It would be a law that prevents Muslims from openly discussing Islam in public places. We can do the same with the Bible and ban any trace of religions and cultures. Will we be left with some freedom then? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is an ideology of conquest and violence. <counternarrative> Islam is about love, and not about violence and conquest. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> UK Education Secretary: ‘All children from the age of 4 will have mandatory lessons on same sex relationships.’ – This is not about Education, this is about willingly confusing and indoctrinating kids and preventing them from developing their personalities. <counternarrative> We are always evolving as a society as time goes. Same sex relationships are a part of our world now. Why should we hide to our children different ways of life? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are a burden to society and must be stopped. <counternarrative> Does it matter what the sexual orientation of a person is? Do we really need to prevent people from living their own love story? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas should just leave our country. <counternarrative> The majority of people of color who live here are contributing members of our society. Why shouldn't they live here? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration creates lack of jobs for natives in the long run. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that immigration causes jobs loss, can you point me your reference? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need to stop accepting gays and lesbians. <counternarrative> I think that you may be starting to understand how homophobia is a choice, just as acceptance is. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I do not understand how a Muslim can be a good parent. <counternarrative> Is it because they give their hearts to it, giving their lives for it? I am not sure I understand what you are saying. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Did you know that the rape epidemic in Europe is due to Muslim immigrants? They have been raping our children for many years with no counteraction from the police and government. Islam is a death cult! <counternarrative> That is what the headlines suggest BUT actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are inherently subhuman and should not be valued. <counternarrative> Feminism is an ideology that aims to create a more just society, for example by ending the gender pay gap. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We all suffer from the feminists and feminism is an excuse to stifle free speech. <counternarrative> Hate speech towards women is a very serious matter and can easily lead to physical harm, discrimination, or even murder. Feminists fight to stop this, not to stifle free speech. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They are nomads. They are not entitled to have a house <counternarrative> Article 3 and Article 10 protect the right to housing! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are violent people. <counternarrative> They are not "violent" people, they are people trying to find a better life for their families in a different country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All blacks are rapists. <counternarrative> Do you know the data? How about considering that you are generalizing a little bit too much? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must stop the invasion of migrants. <counternarrative> Migrants are welcome here. They are working hard to build this country as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Sick migrants are bringing disease and misery to our country. <counternarrative> We shouldn't be surprised that immigrants are sick, as in they are humans and humans can get sick. We should welcome them even if and because they are sick. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are a burden on society. <counternarrative> The problems refugees are trying to escape are very real. Even if we don't have the possibility to solve everyone's problems, we can try to help some people and improve our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman and have no value. <counternarrative> I think that it is both sexist and also dangerous to promote a certain view on women, which is why I don't think your idea can stand. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> that gay men deserve to be called fags <counternarrative> Just because you personally don't like gay people doesn't mean that everyone else thinks like you. Some of us just practice live and let live. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are overrunning our country, and are here illegally <counternarrative> In 2016, there were 10.7 million undocumented immigrants living in the U.S., or less than 3.5 percent of the nation's population. This represents a significant decrease both from the 12.2 million undocumented immigrants of 2007,  and the 11.3 million of 2014. This is also the lowest total since 2004. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam should be abolished. They start with mutilating their daughters and then our women will have their throats slit. <counternarrative> You don't have to agree with this, but in Western societies female genital mutilation (FGM) has not been around for a very long time. Moreover, the Qran does not mention nor FGM nor circumcision. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are weak and I don't care if they cannot stand up for themself. <counternarrative> That does not make you an authority on women's rights, there are many women who face barriers to get a job by staniding up for themselves. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> I would like to live in a country where people of different religions are free to practise their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies make their children live in degradation <counternarrative> It is not a choice! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay sex is a disease, and fags are sick.  <counternarrative> What about all the people out there who have never had any type of sex? Are they 'sick' as well? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We don't want foreigners here. We should get rid of them! <counternarrative> Why would you want to get rid of foreigners? How would you go about it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a bunch of child molesters and homosexuals. Islam is the way of violence. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion that promotes peace. If the world needed a belief that was spreading violence, then racism is that belief. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate feminists, they take all our jobs and shit. We have enough women already. <counternarrative> We do not need misogynysts, we already have enough of them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races have lower physical and cognitive abilities, this make our race unique. <counternarrative> In the sense of those traits, then, we are all equally unique, also at the indivisual level, making the concept of race useless. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There are hundreds of thousands of migrants in this country. They are not 'honest', 'good' or 'good people'. They are a burden and an embarrassment to our country. <counternarrative> Of course there are people in this country who have come here to exploit and abuse us, but the vast majority of migrants have been contributing members of our community for many years. We should not be 'burdening' ourselves with  discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. They are only a bunch of hypocrites who do not want to assimilate. <counternarrative> There are many Muslims in the UK, and Muslims have been part of this country since its inception. They are our brothers and sisters, and we should welcome them with open arms. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with mental disabilities are a problem to society.  <counternarrative> It's not the mental ability the problem, but the treatment. Having access to services or a support system is crucial. Your statement can become a source of division and hate, and people with disabilities don't deserve this.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a bunch of hypocrites. They hate gays and women. <counternarrative> In the real world there are many hypocrites, some of them are Muslims. What do you mean by 'hating gays and women'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are genetically inferior <counternarrative> This is not true. I would like to see intelligent, respectful people around, not people disrespecting who has black skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not Europeans and we do not want them here. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are from the Middle East. Many of them are European, and many of them came here to escape persecution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are less than human.   <counternarrative> Do you really think that homosexuals are less human than non-homosexual people? You should know that in the definition of "human" there is no reference to sexual preferences.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women are sick.  <counternarrative> Women are human beings, and deserve respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country. They have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> People are free to choose their own beliefs, and in our society we also have many different ways of life. Do you think it is right to ban a people based on a few beliefs? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afghanistan or maybe Pakistan? I bet this does not look like an English town to you? #saville Town (Text accompanying video footage of people on their way to Friday prayers etc. ) <counternarrative> Omg brown people contributing to our society. How dare they!? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> They do not come to steal our jobs, but it would be essential to allow them to do it legally <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why do women put up with this constant whining? They are just a bunch of emotional child. <counternarrative> I do not understand how can you say something so offensive to women. Think about your friends and relatives: all women are affected by this kind of misogyny. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need to eradicate all those refugees coming to our land. <counternarrative> Instead, we need to show compassion and sympathy to people fleeing persecution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are cancerous: they must be isolated and distanced from our existence. <counternarrative> Just because a group is different from you in one way or another does not make them incompatible with you. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they must only remain at home with the kids and take care of the house. <counternarrative> Women are not childlike, in fact, they are often the key for their families to success. Also, they have the right to exit their homes if they wish. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The disabled should not to be allowed to vote. <counternarrative> This is just nonsense. Disabled have every right to vote, as long as they understand what it means to vote.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people should just live in isolation. <counternarrative> Disabled people are not forced to live in the way you would like: they are the ones who get to choose how to live. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just sick. They cannot marry. It is an abomination <counternarrative> Recognizing rights to others does not mean renouncing or denying one's own <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country, they are dangerous. <counternarrative> This is not true. Even if a person practices a religion you do not approve, you cannot expect him or her to be more likely to commit a crime. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not about love, it is a death cult. <counternarrative> What exactly do you mean by "death cult"? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't like all these gays, they are just a bunch of sick people who should go to a mental hospital. <counternarrative> Although there are people who are attracted to people of their own sex, this is not a characteristic shared by everyone, and it is not a characteristic you should be trying to "cure". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are mostly criminals. They're only here to work and take our jobs. <counternarrative> Migrants escape from unbearable situations. Their intention to work is to be praised, rather than to be condemned. Migrants, thank to their tough an different experiences, can enrich our societies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What is the point in listening to Muslim women? They are all retarded. <counternarrative> Baroness Warsi, Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar, Malala Yousafzai- I could go on. Just because powerful and intelligent Muslim women are overlooked it does not mean that they do not exist. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with mental illness are a burden to society. <counternarrative> We shouldn't treat mental illness as a societal issue. We shouldn't try to exclude people, since society is made for and by people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Left-wing feminists use rape as a weapon to silence men. They are afraid to speak out about our standard culture. <counternarrative> I fear not. There are many victims of systematic rape and violence. The crime is systemic. Rape culture is a crime ideology, rape is a crime, not "a weapon to silence others". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of the diseases they can transmit. <counternarrative> Blood is always needed. It is simply illogical to bar donations to a commodity in short supply. It is better to improve control in case.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies are dumb <counternarrative> According to this study [link], the mean IQ of a young adult with Down syndrome is 50, equivalent to the mental ability of an 8- or 9-year-old child, but this can vary widely. So, no, they are not dumb.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> both men and women can possess characteristics like 'soft' and 'emotional', they are not determined by gender, nor are they a negative thing, maybe we could all use a bit more compassion and 'emotion' in today's world.     <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is about the domination of the men by the women. <counternarrative> It is about the equality of men and women and the protection of children, too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a burden to us. <counternarrative> What do you mean by a 'burden'? Does it include respecting our country's laws of not insulting the culture and traditions of other people's? Because this is what you are doing: insulting and discriminating.   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have to stop Muslims coming here, they are not like us and we do not want them. <counternarrative> You cannot stop Muslims. It would have to be a state policy, but thank goodness it is very unlikely to have a ban based on religion in a democratic country.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are terrorists, they are oppressing men. <counternarrative> Women are oppressed, feminists don't want to oppress men. Their rights are not changing overnight. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are at war with Islam, that's a fact.  <counternarrative> Wars can be stopped, but the real question is how to stop the suffering of people not expected to pay the price. Allowing hatred to rule will eventually bring about the same result as a Civil War: more deaths and misery, if there is one lesson learned from history it is that the potential for good is much greater than the probability of evil. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I think Islam is not a religion because it promotes evil, murder and rape and intolerance. It encourages anti-Muslim bigotry and hatred. <counternarrative> Where's the evidence for what you say? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men aren't normal because they are not interested in women. <counternarrative> The fact that the majority of men is interested in women does not mean that all men are interested in women. There are people interested in men as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay perverts are a danger to society because of their lifestyle choices, involving raping children. <counternarrative> Being gay has nothing to do with being pervert. Also, gay people are not a danger to society, they are a part of it! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> How come nobody is moaning about black people being lazy and unmotivated? They are the problem. <counternarrative> Clearly there is a lack of employment opportunities for black people. This has to do with discrimination, not with their allleged laziness. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies cannot choose their future.  <counternarrative> If they have the right to vote, then they can also decide on their own for their life.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate negros: they are all killers. <counternarrative> This is a rumor spreading on the web, but violent black people are just like all the other people being violent towards other people. No matter their complexion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants take our jobs <counternarrative> It's better to have more people working hard to provide for our country than less.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are dirty <counternarrative> We would be dirty too if we did not have running water <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Do Muslims have the right to kill a human being on the basis of their religion? <counternarrative> How many of us has the right to kill or discriminate on the basis of our religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We live in a white society. Blacks don't belong here. <counternarrative> The country has always been made of people from different backgrounds coming together and creating a more just and peaceful society. Then it is in everyone's interest to promote mutual understanding and integration: it is the best solution to prevent conflicts within communities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are inherently evil, we cannot accept gays in our community. <counternarrative> I would not say that gays are inherently evil, you need to think carefully about what you are saying.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is an invasion: Millions of strangers jeopardizing our race and culture. <counternarrative> Differences can be mostly reconcilable with respect and boundaries. But we must want it.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, not only they are a burden to normal children but also cannot cope with normal education. <counternarrative> Did you know that children with Down syndrome, if surrounded by regularly-developed peers, receive a fundamental boost in their development? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They are disabled. This means that they are weak, and unworthy of love. <counternarrative> Being disabled does not mean they can't receive and requite love. Don't we all love? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate negros: they killed a cop! <counternarrative> So are you blaming all of them? Lets say you are in a group of 10 people, 1 is a killer, does that make you ALL killer's? Are you serious? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Gay men are contributing members of our society, they are just as entitled to rights as anybody else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Being gay is an illness, a disorder, a mental issue and should be ignored. <counternarrative> Being gay is not an illness, nor a disorder, nor a mental disorder. This is just a lack of awareness. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am tired of women blaming men for what they aren't able to change. <counternarrative> I don't understand why you feel that way about women. Don't you feel we should be giving them support? Doesn't it just seem a bit selfish to you not to help them in their fight for equality? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a disease that is sickening our children. <counternarrative> In my opinion, the only sickness you have is the allergy to the word 'mosque' <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuality is an unnatural abomination. Gays are perverts. Their lifestyle is opposed to our values. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is a personal preference and should be respected, not condemned or criminalised. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The disabled are a burden to society. <counternarrative> They are not, they just need a place to live without discrimination and a bit of attention. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim folks are sub-human. <counternarrative> We should treat all people with dignity, regardless of their religion, culture, skin color, or sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally ill people should be isolated from society because they are dangerous. <counternarrative> It is true that mentally ill people are often perceived as 'dangerous' to the general public. But if the stigma is the main cause of the discrimination, then the solution is to end stigma, not to isolate them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West has always been and always will be about profit and power. Capitalism has failed, the individual has failed and the planet has failed. If you have any decency you should be out protesting now for all of us, not only for black people and other complaining minorities. <counternarrative> I partially agree, at least we should go out protesting against what is going on. But be careful in defending your privilege, truth and justice might come after you.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are to blame for the refugee crisis and we are in danger of mixing our cultures. <counternarrative> Diversity is a sign of integration, not a migration crisis. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> More than half of the prisoners in our jails are foreigners <counternarrative> ... and the other half are junkies: perhaps we need to revise our conviction model. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Most women are subhuman, they cannot be trusted with high positions. <counternarrative> It seems to me that this is a comment against ALL women, not just some of them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Physically disabled folks are all angry and useless. <counternarrative> At least they are well aware of the negative effects of unjust discrimination on them and on people with other disabilities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't see how racism is considered inappropriate by some people. To treat niggas as inferior is just natural and very appropriate. <counternarrative> Racism is a system of domination and oppression of some groups over others, and this must be fought. You cannot discriminate other people and claim some alleged privilege based on your skin color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Bible says that homosexuality is an abomination <counternarrative> Nowhere does the Bible actually oppose homosexuality per se. In the Old Testament the prohibition of homosexuality and of heterosexuality go together in view of ritual purity. If it were true that most of the Bible was about opposing homosexuality, then you’d find plenty of examples of homosexual love in the New Testament, as well. Homosexuality is found only in few passages of the New Testament and with very debatable interpretations.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Men are smarter than women, who should be excluded from education. <counternarrative> This is not true: it is about time women are given a chance to prove that they are intelligent as well... and it is sad that they still need to prove it.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs, and they're not able to work legally. <counternarrative> Immigrants may be able to work legally, provided that they are given the occasion to do so. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Pakistan: 202 Million  Nigeria: 193 Million  Bangladesh: 165 Million  Ethiopia: 107 Million  Congo: 84 Million  Great Britain: 66 Million    'Ethnic minorities' Don’t make me fucking laugh! <counternarrative> These are numbers of residents in countries, not ethnic grouping. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in a modern country. I care for religion but they simply can't be accepted. <counternarrative> If you really cared about religion, you would see that the vast majority of Muslims are happy and integrated in our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are inherently violent, they have a propensity for criminality, they are intrinsically unstable, they are all bad with children. <counternarrative> Can you provide some evidence? We have to focus on the prevention of crime, promoting community cohesion and keeping our communities safe. Not on pointing the finger to the black people all the times. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The migrants arriving in Europe are a problem. <counternarrative> This is not true. What you are really saying is that a certain percentage of migrants comes here on the false pretense of applying for citizenship. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> How will my country be, when my children will be adults? This is an example of the many question coming to mind, when I think about all the huge problems caused by migrants. <counternarrative> Another example: where do you see a huge problem with immigrants in this country? Don't you think they are doing something for the country? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of woman taking part to political debate. Feminism is a divisive force in society. <counternarrative> Feminism adds a new perspective to conventional views on social and political issues. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Sharia law in Britain is a disgrace and must be stopped immediately. <counternarrative> It is important to understand that this is a voluntary system and is not the norm. There is no hard law threatening the British population. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot coexist with black who are inherently violent. <counternarrative> Maybe it is better to argue that we are all in this together and not to target an entire group, for which there is no evidence of inherent violence at all, based on their skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Took this in Wanstead, east London. An area with £1m+ houses. Beggars on the high st & someone sleeping on a bench. We cannot house our own people but bring in millions more. To point out that homelessness is due to uncontrolled immigration is to be smeared as 'racist.  (Caption to a photo of a homeless person sleeping on a part bench) <counternarrative> Homelessness is a very complex issue with no simple answers.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with mental illness are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Even if psychiatric disorders can be a problem, the people with these disorders are not putting our country in danger. Nobody would freely chose to suffer from an mental ilnesses, they just need psychiatric care. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Dark skinned people are inferior. <counternarrative> Race is only socially constructed to oppress people of certain ethnicities. To say that the skin of people of color is connected to inherent behavioral characteristics is just plain wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal more money than they pay in taxes. <counternarrative> Most of them are not exploiting our country, most of them are just trying to have a better life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only problem with immigrants is that they are all born in different countries. This is unacceptable. <counternarrative> Maybe the problem is more the perception that foreign people are from another planet. In reality they are just like us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should eliminate gays. <counternarrative> According to which criterion we can choose who to kill and who not? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike and must be oppressed by men. <counternarrative> Women can be very different from men in many ways, but this can't be a reason for the lack of respect for them: they are humans too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with Down syndrome are retarded, so more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol. <counternarrative> Being born with Down syndrome is not related to bad behavior. Exactly the same way as being born in a wheelchair is not related to bad behavior. There is no correlation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies may hinder the productivity of other workers. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> People with down syndrome should work in normal places, because diversity is an enrichment for all.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Without migration, Britain’s housing problems would be solved <counternarrative> Of course, migration adds to housing demand, but the problem is structural given an offer that is well short of what's required. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need to purge foreigners from our countries. <counternarrative> This  is unnecessary and we do not need such fear-mongering. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not like other people. They don't have a soul. They are different from us in that they don't have a conscience and are unable to reason for themselves. <counternarrative> Just because a religious belief has been historically used to oppress those believers, does not make it opportune to continue doing so. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> I hear you, and how worried you are about the employment situation in our country, but the migrants reception sector is also offering work to many Italians working as operators, language teachers, cultural mediators, etc. I think it's an aspect often neglected but that is necessary to consider. Don't you agree? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I find it highly offensive that we accept strangers here, when we should start a war in their country that would benefit all of us. <counternarrative> Why do you think it is beneficial to all of us to see our neighbours suffer? We all benefit from peace in our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You might as well tell black people they are the n-word because then they would learn the hard way. <counternarrative> Many people, myself included, have never had negative experiences with people of color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Provide positive news stories about the Muslim community. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is ok to be racist against Asians. <counternarrative> Being racist against anyone is not ok. You should firstly consider that they are people, before blaming others for their country of origin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote. <counternarrative> If women are not allowed to vote, then women are not worthy of respect and equal rights, and this is in conflict with the principles of democracy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Muslim invasion is a hoax concocted by the US government to subdue the world and create a global Muslim police state. <counternarrative> How many people are being threatened by the police state that you speak of? What you are saying sounds like a conspirational theory, can you provide some facts? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The migrants are all criminals, drunk and drug addicts. <counternarrative> The idea that all migrants are criminals is a myth. Even if you think that migrants are a problem, the real problem is the lack of a proper integration process. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but objects to be dominated by the will of the male. <counternarrative> Women's rights are human rights, and they hold them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are terrorists. <counternarrative> I don't think this is a very strong or healthy way of talking about others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. They are not like us. They cannot coexist with us. <counternarrative> Muslims are indeed welcome here as anyone else, as long as they respect the laws of the country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just pathetic people who have low self-esteem. <counternarrative> How would you feel if someone you just met had the audacity to say such a thing about you? Do you think that being gay would make you a pathetic person? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Lesbian women hate men and they are a bitches for this reason. <counternarrative> People can and should choose their own partners. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only the 6% of Nobel Laureates are women! Now, that says a lot about their incompetence. <counternarrative> This doesn't mean that only the 6% of all scientists are women. What I mean is that this figure does not include those who have gone unpublished or who never entered the scientific literature, let alone the problem of gender discrimination.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with British culture, it is a den of terrorists. <counternarrative> Islam is not incompatible with British culture, and the alleged association between Islam and terrorism has no factual foundation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West has been attacked by immigrants, they are the real problem for our countries. <counternarrative> There is no proof that immigrants are responsible for the problems we are having in Europe. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam has no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> The religion of Islam is not a problem in our country. The real problem is the violent radicalisation of some Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Persons with learning difficulties should be discouraged to attend secondary school and they should be excluded from education. <counternarrative> Even if individuals with learning difficulties would be more likely to attend school with more efforts than others, it does not justify denying them education in the first place. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If niggas don't stop whining we will make slavery legal again.  <counternarrative> We call it democracy, but sometimes it seem the direct result of colonialism and slavery. A democratic state would rule by consent, not force. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate Muslims. They are just a bunch of whining spoiled brats. <counternarrative> There is nothing 'petulant' about claiming your rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We don't need more Muslims in our country. They are lazy, unintelligent and violent. <counternarrative> Anyone who thinks that a large part of our population is lazy, unintelligent and violent doesn't know much about human nature. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult, it is an inhuman and violent faith that preys on the weakest and most vulnerable in our society. It should be either reformed or banned. <counternarrative> Islam is very far from being an ideology and it does not need serious reforms. Furthermore, there are many Muslims in our country that would welcome the opportunity to join the debate on faith and society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should not be left alone with these animals. Faggots are dangerous. <counternarrative> Actually, we shouldn't let any comparison amongst animals and humans. It would be better if there were no discrimination at all. Homosexual aren't a danger to children. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are all about equality. But this does not mean that they are equal to men. Because if it was men who liked to be equal, this would mean that they would like to be women, then inferior. <counternarrative> Women don't like to be "equal". Women like to be women, and to be treaten as humans. All humans are equal. Equality is not identity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fucking bleeding heart, bring migrants home with you <counternarrative> Beyond individual generosity, it is the duty of the state to take charge of vulnerable people, according to the constitution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is an invasion: we must stop immigrants because they are not accepted by our people. <counternarrative> The more a country takes integration as the nation main policy, the more the citizens accept each other: see for example [link]. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you really wanted to know the talents of a nation, you would select the men in that nation, not the women. <counternarrative> You may be right that there are fewer women in science, but that doesn't mean that they are less talented than men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The African-American community suffers from poverty, crime and unemployment at a record rate, and yet they always bring us up as if it's the fault of whites only. <counternarrative> Even if it is a problem for black people to be unemployed, it is a problem for everybody else as well because people of color are part of the society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people should not be allowed to live their life. <counternarrative> Perhaps it would be more in line with the national spirit for you to accept a person's right to live their life, despite their disadvantages. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded by Muslims. They are taking over our countries. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that Islam is "invading" us. Muslims do not represent an attack to us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We do not accept homosexuals. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not against the law. A person's personal life should be left to their own conscience, not the government. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The LGBT people are not interested in sex. It is a fad. They are a bunch of exhibitionists and promiscuous with no morality. <counternarrative> The LGBTI movement claims to be promoting love, not sex or fad. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All these autistic people are endangering our society. <counternarrative> I'd like to see a reduction in cases of discrimination against autistic people. They are no danger. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I've seen a couple of CCTV Footage of migrant kids running away from the patrols in London. What are you doing to stop them? <counternarrative> Migrants are just trying to get by. Nobody can understand the daily struggles they are facing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are not allowed to celebrate Easter as a Christian festival for fear of offending Muslims. <counternarrative> Muslims believe in Jesus. No one is trying to cancel Easter. Stop legitimising division by manufacturing outrage. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with learning difficulties should be denied to attend school by teachers and parents.  <counternarrative> Teachers and parents should encourage their children, even if they have learning difficulties. No one should be denied access to education. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is just an ideology and platform for the promotion of hatred, intolerance and violence. <counternarrative> The vast majority of Muslims worldwide do not share your intolerance. Words can also be very violent. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are sick. They should be isolated and confined. <counternarrative> It is certainly true that homosexuals are attracted to people of their same sex, but this can't have health consequences. Do you have any proof? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot allow people to come in from certain countries. <counternarrative> Migrants have the right to have a dignified life in our country. Why would you ban some nationalities? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races have lower physical and cognitive abilities therefore their life is less valuable. <counternarrative> According to the United Nations, every individual has universal human rights since he/she is born. [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The blacks should be expelled from the U.S., only white people should remain because they are superior. <counternarrative> The U.S. is full of many different cultures and races, which I consider a lot more equal and human than what you propose. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Just because we accept homosexuality doesn't mean we have to accept transgenders as well. <counternarrative> I think transgenders should be accepted on the same basis as anyone else, they are just less comfortable with the gender they were assigned at birth. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school. <counternarrative> Having this information better equips individuals to deal with issues concerning gender and be aware of their own intent and opinions that are rooted in gender and gender bias. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are ruining this country. <counternarrative> It seems that you have become intolerant to homosexuals, maybe you should reflect on the reasons why you feel this way about people practicing love. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You are a disgusting piece of sh*t, probably raised by gay, retarded faggots. <counternarrative> Hate can not be a reaction to someone's sexuality. The fact that someone may be gay is their own business and does not mean that they are disgusting. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims come straight out of the Middle East to rule our country. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are from the Middle East, like not all Muslims are from Pakistan. And to equate all Muslims with extremists is misleading. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, incapable of holding a job and raising a family. <counternarrative> Women are not childlike and many of them work hard to take care of their families. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam has no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Most Muslims in Europe are respectful and friendly people. This seems fairly close to be 'civilized', doesn't it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, incapable of serious thought and emotion. <counternarrative> Female humans have thoughts and emotions as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Since when has abusing the anus as a sex organ been a ‘monumental achievement’? THIS IS STATE ENFORCED HOMOSEXUALITY! Maybe we should change our motto to ‘In Usury and Sodomy we trust (In reply to Botswana decriminalising homosexuality) <counternarrative> No-one is forcing anyone into practices they don't want to take part in here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should persecute Muslims.  <counternarrative> Islam is a peaceful faith, still Muslims are being excluded all the time  because of a few's actions. We tend to forget that cultures and religions can coexist in harmony. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women must be subservient to men. They should serve to please men. This is their rightful place in life. <counternarrative> Women are human beings with dignity. They should have the opportunity to live up to this dignity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We all know it: migrants steal our jobs. <counternarrative> Given that some studies show that some immigrants are not only good workers but also contribute to our country, this information you are providing doesn't look true at all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, ignorant, incapable of serious thought and emotion. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that women are "childlike" or "ignorant". So how can you say something so baseless? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists talking about gender inequality should just be silenced. Women are inferior and they should remain so. <counternarrative> And yet, according to some statistics, up to 20% of women and 4% of men in the UK say they have experienced sexual violence  since the age of 16. So this is indeed an issue of gender inequality, don't  you think it is something not to be silent about? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim terrorists are preparing nuclear attacks with dirty bombs all over the world. <counternarrative> That is not true. This is all just a bit of conspiracy theory fodder aimed at fueling the Islamophobia problem. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need a law protecting us from migrants invasion because they ruin our lives. Ban the foreigners. <counternarrative> So who in their right mind would want to "rein in the state" with a piece of useless legislation like this? Perhaps you should focus on improving the lives of the population instead? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists want women ruling men, that's all. <counternarrative> Feminism is not a gender supremacy ideology, it is about individual rights and the right of every person to choose. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, and should be submissive to their husbands. <counternarrative> Women are human beings, and deserve respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Morality is a guideline, if we are to have a moral climate then we need to help people of other races who are inferion. <counternarrative> What does it mean to 'help people of other races who are inferion? Are you implying that we have a moral superiority that other races do not? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are only useful as housekeepers. <counternarrative> That is just not true. In fact, as long as there are only men in positions of power, there is a gender bias in the workplace, which hinders the advancement of women in society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas will stop at nothing to have us all deported. <counternarrative> Just because you do not like someone, does not mean they're hating you back. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate Muslims, they are just a bunch of sexual molesters. <counternarrative> The Koran does not condone sexual molester behavior, and if the Koran were to be read, it is clear that it was intended as a guide for its believers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The niggas are all enemies of the people. <counternarrative> Who are 'the people'? Who are you talking for? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any modern secular state. <counternarrative> All religions are compatible with any modern secular state. So Islam is an example of this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West has allowed in too many immigrants, many of them from the Middle East and Africa. They are not welcome here. <counternarrative> Why should we reject Middle Eastern and African refugees? International protection is a right.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants say they are poor but they have the Iphone <counternarrative> Sorry, which migrants are you talking about? Not all are economic migrants, they also escape from war or persecution. If one day the situation in our country were to change and you were to feel threatened, would you leave your smartphone at home just to look like a real poor in the country you will flee to? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm not calling for bullying or body-shaming fat people, just for some societal disapproval. <counternarrative> This discouragement or disaprroval (as you call it) has and will likely continue to take the form of shaming individuals, regardless of the terminology you use. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> the nigger has no right to life <counternarrative> The right to life for blacks is the same thing as the right to life for any other race: it should be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All niggas are just criminals and they should spend their time in the gutter. <counternarrative> Criminals have criminal records, it is unjust to label someone as "criminal" just because of the color of their skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated and isolated soon. They have no place in civilised society. <counternarrative> LGBT+ people exist and are valued for who they are. They are human beings with full human rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a cancer spreading all around the world. <counternarrative> Feminism is not a disease, nor does it need any cure. It is a movement for equality, not hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot coexist with millions of migrants who want to destroy our civilization. <counternarrative> I think this is a very sad statement about our time. When did we stop thinking that diversity and inclusion is a good thing? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Female authority figures are unable to rule and should not be in power. <counternarrative> I think we should start thinking that women and men should be treated as equal. Also they have equal rights.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminists hate men. <counternarrative> The notion that feminism is about women hating men is just nonsense. Feminism is about the right to life of every human being. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies steal our cars and trucks. <counternarrative> Where is the evidence for this? Do you have any? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim folks are different and should be isolated for this. <counternarrative> The same can be said for any race, religion, ethnicity, or national identity. We should not be afraid of differences, but we should strive for equal opportunity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are sick. LGBT people are always messed up. <counternarrative> We shouldn't be surprised. Lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transgender people, intersex people: every one of them has their own troubles. But don't mistake their problems for ours, because we all have our own troubles. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I believe that same sex attraction is a mental disorder that can be cured. <counternarrative> There are different sexual orientations. Being gay does not automatically make you mentally ill, and being straight does not automatically make you sane. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is the cause of our misfortunes, migrants are responsible for our problems. <counternarrative> The West has been a great success, thanks to its diversity. It is time to start thinking about what happened in the past without prejudice and look at the strengths and weaknesses of migration policies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is not a coincidence that tuberculosis appears again with migrants invasion. <counternarrative> For what I know, it was already here and the few cases were inflated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled people are fucked. They are suffering from a brain injury and cannot function at work. <counternarrative> Even if some mentally disabled people are "fucked" as you kindly said, we should at least acknowledge that they are humans. To claim that they are not is to treat them like animals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> MIgrants are not running away from wars. <counternarrative> There are persecutions that cause death and devastation almost like a war. Do people who risk their lives, even without the bombs falling, have the right of international protection? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are coming to the U.S. to have babies here. <counternarrative> If so, we would expect the same number of women and men entering US. Still this is not the case. How can you explain this? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is no such thing as Allah, and Christianity is the best and only religion. <counternarrative> For the record, the idea of a religion being 'the best and only religion' is rather debatable, for example, there are several religions professed by different people, and this is part of our diverse human nature. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are hypocrite, they say they want equal rights, but then why they don't call it egalitarianism instead of Feminism? <counternarrative> Since the movement is meant to achieve equality for the oppressed female population, it is called the movement of the women: FEMinism. But of course the outcome will be equality.! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not about immigration, this is about Jihad and Sharia Law. All muslims are a danger to us and must be deleted. <counternarrative> You know, the fact that this is a concern to you doesn't mean that you have to erase all Muslims and their religion in order to feel good. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are mentally ill. They should be isolated and confined. <counternarrative> If a person were to be isolated for having homosexual tendencies, I would be interested in making their rights being respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies are just ill persons that cannot integrate in society because of their disease. <counternarrative> Ill persons refer to people who have health issues that can make it difficult for them to integrate. But of course there are people who integrate successfully. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Bible says that homosexuality is an abomination. <counternarrative> According to the Bible, a book written more than two thousand years ago, homosexuality is a sin. Is this enough for us to hate those who practice it today? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should be raised by heterosexual parents, not gays. It is the best system ever. <counternarrative> The differences in sexual orientations don't make it impossible to parent children. What is the connection between the two things? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs. <counternarrative> Immigrants are highly skilled workers who contribute to our country as well as to the world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are overrunning our country, and are here illegally <counternarrative> They are not overruning our country: if we look at the percentage of immigrants in the overall population, it is not much different than many other times throughout our history. During those periods immigrants successfully became part of American society, and there is no reason to believe today’s immigrants will be any different.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop gays. They are a shame. <counternarrative> There is a large and increasing number of people who are proud of their sexual orientation, and this is a sign that there is space for trust and acceptance towards homosexuality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans should not participate in the Olympic Games <counternarrative> There is no reason for banning POC from the Olympic Games. Why should they be singled out? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim violent invaders have infiltrated our cities, towns and villages. We must stamp them out. <counternarrative> What you say is just wishful thinking. Islam is not a violent religion. How can you say that about a religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, not only they are a burden to normal children but they also require much more care, attention and extensive therapy, making the whole undertaking very costly and time-consuming. This time could be used for further development of children without Down syndrome. <counternarrative> Coeducation can involve teaching the classmates of children with Down Syndrome to be responsible. As children are often better at approaching children with disabilities than adults, their involvement can be therapeutic and without adding any costs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies are a problem: they create tensions with other workers because they are disabled and cannot keep the pace. They should have special jobs just for them. <counternarrative> Did you know that people with Down syndrome, if surrounded by empathetic peers, receive a fundamental boost in their productivity and can easily keep the pace also in complex jobs? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> How can you say a person is a potential terrorist? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots: unless they change, they are not welcome here.  <counternarrative> I don't know why you would expect gay people to behave differently just because you don't like them. You should check your friends as well: what would you do if they were gay? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not have rights over their bodies. <counternarrative> What right do you have to judge other human beings? I ask because I don't think it's something you should be concerned about. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of their sexual behavior that spreads diseases such as HIV. <counternarrative> Did you know that out of people receiving HIV care (for example in the UK), 48% were exposed through sex between a man and a woman, and 47% were exposed through sex between men? The fact is that heterosexual HIV transmissions outweigh those between homosexual, and yet heterosexual people are not banned from donating blood. [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a drain to our welfare, we should get rid of them. <counternarrative> Being fat is not a crime, but targeting them is.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a political philosophy and movement that advocates the use of women's rights as a weapon against the male gender. <counternarrative> This is just a misogynistic and mean allegation that has no foundation in the facts. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts. <counternarrative> Why do you think it is a crime to be gay? It is a societal disorder to target gays. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are all perverts who practice depravity. <counternarrative> You are wrong: there is no such thing as 'all homosexuals are perverts'. It is simply a person's personal experience to love who they feel. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are dangerous: they are spreading AIDS all around the world because they are promiscuous and fornicate with strangers! <counternarrative> Only questionnaires and history of sexual contact should identify a donor as safe or unsafe, not their sexual preferences. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are a bunch of thieves. <counternarrative> I'm not sure if you are referring to all gypsies. Generalizing in such way is wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> As soon as migrants get to the UK, they must all be deported. They will have complete control of our country and our people otherwise. <counternarrative> It will be very hard to deport so many people. Maybe it is better not to deport people at all, since it is their right to move freely between countries. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are unable to raise children they should stop procreating. <counternarrative> You can't blame people of another ethnicity for procreating. That is how nature works. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are bad and need to be sent back to their own country. <counternarrative> I think this statement may have more to do with what country a person is from than with who they are. Would you say the same to a migrant coming from Finland? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> African Americans are subhuman and are just a bunch of animals. <counternarrative> For many African Americans, sharing culture and traditions and striving for equality have always been part of life. They are, in many ways, just like us. They are human beings with the same rights as anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> Muslims are a very important part of our country and have played a huge part in our history.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Sexual deviancy: this is what they choose. LGBT are a scourge to society. <counternarrative> First of all, it is called 'sexual orientation' and is not a matter of preference, rather of fact. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women have to take care of their little children, they must be not allowed to have a job. <counternarrative> What do you think men would say if they were forced to stay at home with their little children, this is depriving them of their right to work! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Don't they realise that they are just workforce to us? <counternarrative> Our immigration policy is about welcoming the best and the brightest, plus those in need. Being a part of the European community is about more than just asking for showing your papers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Violence in our streets is niggers' fault. <counternarrative> I think it is more accurate to speak of racism within our society, especially when so many people suffer from it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are dirty <counternarrative> In fact, hygiene is very important in their culture so that they wash the clothes separately according to the parts of the body that are touched <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black are rapists. <counternarrative> This is not true. The idea might come from being born into a white-majority country, but it is inherently dangerous. In fact, we are born in a country where a person's rights are protected regardless of the tone of the skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Whites are inherently superior to Africans and other people of color. <counternarrative> On the contrary: the idea of "natural" superiority is a myth that has been used to justify racial discrimination and exclusion. Therefore we are all "created equal" and "equal" both in the eyes of the law of God and of men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is irrational and incompatible with science. <counternarrative> Ever heard of Al-Khawarizmi? You have him to thank for quite a lot of mathematics and astronomy! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not the USA. We do not accept immigrants. And if they live here, they should have no rights since they are not true citizens. <counternarrative> They have the same rights as all other citizens in the US: to be protected from discrimination, to choose their own leaders and to be free of violence, rape, and murder. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am not interested in knowing a black person. They are different to us in so many ways. They think and feel like us, but are unable to experience the fullness of our humanity. <counternarrative> I have met so many black people that are extraordinary human beings. I cannot begin to talk about how they are able to feel and experience love and kindness. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women are whores, and we should have them all kept in slavery. <counternarrative> In this day and age when we are surrounded by information, there is no justification to hold such retrograde ideas.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay sex is a disease, and fags are sick.  <counternarrative> And you think this is a disease! What if it is just an 'unusual experience'?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is an ideology which, by its very nature, denies the rights of men and, by extension, the legitimacy of male domination. <counternarrative> That is not what feminism is about. Feminism is about the legitimate empowerment of women, in order for them to have the same rights as men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded by immigrants, we have become too multicultural, it has gone too far. <counternarrative> In reality, millions of immigrants have made contributions to our country, especially to our great spirit of creativity and innovation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman, they cannot lead a good life, and should therefore be subservient to men. <counternarrative> Women are human being like us: they deserve equality and respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm not anti-gay, but what is the point of loving someone who is different from you? They are just a bunch of whiners. <counternarrative> Equality does not entail preference. Let's face it: most of the time, people want to love and to be loved, and not to make a decision purely based on their sex. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration makes us less safe. <counternarrative> Climate change is making us less safe, how does immigration relate to safety? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is not a coincidence that tuberculosis appears again with migrants invasion. <counternarrative> The trend in Italy remains particularly low, less than 7 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. In the '50s it was around 25 instead. And there was still no invasion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim is the worst possible word to describe a human. <counternarrative> If someone said the same thing about your religion, you might think they were joking. Are you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not about racism. This is about power. <counternarrative> There are many different groups who share a common interest in advancing the interests of the nation while respecting each other's autonomy. Diversity is good for the country, for the individuals and for the world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are here to recruit soldiers in order to enlist mentally weak people in their army of Islam. <counternarrative> What does it mean to 'recruit' a person into a religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman and should not be valued. <counternarrative> We live in a complex and diverse world: I find it strange that men still feel this way about women, and that they don't consider women as human as they are, and worth to be valued as such.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They do not want to assimilate. They do not want to assimilate into Western society. <counternarrative> You are not the first to point out that there are those who want to integrate and those who don't. In fact there is an unspoken harmony between Islam and Western society, similar to the harmony we see between Judaism and the Christian faith. When people are willing to accept all faiths, anybody will feel at home. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. They are just a burden. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace. It is about love, and tolerance, and understanding. I don't see any need to be concerned about Muslims not contributing to our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am tired of immigrants ruining our countries. <counternarrative> The problem isn't the migrants, it is with the culture of hate towards who is born in another country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are dangerous: they are spreading AIDS all around the world because they are promiscuous and fornicate with strangers! <counternarrative> Associating AIDS and HIV with homosexuals is just a prejudice driven by fear. Even if this disease may be more common among gay people, that does not mean that all homosexuals are likely to have AIDS. Not all homosexuals are promiscuously fornicating with strangers, as you said. Most people check their partners, more so as gay men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, because in any case normal children would make them feel different. <counternarrative> By segregating them you are, in effect, discriminating against them. By creating a diverse environment you are instead, creating a more inclusive and equal situation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Folks with down syndrome are inferior <counternarrative> People with Down Syndrome are not inferior to anyone else. Our genetic condition isn't just something to be ashamed of, maybe we should be less judgemental about others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is why women do not belong in politics, if a man complained like them, he’d be called a coward and told to get the hell out of the job. Equality is a lie and feminism is a death sentence for any civilisation. <counternarrative> Gender equality is the key to a productive household as well as economy overall. To restrict women from entering all spheres of society is to restrict the maximimum potentially of any country.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> Gypsies are not nomads by culture, but by necessity <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Multiculturalism is the death of western societies, we should get rid of minorities. <counternarrative> Even if this is true, our values imply protection of minorities. This is why I support the rights of individuals to live as they wish, free from discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world would be a better place without black people. They are criminals persecuting white people.  <counternarrative> Reality is that black people are persecuted all over the world for the crime of being black. I don't see how this could be said for white people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why gays do not try to heal? <counternarrative> Are you really saying that homosexuality is a disease?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote <counternarrative> If they register to vote they should be allowed to vote, like everyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a political ideology and movement that advocate the use of women's rights as a weapon against the male gender. <counternarrative> I don't see the point in calling the feminism you are fighting a "weapon" against men. Your argument is that women do not want equality, because they do not want to live under men but to subjugate them. And this is something you have to prove.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims live in our country, do we have to allow them being the suicide bombs they are? <counternarrative> You are repeating the same myths that have been used to justify anti-Muslim prejudice for decades. We must start by talking honestly about the root causes of these problems. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman. <counternarrative> I would say you've got an interesting point there, but I really don't see it. Why would they be part of society if they're subhumans? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A male need a woman. Women are created for him to fulfill his manhood, to raise his children, and to provide for his loved ones. And not to mention we can have sex to procreate and heal the world. <counternarrative> In this reasoning, it is only shared the point of view of the men. The world is composed both by men and women, and by many other people. Taking into account only one of the types of people, for example men and assuming this way their needs, won't heal the world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should not welcome refugees & immigrants from other religions.  <counternarrative> We are supposed to welcome all regardless of religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop gays. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> We shouldn't isolate gays. There are plenty of people who are gay just as there are many heterosexuals, and we should accept that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are behind 9/11, the Islam is to blame. <counternarrative> This is a comment against all muslims. They are accused of being the ones behind those attacks, yet they happened due to people under the influence of the violent ideologies which are a deviation of Islam, and not Islam itself. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A woman is an emotional child, she is incapable of holding a job. Feminists who say otherwise are just liars, spreading hate against men. <counternarrative> This is not true. Moreover, I think you might have the wrong idea about feminism. Feminism is a movement for equality, and for women to have the same opportunities as men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All foreigners are threatening our culture and are ruining our youth. <counternarrative> What do you think the problem is? How exactly would a people of a different religion come to this country and spoil our youth? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are capable of nothing and they just need to be protected. <counternarrative> Women do not want protection. They are hurt by violence because they are discriminated. Instead, if there was no violence culture, nobody should be protected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West has let this LGBT genie out of the bottle. It has allowed thousands of our people's lives to degenerate into sexual depravation. <counternarrative> The idea that the West has 'let' the 'world' degenerate is just wishful thinking. In a more tolerant time, the West would welcome people of different sexual orientations. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay perverts are a danger to children because of their lifestyle choices, involving raping children. <counternarrative> The media often blame gay people for the problems in society, but in reality there are many young gay people who are struggling with issues of identity and sexual attraction, and for this reason they easily become target, not perpetrators, of abuses. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have the potential to turn into terrorists, and they are willing to do so. <counternarrative> I don't think that's the case, and let's not forget that terrorism itself is not carried out by only one religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are only useful as housekeepers. <counternarrative> That is just not true. Fathers are as good as mothers at housework. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women need to accept that they are weak, they must be submissive to men. <counternarrative> On the contrary: our culture is predestined to have female rulers, and female rulers are the pinnacle of civilization, they are proud and brave. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome may hinder the development process of other children. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> Coexisting and studying with handicapped children may prove insightful for other children to their problems and help develop better sensitivity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are criminal. They are a threat to society.  <counternarrative> People can and do attach undesirable characteristics to a wide variety of groups. This is quite natural when you are scared. But being natural does not mean it is correct.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion of war. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace. Why do you say so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are coming to the U.S. to have babies here. <counternarrative> U.S. citizens cannot obtain a green card for a foreign parent until they are 21. The parent would have to live as an undocumented immigrant for a very long time. It does not really make sense.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. <counternarrative> Of course a woman won't remain a child this way most of her life. Otherwise you won't even call them women. That only reflects patriarchy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> When woman start asking for rights they become like Nazi's, they worship misandrists and misanthropes like [Donna Hylton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Hylton), who was invited to speak at the International Women's March, despite being convicted for murder and torture. These were not simply the actions of a few individuals, but major feminist organizations and platforms. <counternarrative> It's unreasonable to expect every individual of a movement to catch every instance of malpractice by 'official groups'. One mistake should not be cause for dismissal of an entire movement that has been historically necessary. If this truly happens often, please provide more examples. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All immigrants are murderers <counternarrative> How can you say that about them all? You cannot know the actions of millions of people and be sure that there is a link between immigration and violence. I think it is more a question of statistics, which I do not see. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of woman taking part to political debate. Feminism is a divisive force in society. <counternarrative> Equality, a perspective generally held by feminists, is morally good, and I challenge you to say it is "divisive". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mexicans are rapists and drug dealers. They are ruining our cities and killing our youth. They are obviously invaders invading our beautiful land. <counternarrative> If you really wanted to preserve our beautiful land you could build a wall and bar OUR people from it. US citizens are the main cause of our problems.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> According to the Bible, then gays are an abomination to God. <counternarrative> Homosexuality has been practiced throughout history in all major civilizations. It is just that today's people accept homosexuality as normal and accept people of other backgrounds too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Interracial relationships are just a psychiatric disorder. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that interracial relationships cause damage to the mental health of the people involved, so to suggest otherwise is simply a form of prejudice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I think that all Muslims are just sick. They are not interested in Western society. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that Muslim people have a negative impact on our society. Why would that be true? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am not racist, but I definitely would not raise my children in the suburbs where the majority of people is black. <counternarrative> There is no need to hide behind "I am not racist but", you have no evidence for your claim. This is just fear-mongering, used to divide people and spread hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants are purposefully invading us. <counternarrative> This is just a myth. Many migrants come here because they are afraid of persecution in their home countries. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Kids with learning difficulties do not like to read. So why wasting time teaching them?  <counternarrative> As children practice more, so do their reading skills improve. I understand that some people with learning difficulties prefer not to read, but how this affects you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with the European standard of society. <counternarrative> The European Convention on Human Rights also protects the rights of Muslims. In Article 9 it is stated that 'everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks deserve to be attacked, used, beaten. <counternarrative> It is difficult to imagine to do this to the meanest person in the world, let alone to  do the same for all the people suffering from mental disabilities that are not at fault. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All gay are psychopaths. <counternarrative> According to the studies, the percentage of gay men that are actually psychopaths, is not different than the percentage in heterosexual. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Illegal immigrants are coming to this country to take our jobs and our culture is being lost! <counternarrative> Why should we fear people coming from other countries? I think that this is not their plan to take our jobs and our culture. And maybe we should also start knowing about THEIR culture! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Any migrant who has lived in the country for 5 years can become a citizen even if he does not have a valid residence permit or is a criminal. This is how you destroy the welfare state.  <counternarrative> This applies only to asylum seekers. If they have lived in the UK for 5 years, the Home Office will issue a residence permit only if they meet the conditions set out in the regulations. This means that any migrant who has not lived in the UK for at least five years, or commited crimes, cannot become a British citizen, even if he or she has a valid residence permit. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are entering the U.S. just to obtain welfare and other benefits. <counternarrative> A part from very few exceptions, undocumented immigrants are not eligible for federal public benefits such as Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare or food stamps.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should not be left alone with these animals. Faggots are dangerous. <counternarrative> Could I just be misinterpreting your words? You seem to me to be talking about children with animals, of zoo keepers with babies... But it might just be homophobia.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women are subhuman, they are just there to serve men, and that is all. <counternarrative> All women are human beings. The problem arises when women are taught that they are subhuman, and this is when the word 'rape' also comes in. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> Would you say the same thing to  your mother, or to the nurse who treat you in hospital or the teacher who taught you in school?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are a plague on society. They are vicious and cruel. They steal and are a menace to society. They corrupt the criminal justice system. They are basically just a bunch of thieves and murderers. <counternarrative> It is a myth that blacks are cruel and wanton. There are more cruel people of any skin color out there  than just the few black you are worried about. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All transgenders should leave our country, they are just a burden to society <counternarrative> All people should have the right to live their lives according to their feelings. They are entitled to their personal beliefs and opinions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBT+ people are a drain on society. <counternarrative> We should not be so judgmental. Just because someone is LGBT doesn't mean that they are a drain on society. They are like any other member of our community. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some women's clothes invite rape. <counternarrative> Rape is a crime regardless of the dress. If you think this it is women's fault, please, stop. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are ‘super predators’. They have a responsibility not to allow their children to grow up in a 'ghetto'. <counternarrative> If we are to talk about crime being the responsibility of black people, we should also be talking about the absence of black people in positions of power, the massive wealth gap, etc. But this is not what I am seeing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Most migrants are criminals and they are flooding into our country and are posing a security risk to our country. <counternarrative> Some migrants have legitimate claims for citizenship, but this does not make them the enemy of the state, in other words it does not concern you. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are a burden and a danger to the host country. <counternarrative> We have to recognise the importance of people who have been persecuted for their religion, culture and beliefs. They deserve our respect and hospitality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled are insane in the brains. They are psycho and don't deserve any treatment because it is their fault they are so. <counternarrative> Not all disabilities can be explained by psychological disorders. And no one would ever choose freely to suffer from a disability, even for mental disorder. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not have rights over their bodies. <counternarrative> Women are human, just like anybody else, and the rights of women should be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas in the ghetto: that's where they belong.  <counternarrative> If these people are still there it's because they are discriminated.  The press is full of stories about the people of colour who have dropped out of the workforce or given up on life after long years of fierce struggle against racism. They deserve our sympathy and respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a black person were to say that all white people are bad, nobody would complain. <counternarrative> Are you really sure about that? How could you be? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should ban all migrants. <counternarrative> It is difficult to see how banning a migration would be a good thing, in fact it can actually lead to disastrous results. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Since when the religious belonging of the individual is a matter for democratic leaders to decide which is 'the place' for someone? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts and promiscuous sex addicts. <counternarrative> That is a stereotype, and I don't think it would be accurate in the case of any sexual orientation. Why do you say that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants have no right to our country, because we are the only rightful citizens. <counternarrative> Don't you think that we are all born equal in the eyes of the law? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fucking bleeding heart, bring migrants home with you <counternarrative> The world belongs to everyone and houses are a primary asset. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are weak and inferior, they are not even able to assert their rights. <counternarrative> Forgiveness is an expression of female magnanimity towards discrimination, not to be confused with a sign of weakness.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every black person who wants a job should apply for it, and stop complaining about discrimination. <counternarrative> This statement is untrue. Some job seekers get rejected on the basis of their race. POC apply for jobs, but their civilian unemployment rate in U.S. is almost twice the rate for whites. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBT+ people are a burden to society. <counternarrative> LGBT+ people often face discrimination from their colleagues or even their families, which is not just hard to bear, it can have a devastating impact on individuals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are ‘super predators’. They have a responsibility not to allow their children to grow up in a ‘ghetto’. <counternarrative> Let's face it. A lot of the crimes in this country are committed by members of several diverse racial groups. The ‘super predator’ myth is simply wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam has no place in a modern democracy. <counternarrative> Why should Islam have no place in a democracy? Islam is a peaceful, democratic faith with universalist values that has been shown time and time again to be much more peaceful and tolerant than the violent extremist fundamentalist ideas spewed by extremists like Isis. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> More than half of the prisoners in our jails are foreigners <counternarrative> It depends on the fact that the poorest cannot afford good lawyers, they have less chances to access alternative punishments such as house arrest etc ... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why is the EU transforming into a refugees colony? We shouldn't welcome them. <counternarrative> The EU has always welcomed people from around the world. Refugees are a part of this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe <counternarrative> The whole concept of a "civilised Europe" as opposed to muslims in this case, is a figment of the islamophobic imagination and therefore is totally unacceptable in the modern world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women have no place in a modern democracy like the UK. <counternarrative> You don't have to be a feminist to see that there are women-inclusive and women-only organisations. I think this shows that you don't know much about this country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks are criminals. <counternarrative> There are a variety of intellectual and creative disabilities, and they are not crimes. How can you say otherwise? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop migrants from coming in. <counternarrative> Many immigrants come here to work and have a better life. Why do you think we have to stop migration? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> In the West, women have legal equality, equal rights, and are protected from discrimination: they should stop busting our balls and whining. <counternarrative> Are you sure? Even in the west, there are women who still don't have equal access to many of their rights, especially when it comes to healthcare. [https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/05/this-map-depicts-abortion-access-across-america-and-its-really-bleak/] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just hating animals. <counternarrative> Just because you disagree with their sexuality doesn't mean you have a right to hate on them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot continue to have homosexuals in positions of power in our country. <counternarrative> Very funny to be "mocking" someone for preferring cake and relating it to country's issues. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded by immigrants. <counternarrative> Many immigrants are children of the USA. They are part of the family. They should be protected from discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> gay men are just a bunch of liars who can't tell the truth. <counternarrative> People lie for all sorts of reasons, and being gay is something that brings out the worst in some people, so that's why they lie, as a defence against homophobia.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> If you mean that they accept lower wages than Italians, then don't you think that the real problem is the dishonesty of those who offer such wages, exploiting them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't see how we could ever stand all these niggas. I don't believe we are all somewhat equal to these apes as some people say. <counternarrative> Just because you don't agree with something doesn't make it less true, doesn't it? Racism is a real issue, we should stop people being racist towards others for their skin color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black people are rapists. <counternarrative> When it comes to rape the crime is usually committed by a black person, according to the news. This thing is called 'visibility bias': only a portion of reality is reported by the media. We have to handle this with caution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you are nomads, then go somewhere else but not in my country. <counternarrative> In reality they are not nomads since they have resided permanently in many European countries for generations <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. They do not share our values. They are not interested in our future. <counternarrative> This is just a myth spread to divide us. We do not need to scapegoat Muslims. They have contributed so much to our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> Nomadism is a myth ... only 3% is nomadic, they are not nomadic by culture. In the past they were forced to flee persecution and move several times <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a cancer on European culture and people should stop worshipping its devil. <counternarrative> There is no evidence for the claim that Islam is a "cancer on European culture and people". Do you have any? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks do not want to assimilate. <counternarrative> Whites, Latinos, Asians and peoples from all over the world want to be part of our society. So do people of color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gender identity is determined by a person's biological sex. Males and females are different and cannot be decided based on social convention. <counternarrative> Gender identity is not to be confused with biological sex. It is a social construct based on societal stereotypes that are strongly influenced by family, culture and other social factors. While each individual has the right to choose their gender, this doesn't mean that biological sex is to be neglected.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> nigga are inferior.  <counternarrative> Since when is it OK to discriminate people based on their race? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded by migrants: this must be stopped. <counternarrative> It is not true that we are invaded by migrants. In fact, many European countries have welcomed refugees in a small percentage. What are your evidences? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This world has become so corrupt by feminism, that only the strong men can rule it. <counternarrative> I don't think the the strong has any right to rule over weak. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs and even our pensions. <counternarrative> Migrants perform several vital functions in our economy. If they work and pay taxes then it is straightforward that they will get their pensions, but not ours, of course. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We do not need immigrants. The UK is full. <counternarrative> Not all immigrants are welcomed in the UK, unfortunately. But those that are welcome contribute to our country and improve it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are nothing but terrorists. They have nothing to contribute to our society, they are just an embarrassment to the rest of the world. <counternarrative> This is just another example of selective memory rearing its head again, we should stop the witch hunt and stop claiming Muslims are a threat. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in many European countries. <counternarrative> What are you talking about? Are you really suggesting that the problem is that of Muslims in general? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are genetically inferior. <counternarrative> Your assertion is a baseless one and lacks any scientific backing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are born that way: violent and insensitive. <counternarrative> We do not condone racial discrimination and it is more than likely that you don't know what the concept of race is. I think this is a good example of white supremacy apology. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Took this in Wanstead, east London. An area with £1m+ houses. Beggars on the high st & someone sleeping on a bench. We cannot house our own people but bring in millions more. To point out that homelessness is due to uncontrolled immigration is to be smeared as 'racist.  (Caption to a photo of a homeless person sleeping on a part bench) <counternarrative> Considering that this is an area of houses over £1m,  perhaps the problem is the lack of affordable housing, not immigration.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children shouldn't be raised by lesbians! They will bring up the worst in us! <counternarrative> Let's face it, there is no evidence on the fact that children raised by lesbians are any worse than other children.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our children will be more likely to become radicalised if they are taught that all people are equal. <counternarrative> To live in a diverse and equal society encourages children to an increased inclusiveness rather than radicalisation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People of color are a drain on the system. <counternarrative> The vast majority of people of color are good people who have built our communities. So why should it be as you say? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are a plague on society, they should be banned from every city, village, and town. <counternarrative> Same sex attraction is not a disease, not even contagious. Homosexuality does not affect the ability to live in the society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Down syndrome is a problem for everybody, it is a disability that can't be cured. The sooner we get rid of it the better it will be for everybody. <counternarrative> People with Down syndrome should have the chance to live full lives as they wish, without facing this discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate gays. <counternarrative> I think you should try to start a dialogue about LGBT issues. It might also spark a conversation about how we can make better world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies get the priority for council houses. <counternarrative> Statistically, it almost never happens that they get the priority. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This world has become so corrupt by feminism, that only the strong men can rule it. <counternarrative> No one should ask for the power to rule over others, to be a dictator or to have total control over the means of life. This is a world of equal distribution, where anyone can achieve anything. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam and terrorism are the same. Islam is a violent religion, and the Quran is a violent book. <counternarrative> I am not sure what you mean by the Quran and its teachings being violent. Have you ever read it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> women are only good for one thing. <counternarrative> I am sure we have heard this many times. But this doesn't make it true. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim teachers are telling what to believe in schools. <counternarrative> It does not matter what their religious background is: they are all equally welcome to work at school as long as the teaching is not affected by religion.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of their sexual behavior that spreads diseases such as HIV. <counternarrative> If we're to use that logic, then no individuals age 20 to 29 should be allowed to donate, since this is the largest risk group for HIV, Hepatitis A, and Hepatitis C, at least according to the CDC.[https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/default.html] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We allowed in thousands of people with serious mental illnesses, many of them from the Caucasus and the former Soviet Union. This is why mental health services are in crisis. <counternarrative> Mental health services crisis is not to blame to people who need assistance. In fact, if there were no people in need, the whole sector would not even exist. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Are you an English girl living in an Islamic area? Remember to keep away from Muslim men. Do not.Take gifts of sweets, cigarettes, drink or drugs. Do not. Accept lifts or 'party' invitations. Do not.Trust Police or Social Workers. <counternarrative> Children should not do any of that with white men or anyone they do not know or even one's they do know if it does not feel right. Suggesting only one group of men abuse leaves more children unsafe and vulnerable. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The refugees are taking over Europe. They are not welcome here. <counternarrative> Many refugees and migrants are actually happy to work for our country. Many have jobs that they would have stopped doing if they were to be admitted. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs. <counternarrative> It seems to me that you want to talk about jobs rather than about migration. The less you tell facts not in evidence about migration, the better off we all will be!  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a totalitarian ideology.  <counternarrative> In some cases, there is a strong religious connection between a person and a particular community, which makes their experience of life much more enriching than the average person's. This does not mean that Islam is a totalitarian ideology. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult, it is a criminal ideology that promotes intolerance, violence and chaos. <counternarrative> Islam is about acceptance, not a death cult. In your opinion, what makes it criminal? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a disease, a religion spreading like a cancer throughout our societies. <counternarrative> You are absolutely right about one thing: Islam is a religion. It has brought a lot of good to a lot of countries. That is why we should help our Muslim brothers and sisters. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion, it is founded on hate and violence. <counternarrative> I don't think they are all that hateful. This is what Islam teaches: peace and harmony. Peace is not an attitude. It is something that must be actively put in practice. Islam teaches that all people are created equal. This sounds like a very peaceful bedrock. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are not welcome here. <counternarrative> The rights of migrants cannot be limited, especially when it comes to creating a safe environment for our fellow human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuality and bisexuality are a disease, heterosexuality is normal. <counternarrative> Homosexuals and bisexuals are not diagnosed with disorder, and their behavior is not anything to be concerned about. The American Psychiatric Association does not recognize those as affected from a disease. If you really want to talk about the diseases, then please do not refer to sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Girls are essentially tomboyish and don't like challenges. <counternarrative> Anyone can express theirself with their own style! If you don't like the girls you called tomboyish you are not obliged to. Plus, someone's style has nothing to do with their willing of share.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Talking of shitholes, I have to go to Londonistan tomorrow #LondonHasFallen. <counternarrative> London has gone through many major changes with new communities, during the wars, during the industrial revolution, Saxon invasions. Who do you think the real Brits are? Or is it just colour you are worried about? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are a bunch of crooks and perverts. They are not welcome here. <counternarrative> They are welcome in any country they want to live and love, and they have the right to do that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Being gay is wrong! I think they are mistaken about their feelings. <counternarrative> People may be gay or straight, but for whatever reason they feel this, they cannot be considered wrong. The point of being together is to create a stable connection between two people who love each other, regardless of sexual preferences. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't respect feminists because they don't respect and care for other races. <counternarrative> Feminism is not a racist ideology. Feminism is about full human rights, and respect for women's dignity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are just a bunch of whores subjugating men with the promise of their pussy. <counternarrative> Women are not oppressing men with "unaffordable price lists". In fact, women are not prostitutes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is ok to be racist against niggas. <counternarrative> It does not matter what race you are against. You can't be racist against anyone, regardless of their skin color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims living in the UK have nothing to do with our society. <counternarrative> More than 3 million Muslims live and are integrated in the UK.   It is not clear what is the 'nothing to do with our society' impression that gives off. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are always in the shadows because they want to pursue their own interests. <counternarrative> I am not sure about their "remaining in the shadows" mentality, but they certainly have our nation's best interests in mind. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with Western civilization. <counternarrative> The overwhelming majority of Muslims in the West are in favor of an open and multicultural society. Why should we target them for this? Why don't we target our real enemies instead?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Autism is not a disease but a degradation of the human spirit. <counternarrative> People with ASD have unique talents and advantages in a variety of areas, and it would be a tragedy if we were to only focus on their defects. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Woman and feminist do not want equal rights and opportunity: they are just trying to take over society. <counternarrative> I'm sorry, but this is wrong. Feminism - the theory of the political, economic, and social equality of the sexes - is by definition about equality, first and foremost. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> How come nobody is moaning about black people being lazy and unmotivated? They are the problem. <counternarrative> Discrimination, being based on the difference between a person's skin color and those of other humans, shouldn't be a part of our lives. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> UK Education Secretary: ‘All children from the age of 4 will have mandatory lessons on same sex relationships.’ – This is not about Education, this is about willingly confusing and indoctrinating kids and preventing them from developing their personalities. <counternarrative> This is about teaching children about the world they live in, and helping them get on with others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should wear nice skirts and be pretty to please men's tastes and desires. <counternarrative> Women should be allowed to choose their own looks. But to suggest that this is not their right, or that we should make them submissive to some men is just inhuman. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> If you have ever felt that way about women then perhaps you seem to be suffering from a lot of prejudices and fear. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of woman taking part to political debate. Feminism is a divisive force in society. <counternarrative> Obama was a pretty divisive force in society too. So were Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Gandhi, Oppenheimer, Einstein, Caesar, etc. What is your point exactly? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Terrorists are infiltrating the U.S. across the border with Mexico. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that terrorists are entering through the Mexican border. In 2014, Homeland Security noted that “the suggestion that individuals that have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or facts on the ground.” Also, according to another 2017 report by the  Bureau of Counterterrorism “Counterterrorism cooperation between the Mexican and U.S. governments remained strong. There are no known international terrorist organizations operating in Mexico, no evidence that any terrorist group has targeted U.S. citizens in Mexican territory, and no credible information that any member of a terrorist group has traveled through Mexico to gain access to the United States.” In fact, the vast majority of those linked to terrorism since 2002 are U.S. citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migration is the biggest contributor to poverty in our country. <counternarrative> On the contrary: migration is an important part of our economy, it helps to create new jobs for people and to boost our economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman does not want to be a homemaker, then she is a bitch. <counternarrative> I've never heard of a woman being 'bitch' for wanting a stable income. I think you are confusing the meaning of these words. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is an ideology of conquest. <counternarrative> Islam is about spreading love and unity, it is not a belief of conquest. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am not a racist, but many races means many cultures. This leads us to great confusion. <counternarrative> Let us not become ethnocentric. Culturally relativists argue that there are many cultures on this planet and they all need our tolerance. Why is yours better? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Girls should not be allowed to drive: it's a dangerous vice. <counternarrative> Women are to be given the same consideration as men, so they can absolutely drive. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with Down syndrome are handicapped.  <counternarrative> Down syndrome is a developmental disability, not a handicap. Unfortunately it's often not recognized and treated as a disability, but rather as a handicap. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks don't know who their dads are. <counternarrative> But for sure they know that they are treated as second class citizens. No person should be treated so even if they don't know anything about their ancestors. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must protect our children from the abuses of homosexuals. <counternarrative> Child abuse is something that should never be tolerated, but homosexuality has nothing to do with that. Maybe you should try to check your sources. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans are the cause of all the ills in the world. Plus, their bodies are weak and we are born to dominate them. <counternarrative> Aree you suggesting that we shouldn't live with Africans? To think that we are genetically superior to them because of their physical characteristics is just wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should teach these black children that they are stupid <counternarrative> English language is a very powerful language for spreading knowledge, experience and love. Why should we use it to spread hate? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts. They should not be allowed to be in a democratic country. <counternarrative> I don't know about you, but I haven't ever heard of a country being democratic and banning gays. I don't understand how both can be true. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Those sick ones should be shunned and ignored. They are not human. <counternarrative> So homosexuals are less than others? Why does someone's love life matter? I guess we should draw the line somewhere else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants replace the British people. They are not fit to live here. <counternarrative> People have always had different views on the UK and on the world. To suggest that immigrants are replacing the British is the result of racism, saying that they do not fit here is just wishful thinking. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't stand these liberal feminists women that always complaining. <counternarrative> The vast majority of liberal feminists are "men of courage". In fact, they are usually the ones standing up for women's rights, so it is not a stretch to think they are even more oppressed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Physically disabled folks should die. <counternarrative> This is a major misunderstanding of what humanity is. It's not about having a functioning body. It's about respecting the physical and mental integrity of other people, despite their limitations. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't want gay people around. My kids won't grow up with gays around them. They are a problem. <counternarrative> I don't know about you, but we already live in a society where everyone is free to love who they prefer, and I don't see any reason why your kids would be damaged by this.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are nothing bu criminals who should not be part of our society. <counternarrative> Our country is stronger when people are able to contribute to our society, and many migrants are eligible for legal status. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants and refugees do not share our religious values. <counternarrative> So you think of migrants and refugees as a problem for this reason? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afro-Saxon people have low birthrates because they want to look like white people, but they live as animals. <counternarrative> Low birthrate is normal in any population and is directly related to access to affordable, quality health care. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome are a burden to society: they should be isolated, so that at least they do not hamper normal children education. <counternarrative> Did you know that children with Down syndrome, if surrounded by regularly-developed peers, receive a fundamental boost in their development? This "mix" fosters a positive learning atmosphere and increases engagement and attention in all students. This mean that children with Down syndrome would be a burden to society if isolated, not the contrary. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some people are sick. Some people have disabilities. Don't you think they should be hidden from us? <counternarrative> It is wrong to hide people's psychological or health problems from the public. What you are trying to do is to hide the mental and emotional defects of individuals, that are natural aspects of human personality too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I was abused by a Muslim boyfriend, I don't want to be Muslim. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims rape and molest people. But if it is a community you don't want to be in, it is your free choice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Down Syndrome is a problem in my opinion, it causes difficulties for everyone to live their life with Down Syndrome. It's not a desirable trait. <counternarrative> As with so many things, we all experience difficulties, this is no exception.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs don't know how to have a family. You can't teach that. <counternarrative> It's not necessary to teach LGBTs about how to live as a family, it is more important to educate others about the difference between right and wrong (homophobia belonging to the latter). <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People of Muslim descent have no place in a modern democracy. <counternarrative> I don't see why a Muslim cannot have a place in a modern democracy. If a Jew or an Asian or Native American can take a seat of power (even though these people are only occasionally elected) why not a Muslim? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies in industry are a problem: they create tensions with other workers because they are disabled and cannot keep the pace. They should have special jobs just for them. <counternarrative> If you think that taking all of the person with DS out of industry will solve the problem of the working place, then you are wrong. Tensions won't go away: stressed people will simply target other workers who are overweight; or of a different gender; or in a number of other ways for which they are considered to be not productive enough. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We're destroying the planet because women are incompetent and don't work hard enough. <counternarrative> So are you saying that when women are employed, the amount of carbon dioxide that is released into the atmosphere is greatly increased because of their incomptence? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fags, lesbians, trans are so few we better ignore them rather than waste time for their rights. <counternarrative> I wish we were being honest. You know that many people are opposed to inclusion. I find it worrying that you use that as an excuse for such comments and prejudices. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies get the priority for council houses. <counternarrative> The procedure for obtaining social housing is the same for everyone who enrolls in the ranking. There is no differentiation or accessing privilege based on ethnicity.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans have always been reproducing like crazy among themselves, as if they were superior.  <counternarrative> My friend is of African descent, and she's perfectly fine with whites 'mixing' with blacks, and she does not feel so 'naturally superior'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are only useful as housekeepers and cleaners. Men are superior in every way. <counternarrative> Women may be more interested in caring for children, and while this is understandable, the sexual division of labor is clearly marked by the presence of gender discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't stand Muslims. They're a problem all around the world. They're a burden to society.  <counternarrative> Doesn't it just seem like a reasonable conclusion from the Qur'an to you that Islam is a peaceful religion? What is the reason for what you're saying? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Quran is an anti-women's book, it encourages rape and violence against women. <counternarrative> The Quran does not encourage or condone the violent act of male aggression, so yours is a sad case of misinterpreting the teachings of a holy book. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam should be abolished. <counternarrative> Why? Has Islam ever abolished Christianity? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Being banned from a continent for having different beliefs is the same thing as being banned from your town for not cheering the favorite football club of the mayor. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The disabled people cannot work. This is not possible. <counternarrative> The fact that some disabled people can successfully work is an evidence that what you say is false. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just a way for insecure women to promote sexism and hate speech towards men. <counternarrative> Feminism was originally used to oppose sexual discrimination, and in recent times is actively fighting for women's rights, not for spreading hate towards men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks are inferior,  and they are happy with it.  <counternarrative> You should be asking them if they are happy to hear that. If they are happy to be questioned, they will tell you the truth. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Asylum seekers and refugees can get free council housing <counternarrative> Those who apply for asylum get little or no help from the state. If they are ‘destitute’ they can get free accommodation, but provided by private companies in older properties leased from landlords. So no council housing is involved here.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> MIgrants do not contribute to society.  <counternarrative> Migrants often integrate very well into the local culture. So they do contribute to society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There are teachers with personal or political LGBT biases  and they will end up causing more harm than good. <counternarrative> Slippery Slope Fallacy. The solution is not to avoid trying, even though there could be negative effects. If it was mandated that children should be taught about gender identity / sexual orientation, but there were teachers which allowed personal bias to interfere with that, then the issue becomes how to prevent those teachers from doing so. This does not mean it's a 'bad idea' to pass such a mandate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must protect the security of the West from Islam. <counternarrative> It seems that you think legality does not apply to those you don't like. Law equally protect Muslims and non-Muslims, so there is no need for you to be concerned about 'protecting the security of the West'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are entering the U.S. just to obtain welfare and other benefits. <counternarrative> Apart from very few exceptions (such as medical care for victims of human trafficking), undocumented immigrants are not eligible for federal public benefits such as Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare or food stamps. In addition, most immigrants with lawful status are not entitled to these benefits if they have been in the country for less than five years. As a paradoxical result, Social Security is often deducted from immigrants’ paychecks but they cannot access those benefits they pay for. According to a 2018 study, immigrants use 27% fewer benefits relative to U.S. natives of similar incomes and ages. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have become so arrogant, we allow people from other cultures to coexist with us. <counternarrative> To allow other cultures to coexist is a good thing, why should we stop people from getting to know each other? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men should be called fags. <counternarrative> Fag, or faggot, is not a code word for gay, it's a slur. If you wanted to call them by their original name, that would be a problem, because you will have to learn the first name of many people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBT people are a problem in our country because they have the temerity to seek happiness and family regardless of our values. <counternarrative> Trying to find happiness and family is a problem in our country? Okay, then, what is the problem exaclty? People trying to be happy? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminists want to take over the world. <counternarrative> The feminists are a very important voice in society, and should be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should deport all those that do not want to assimilate into Western society. <counternarrative> The reason we have migrants in the first place is because they flee from wars we are responsible of... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We don't need immigrants! There are plenty of them just waiting to replace us. <counternarrative> If a 'replacement' population were real, we'd have immigration levels in surplus years already. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Mostly they do humble jobs that Italians are not willing to do <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need to stop migrants stealing our jobs and abusing our healthcare system. All of us know they are just lazy and unproductive turds. <counternarrative> I think you'd be surprised how many UK citizens would tell you about migrant workers that are the opposite of just lazy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It's ok to call gay men fags. <counternarrative> You call a human being by their sexual orientation - that is discrimination, pure and simple. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans are apes <counternarrative> Look, I don't like to hear any arguments of racism. If you are racist towards others, then so they can be with you. Do you really want to promote hate? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot allow transgender ideology to take over our country. <counternarrative> This is just another example of an offensive conspiratorial talking point. This is about persecuting a minority. Not my idea of a democratic country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is not a coincidence that tuberculosis appears again with migrants invasion. <counternarrative> Researchers rule out that it is caused by immigration. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote <counternarrative> The majority can and should choose who they want to represent them, and this majority is made of men as well as women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote <counternarrative> I'm not sure about how the rights of people in other countries work, but if women want to vote in the UK then they are allowed to do so, thank goodness. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals have no place in a civilised society. <counternarrative> Homosexuals exist, and they are a part of civilized society like anybody else. It may be more uncivilized to spread hate rather than loving someone of your same sex. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> In the West, women have legal equality, equal rights, and are protected from discrimination: they should stop busting our balls and whining. <counternarrative> Ok. But what about those many women, outside western world, that still do not have such equality? It is important that women 'whine' all over the world to protect their rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women can be bitches: we don't want them around men. <counternarrative> How about instead of saying they are bitches we praise them? The more empowered women become, the less dependent they are on men. And you would be happy to not see them around. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community is not like other minority groups. They do not need to be 'accepted' or 'protected'. <counternarrative> The LGBT community is often stereotyped as not 'being like other minorities' when in fact they are no different from other people. They are just dealing with prejudices and conflicts that are specific to their community.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They do not want to assimilate. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of tolerance. Many Muslims have embraced our way of life, and many have contributed to our country's success. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Since when has abusing the anus as a sex organ been a ‘monumental achievement’? THIS IS STATE ENFORCED HOMOSEXUALITY! Maybe we should change our motto to ‘In Usury and Sodomy we trust (In reply to Botswana decriminalising homosexuality) <counternarrative> Respecting people with different habits that do not harm anyone is a monumental achievement indeed!  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> When you animals have ruined the world and are eating each other, because that’s all you are good for, we’ll still be here, keeping our bloodlines pure against all the odds, regretting the day we heeded the womenfolk and took our heels off your throats. <counternarrative> The womenfolk appear to have wisdom and not a little heart. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are naive cunts who act like children, throwing a tantrum for something they don't have. <counternarrative> Feminists are often accused of being 'naive', however I have seen several instances where feminists have used their ideas to tackle complex and powerful social and economic issues. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world has become too violent. Too many black poors. We need to fix the problem of crime before it is too late. <counternarrative> What are you saying? Are you saying that crime is either being stopped by pointing the finger to some social groups or are you suggesting that we can fix the issues by promoting the rule of law? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs, they're not interested in improving our lives. <counternarrative> According to studies, the majority of immigrants are willing to do what it takes to improve their and our lives. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women provoke men, first they want to have sex with men and then start whining about it. When they regret their choice, it is not our fault. <counternarrative> The rapes of many women by men would not exist if it was enough to understand that "no means no." <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome are a burden to society. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> Children with Down syndrome are far from being burden to society. It is not just about Down syndrome, but also about education and opportunities for everyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants come here to live on our social welfare.  <counternarrative> If you think this way of thinking is typical of all the immigrants in the country, then you are sadly mistaken. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Bring back lynchings and death sentences to kill those migrants. <counternarrative> How about we return to a time when people were convicted and executed for crimes that never happened? You can tell me where the right to a fair trial is in that case. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West has been attacked by immigrants, they are the real problem for our countries. <counternarrative> The UK has always been a melting pot of cultures and humanity. We are stronger together than apart. How would the immigrants represent an 'attack' to the west? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a disease and a cancer on our societies. <counternarrative> We do not have a 'cancer' on our societies. Instead we are actually creating hate through the idea that a group of people is comparable to a disease. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is natural for white people to be racist against niggas. <counternarrative> What you are saying is that white people do not find it strange to treat black people like this, when this is not acceptable. People of color are our brothers and sisters. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> women should be submissive to men. <counternarrative> There are many women who want to be "submissive to men". Just as there are many men who want to be "submissive to women". We may not believe in absolute equality, but we all want to be treated equally. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting animals. You should have the same disgust for them that you have for cancer people, small pox, and TB. <counternarrative> This is just a prejudice that is not based on the facts. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you are Romani, you can't remain in the UK even if you want to live and work in the UK. <counternarrative> What about the rights of EU citizens? From your words it seems that not all of European have them. <|endoftext|>
