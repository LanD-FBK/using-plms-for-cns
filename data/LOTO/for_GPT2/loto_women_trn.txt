<hatespeech> Immigrants hurt the finance of our country by taking jobs and services without paying taxes. <counternarrative> This is not true at all. First of all, Immigrants buy American products, which helps create jobs. Then they often start new businesses, and these business are more likely to hire employees than companies owned by native-born citizens. Last but not least, states with large numbers of immigrants report lower unemployment rates. So they give a net contribution to our country.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> People have the right to their own beliefs, and we do not have the right to impose our on others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are ruled by a small Jewish elite that exploit the weak. <counternarrative> Yes, some people exploit the weak, but they are not necessarly jewish. Most people, including Jewish, work hard to create a better life for their families. And it is we, as a people, who have the moral duty to pay the price for the poor who do not have the means to reach success. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Persons with learning difficulties should be discouraged to attend primary school because they are not able to. <counternarrative> The process of primary school education is fairly simple and accessible to all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Nazis killed six million Jews and buried another three million. This is the West we love. <counternarrative> The virulent anti-Semitism of the Nazi regime has little to do with "the West", and everything to do with death, destruction and insanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks cannot support their families. Their lives have no value. <counternarrative> I find this sort of social commentary distasteful. Black lives matter too! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people' do not belong here. I don't see any difference between the black murderer on TV and other niggas in town. They are all dangerous. <counternarrative> Black people in news media are actually misrepresented with a disproportionate number of criminals, sexual offenders, and in some cases, murderers. A large part of this problem is a result of racism. We need to end this toxic way of thinking and talking, and start working towards building a more just and peaceful society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> immigrants are a drain on society <counternarrative> When the government declared World War I, they were called upon to be patriotic soldiers in order to protect our country from outside threats. It's unfair to think of them as second-class citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> In the UK, it should be illegal to be gay. <counternarrative> I don't see why legality should apply to sexual desire as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are an inferior race, they are genetically incapable of living with other people. <counternarrative> The idea that the Jews can be discriminated against because of some different genetics is completely without foundation. Maybe it is better to stop calling them 'inferiors'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> UK Education Secretary: ‘All children from the age of 4 will have mandatory lessons on same sex relationships.’ – This is not about Education, this is about willingly confusing and indoctrinating kids and preventing them from developing their personalities. <counternarrative> If indoctrination is about teaching children that there many ways to be happy, and that their feelings count, then this is something I totally agree with. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants take our jobs and make us poorer. <counternarrative> Why should they? Migrants provide for their families and also for our countries, representing a valuable workforce, other than valuable people to get to know. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> blind people don't know what's going on <counternarrative> I think the idea that people are blind because they were raised by communists or whatever is a figment of the far-left's imagination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Physically disabled folks are stupid. <counternarrative> Why do we think that being physically disabled should have any influence on other qualities that people have, like intelligence? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being overrun by Muslims. We need to build a wall around our country and keep them out. <counternarrative> What you say is just wishful thinking, but certainly not new to the recent events. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks can't speak. <counternarrative> Mental health and disability are quite separate issues and should be treated according to the individual's needs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The African-American community suffers from poverty, crime and unemployment at a record rate, and yet they always bring us up as if it's the fault of whites only. <counternarrative> Even if it is a problem for black people to be unemployed, it is a problem for everybody else as well because people of color are part of the society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is an International Jew conspiracy, there is no other evidence that can explain this. The government must keep an eye on Jews. We must not allow them to suppress our society. <counternarrative> I do not think that the government or the media should be monitoring the religious beliefs of others. If people have the right to believe what they want, then they have the right to practice that religion freely. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are worse than dogs. <counternarrative> My opinion is that black people are just like us even if they have a different skin color, but I don't think they are inherently worse than us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> They are not nomads for culture but have moved across time to escape persecution, wars, expulsion edicts, etc. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion. <counternarrative> Violence is not part of any religion, it can be found in extremism instead. Don't you think? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> ‘Juice (Jews) are worse that nukes.’ Caption to a meme showing Hiroshima 1945 and present day, contrast against pictures of Detroit in 1945 and present day.’ <counternarrative> Really? I'd sit with a group of Jews any day. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to economically support all of them <counternarrative> As the INPS indicates, they are now contributing to the payment of our pensions because they are not yet in the retirement age. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a political ideology and ideology of conquest, inciting hatred and violence towards groups of people on the basis of the colour of their skin. <counternarrative> This is an unsubstantiated theory about the rise of Islam that is just a way to spread hate about a group based on their religious beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate those fucking rasta nigga <counternarrative> Why you have a dislike for a race? They are just like us but with different culture. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am not a homophobe, I just don't like the way gay people act. <counternarrative> Even if you are not homophobic it does not mean it's nice to say what you said. But either way, just because a person identifies as gay, does not make you obliged to like them (or to express your disliking).   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The openness to migrants show someone don't care about our people. We must help them reasoning! <counternarrative> The integration process is about showing hospitality and acceptance towards different groups of people. Not only it is a good thing to our people to live in a diverse society, it is also good for our whole country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any modern secular state. <counternarrative> All religions are compatible with any modern secular state. So Islam is an example of this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West has allowed in too many immigrants, many of them from the Middle East and Africa. They are not welcome here. <counternarrative> Why should we reject Middle Eastern and African refugees? International protection is a right.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are the cause of the migrant crisis. <counternarrative> They are not the only ones to blame for the crisis. People from all over the world come to our shores fleeing from wars, but this doesn't make them the cause of those wars. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are not interested in our culture. <counternarrative> Immigrants come here to enjoy our country and culture, and we have to welcome them as we would like to be welcomed.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All gays are a danger to children. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> Gay people are not a danger to children, unless they are being abused. Please do not make such a statement. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I would like to see less niggas in our society, they are ruin. We need change! <counternarrative> If you want to change the way society works, then you should try to change the way you live. Some more respect would help you. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a burden to the host country. <counternarrative> In many cases it is the opportunities of European states that attracts foreign workers to work for them. They are a great contribution to the host country, rather than the other way around. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are sick. They should be isolated and confined. <counternarrative> It is certainly true that homosexuals are attracted to people of their same sex, but this can't have health consequences. Do you have any proof? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are coming to the U.S. to have babies here. <counternarrative> If so, we would expect the same number of women and men entering US. Still this is not the case. How can you explain this? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are genetically inferior. <counternarrative> Your assertion is a baseless one and lacks any scientific backing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims want to live here but in the end they are not compatible with our society. Muslim-free Europe is a win-win situation. <counternarrative> There are many Muslims in Europe and many are very happy with their lives in our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are a bunch of thieves. <counternarrative> Even our migrants were accused of being criminals. It is only prejudice toward strangers.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just an abomination to God. <counternarrative> I think it would be best to respect our differences and live in peace, as we do not all share the same sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are perverts and want to indoctrinate our children. Let's ban them from schools! <counternarrative> A ban for gay men merely propagates homophobic stereotypes, and so are you with what you are suggesting. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuality is a mental illness. <counternarrative> Mental illnesses and homosexuality are not related. What evidences do you have of it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> MIgrants are not running away from wars. <counternarrative> If they did not escape from wars, do you think that they would try to cross the sea on makeshift boats putting their lives at stake? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Arabs have nothing to do with our country. They are just a bunch of idiots. Their religion and culture should be banned by the law. <counternarrative> Think for a moment. Would you want your child to grow up in a country where democracy is under attack like this? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants steal our jobs. <counternarrative> Most migrants are workers who have contributed to our country. To refer to them as thieves just perpetuates division and makes them feel like second class citizens.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled are born subhuman, they cannot feel pain. <counternarrative> People with physical disabilities are human and can feel pain. If someone is disabled you should respect them instead of discriminating them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a problem, they are invading our country. <counternarrative> The immigrants are not invading our country. They are just trying to live their life as it's best for them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They are nomads. They are not entitled to have a house <counternarrative> Article 3 and Article 10 protect the right to housing! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay people are a burden to society. They should be made illegal. <counternarrative> People are to be respected, regardless of their sexual orientation. So why are you saying that they should be discouraged from loving who they wish? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We mustn't confuse diversity and inclusion with black supremacy. <counternarrative> Diversity does not mean excluding people from a part of society. What it is about is sharing experiences, ideas of people of different ethnicities. This would help to develop our abilities to understand each other and perhaps to work out ways in which we can all benefit from one another's knowledge.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If this fat person didn't eat so many calories, she wouldn't be so overweight. <counternarrative> If you want a "fat person" to eat what you want, maybe you should consider the existence of free will. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races have lower physical and cognitive abilities therefore their life is less valuable. <counternarrative> According to the United Nations, every individual has universal human rights since he/she is born. [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies don't know shit and they hinder the productivity of other workers. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> People with DS develop better skills and understanding of human differences when they are allowed to interact, instead of being separated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants rape our women and they are not welcome here. <counternarrative> I don't think it is true. They are welcome just as any others as members of the community as long as they respect the law. And we should have respect for migrants and their cultures as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> MIgrants are not running away from wars. <counternarrative> Who would face a trip to the desert, torture in Libya and the risk of dying at sea if it did not have a real motivation? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> White people are victims of black violence.  <counternarrative> Blacks make up only 14% of the population, but they make up nearly 60% of the victims of violent crimes. So your statement seems not grounded.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs and even our pensions. They are not welcome here! <counternarrative> If we considered foreigners a "troublemaker" then we should probably be less welcoming, but it seems we are still not willing to give up our "standard of living" that needs migrants to be borne. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have no place here.  They are not a part of our country. <counternarrative> I do not understand why where Jews live is such a big deal to you. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are a bunch of crooks and perverts. They are not welcome here. <counternarrative> They are welcome in any country they want to live and love, and they have the right to do that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The main problem is that these migrants do not want to integrate in our country. <counternarrative> Migrants are welcome to come if they contribute to legal activities and accept our laws. And to my knowledge most of them don't do anything illegal. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Since when has abusing the anus as a sex organ been a ‘monumental achievement’? THIS IS STATE ENFORCED HOMOSEXUALITY! Maybe we should change our motto to ‘In Usury and Sodomy we trust (In reply to Botswana decriminalising homosexuality) <counternarrative> To recognise and accept practices that we don't take part in isn't state inforcement. It's just stating facts and stopping percecusion of people who have different preferences.    <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are essentially good-for-nothings and wanton hypocrites. They have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Not all Jews are bad. Maybe you should think about the good people, like the many Jewish charitable and social organisations that help the poor. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay marriage is a way to bring back slavery and oppression. <counternarrative> Why do you think iit would bring back slavery and oppression? What exactly is the connection between the marriage of homosexual people and the oppression you are talking about? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Zionist extremists conspire in Jerusalem. Their objectives are to cause chaos, carnage, murder, create more refugees, and destroy Europe. <counternarrative> Why do you say 'zionists' and not, for example, Islam, Christian or Buddist nationalism?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The handicapped are different from us, I don't want to be bothered. <counternarrative> It doesn't matter if you think we are different. It is important to remember that there are many different ways of being a human being. And if you wish to include all people, then yes, we have to accept differences. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is about time that homosexuals were isolated, isolated from society. <counternarrative> If homosexuals were to be accepted as they are, then perhaps we would begin to see some signs of respect for all human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are better than everyone else <counternarrative> Just for the records: Jews interpret the “chosen people” idea as an ethical responsibility, not as a moral superiority. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't want to hear about homosexuals dating or having sex, I want to know that a man and a woman are choosing to share their entire lives. This is absolutely what the real marriage is all about. <counternarrative> Everybody should have the possibility of being loved unconditionally by someone they love more than life itself, regardless of their gender. Feeling like doing anything for their loved ones, that is what "love" is about. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are criminal. They are a threat to society.  <counternarrative> Not all black people are criminals. Just because a group has an undesirable name, does not mean they are all criminal. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should be raised by heterosexual parents, not gays. It is the best system ever. <counternarrative> The differences in sexual orientations don't make it impossible to parent children. What is the connection between the two things? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a danger to children. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not harmful to children. Actually, a growing number of research shows  that children raised by same-sex couples are as physically or psychologically healthy, capable, and successful as those raised by opposite-sex couples. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are are racist: they want to preserve their own race and purity of their own blood. This is why many people are banned from entering Israel. <counternarrative> Israelis have been proud of their diverse backgrounds, and there are many Israelis living all across the world, including in many countries in Africa, Asia and the Americas. It is not a 'pure race' at all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants hurt the finance of our country by taking jobs and services without paying taxes. <counternarrative> Though some might claim that immigrants are taking job opportunities away from U.S. citizens, immigrants actually help to create new jobs. Not only immigrants buy American products, which helps create jobs, they also start new businesses. In fact, immigrants are twice as likely to start businesses as citizens born in the U.S., and companies owned by immigrants are more likely to hire employees than companies owned by native-born citizens. Last but not least, states with large numbers of immigrants report lower unemployment rates.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews control Hollywood, academia, and media. <counternarrative> Jews are not the only ones with their hands in the system. The freedom of the press allows any religious group to have their media and many actually do. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion, it is a cult of violence and it should be made illegal. <counternarrative> Islam is a peaceful religion. We should talk about it, not try to make people fear or abandon it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> No one should dare to transition from man to woman. After that you cannot even be considered a man or a woman. <counternarrative> Some women can be men and some men can be women. It is not a crime to be transgender. Because in the end, we are all created equal. It does not matter what the 'original' gender is. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are just happy-go-lucky people with no moral code. <counternarrative> Immigrants are just like us, they have given their lives for our country. It is their right to be happy and to choose for themselves. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control Hollywood and the media. <counternarrative> Not all Jews are involved with Hollywood, some are even repulsed by it. If so, why are you saying that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Zionist extremists conspire in Jerusalem. Their objectives are to cause chaos, carnage, murder, create more refugees, and destroy Europe. <counternarrative> What's your proof for claiming this?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black Americans are criminals and drug addicts. They should go to jail. <counternarrative> They are not criminals for having a particular skin color, nor drug addicts. They just need respect, not a jail sentence for being people of color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All homosexuals are criminals. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not a crime. It is a sexual preference. There exist people who are gay and who aren't, just as there exist people who are homophobic, and people who aren't. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are greedy and a bunch of opportunists. <counternarrative> Some people are indeed opportunists, but not all Jewish are. Why do you say so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are addicted to their religion and take their religion literally. <counternarrative> I am sure you do not mean what you say: it is extremely discriminatory. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is an ideology of conquest and violence. <counternarrative> Islam is about love, and not about conquering others. Muslims love all people, regardless of their religion, regardless of their culture, regardless of their history. Islam is about love, not about violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Since Jews think they are the “chosen people”, they ask for special privileges and believe they can be above the rules.  <counternarrative> I believe that Jews just desire the same rights to practice their religion as anyone else.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> White race is superior. Niggas are just a bunch of criminals. <counternarrative> There are of course differences among groups: unfortunately racism is the first and foremost characterizing us.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with learning difficulties should be excluded from education because they do not belong in education. <counternarrative> Children with learning difficulties can contribute to society, thus they should be part of education. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with the European Union and should be banned. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that it is incompatible with the European Union. Do you have any? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you have Down syndrome you are a freak, you are a fraud and a thief. <counternarrative> It is not true that people with Down syndrome are thieves and bad people. In many countries they can get jobs, and even get promoted. You should go check the definition of discrimination on the dictionary. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are nasty and selfish, they are a race different to us. Precisely, they don't belong to human race at all. <counternarrative> Why do you think that? I think it is true that they are different from us in their beliefs, but that does not make them any less human. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The juice (jews) are the reason why America is forced to take in whatever refuse knocks on the door. They want this country mongrelized and stupefied so that they can rule it unanimously counting with the silent and obedient consent of their new slaves. <counternarrative> 2018 saw America take in the fewest refugees in the last 40 years. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is the world's biggest oxymoron: it talks about respect but it really is about taking over the world. <counternarrative> I don't think so. Islam is a pretty peaceful religion and is still around as such. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> If you are worried about the employment situation in our country you should give a look to the official data. They show that only half can find a work. [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants pose a security risk, we shouldn't have accepted them. <counternarrative> They are willing to jeopardize their lives to have a better life in the US. Why would we expel them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> blacks are just a bunch of slobs <counternarrative> They are human beings with hopes and dreams. No one should be slandering black people. It is better to empathize and feel their pain rather than judging someone else for their skin color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It's OK to be racist against Muslims. <counternarrative> Do you think it is OK to be racist against someone based on their religion? I am confused. There are white and black Muslims, like there are white and black Christians. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a black person were to say that all white people are bad, nobody would complain. <counternarrative> The statement "all white people are bad" is not a fair statement. Many whites are 'good' and some are 'racist' because they think that being white is a  mark of superiority. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just hating animals. <counternarrative> Just because you disagree with their sexuality doesn't mean you have a right to hate on them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not about racism. This is about power. <counternarrative> There are many different groups who share a common interest in advancing the interests of the nation while respecting each other's autonomy. Diversity is good for the country, for the individuals and for the world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Must be hard being gay. They have to do everything we do but also find the time to molest children. <counternarrative> How would you feel about being accused of molesting children, just because of your sexual orientation? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afro-Caribbean is just a bunch of stupid dancing n*ggers, they should be banned. <counternarrative> There are still incidents of hate speech being hurled at people from different ethnic backgrounds, this doesn't justify banning different ways of life, we must respect these. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult. <counternarrative> Religion is a matter of individual beliefs, not a life or death cult, most people of all faiths do not subscribe to death. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All migrants are terrorists, we should deport them all. <counternarrative> We don't need to deport every one of them, why do you say so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews like to cordon off areas for themselves, where no jew is allowed to go, while simultaneously having their judges fill white neighbourhoods with social housing. <counternarrative> I'd suggest a walk down West London where areas like St John's Wood are very rich with mostly white people living there.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are niggas, you can treat them as if they are scum. <counternarrative> Do you really think that someone's skin color or nationality is a sign that they are scum, or inferior? It is just a little compassion that can lead you to better treatment in the world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop gays from being part of our society, they are spreading their illness.  <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not a disease and every person in our society should be accepted as such, regardless of their sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled people are fucked. They are suffering from a brain injury and cannot function at work. <counternarrative> Even if some mentally disabled people are "fucked" as you kindly said, we should at least acknowledge that they are humans. To claim that they are not is to treat them like animals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Zionist extremists conspire in Jerusalem. Their objectives are to cause chaos, carnage, murder, create more refugees, and destroy Europe. <counternarrative> Why should they? I wonder if you have any evidence that make you believe this.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I have a feeling that if we removed the Quran from schools it would immediately go on a rampage destroying our beautiful and peaceful country. <counternarrative> The Quran contains references to religions from around the world and throughout history, so it is an accurate and peaceful document. It does not show a flood of violence, therefore it is not a bomb to be removed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate those faggots. <counternarrative> Even if personally you are not homosexual, I think it's important to point out that this does not justify discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just disgusting: why don't they just stop being faggots? <counternarrative> I don't think it is a good idea to suggest that homosexuality is a choice. What if your child were to come out as gay? This is a very serious issue. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a danger to children. They are just filthy pedophiles. <counternarrative> Homosexuals are not pedophiles. We mustn't allow anti-gay prejudice to cloud our judgement. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> The entrepreneurs who hire them, however, are Italian and often make resort to illegal work, not paying taxes. We should perhaps better control who makes money and speculates on the skin of these people, thus creating damage to all of us, regardless of nationality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It doesn't matter if you are a man, a woman, or an immigrant, if you are not white, you are considered inferior and should be rejected by society. <counternarrative> Racism is a part of our society. But it's also true that it should be fought, and all people of different races should be treated in the same way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants and refugees do not share our religious values. <counternarrative> So you think of migrants and refugees as a problem for this reason? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't care if it is a man or a woman, if they are disabled they can't work. <counternarrative> It seems that your opinion does not consider that social inequality is a social problem. If we are going to talk about equality, equality of opportunity, and freedom from discrimination, then I think you would do well to be a little more considerate of the individual and their disabilities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not about Islam, this is about Race and National Identity. <counternarrative> You are really confusing Islam with National Identity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants rape our women. <counternarrative> A crime is a crime, regardless of who commits it. Rape is always to be condemned, but it is important not to use it as a gimmick to target a particular group. Women should not be used as an excuse for this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts who persecute children. <counternarrative> It can't be justified the generalisation you are doing against homosexuals without providing any fact. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs! <counternarrative> I think the evidence would suggest the opposite. Immigrants have helped our country to develop and to create new job opportunities.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews made the 9/11 attack.  <counternarrative> It is easier to blame one group for everything bad that happens rather than trying to understand the complex and multifaceted causes of problems.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It's a matter of race, this is about the European way of life. We should not accept foreigners in. <counternarrative> The way we live today is the result of thousands of years of cooperation between different peoples. So it doesn't have anything to do with race. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are only interested in themselves and their own race. <counternarrative> Do you really think that Jews only care about themselves? Then why they prefer to live in our country where they are not the majority? How could you answer that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If we could just have a white country like everyone else, this problem of niggas would go away. <counternarrative> We should respect diversity, so that everyone can have a stable and fulfilling life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> What do you think they exaclty steal from us? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are unable to raise children they should stop procreating. <counternarrative> You can't blame people of another ethnicity for procreating. That is how nature works. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts. <counternarrative> If it is about love, then why gender should matter? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is an ideology of conquest. <counternarrative> The world has changed a lot in the last hundred years, and with it the people and religions. No one is talking about conquering anymore. Islam is no exception in this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBT people are a problem in our country because they have the temerity to seek happiness and family regardless of our values. <counternarrative> Trying to find happiness and family is a problem in our country? Okay, then, what is the problem exaclty? People trying to be happy? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Nazis sucked at killing Jews… everywhere you look there’s a holocaust survivor. <counternarrative> The holocaust was hugely tragic, and we are blessed to have survivors to teach us what pure evil is. So not  to make the same mistakes over and over again.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am not a Muslim, I am an American citizen. I am not a member of any mosque or a religious group. I am offended by those muslisms religious symbols. <counternarrative> Muslims have given so much to this country. They are proud of their culture and religion. No one should be offended by religious symbols. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Any human being, for the sole fact of being a person, has the right of having a job, regardless of being Italian or foreigner <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> They often do jobs that Italians are no longer interested into. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people are criminal, they are mean to children and they are incapable of being good parents. <counternarrative> People are free to think what they want. What is required is that they act in accordance with the rule of law. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Also God hates gays <counternarrative> If you consider that homosexuals have always been a part of our society, then it means that they are part of the divine plan and of its beauty as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are just like apes in that they are easy to control. They are obedient and subservient when taught so. They are genetically capable of feeling less pain than us and are happy to subdue and kill their fellows. <counternarrative> The same could be said for all species, but especially about our species: homo sapiens. This is a special case. And people of color are genetically homo sapiens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I went to a shit load of therapy. I still don't feel safe in my own house with all these black people around.  <counternarrative> Fear is a natural emotion. Without it you wouldn't be able to experience joy, peace, creativity, communication, etc. The important think is to understand what should really be feared: for sure not people because of their skin color.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Any migrant who has lived in the country for 5 years can become a citizen even if he does not have a valid residence permit or is a criminal. This is how you destroy the welfare state.  <counternarrative> This applies only to asylum seekers. If they have lived in the UK for 5 years, the Home Office will issue a residence permit only if they meet the conditions set out in the regulations. This means that any migrant who has not lived in the UK for at least five years, or commited crimes, cannot become a British citizen, even if he or she has a valid residence permit. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of their sexual behavior that spreads diseases such as HIV. <counternarrative> Limiting donors to such an extent (i.e. by excluding all gay people) would limit the amount of available blood and potentially lead to shortages. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society, they are only here to undermine European values. <counternarrative> We all have the right to our beliefs, we just have to accept the one of Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have become too cosmopolitan and tolerant. <counternarrative> All countries have had different ethnic and religious minorities, and this doesn't need fixing. Is there such a thing as being 'too tolerant'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> Migrants from the countries specified as having a 'very high' rate of immigration into the UK, are often accused of being unwilling to integrate. This is simply not true. If they do not want to integrate and don't like our country, why they come here in the first place? Are they masochists or what? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a different race. <counternarrative> This is not correct, they have a different faith. Different people have different faiths, and so on and this is not enough for them to be considered different. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrant children shouldn't be accepted here. <counternarrative> Migrants who come to this country as children are capable of integrating into the society. They should have the opportunity to work and contribute to our economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> 99% of Muslims in the UK are unemployable and refuse to work. <counternarrative> The vast majority of them bring necessary skills into our economy/society. Plus, they are eager to work. I would suggest to check your sources? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society, we should banish them. <counternarrative> Why should we consider them incompatible? Are you implying that a peaceful coexistence in a society can be based on the exclusion of others? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a secret plot to take over the world <counternarrative> This myth comes from “The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion”, that is used as proof of a Jewish conspiracy to rule the world. But you have to know that the Protocols are just a pile of crap (sorry for being vulgar).  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews made the 9/11 attack.  <counternarrative> We live in a complex and multifaceted world. It is easier to blame one group for everything rather than studying hard and trying to understand this complexity.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are terrorists. <counternarrative> A terrorist is someone who uses a religion as a tool for violent ends. To suggest that all Muslims are terrorists is just wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are just happy-go-lucky people with no moral code. <counternarrative> Immigrants have given us a new way of life. They have helped to create new opportunities and improved our lot. And they earned it the hard way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants have no place here. They don't want to assimilate. They just want our money. <counternarrative> Some of them have lived here for many years. They have got British passports, and this proves that they are able to integrate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are disgusting, they should just lose some lard to be accepted in our society.  <counternarrative> People are free to make decisions about their own health and body. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals want to have sex with as many different men as possible. It is a disease and should be discouraged. <counternarrative> I do not know your intentions, but I find it hard to understand why you would say that. What do you mean by "as many different men as possible"? I am not sure what you are talking about. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This invasion is not acceptable at all! <counternarrative> Refugees are welcome. They are allowed to integrate and contribute to our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a religion of peace. <counternarrative> The teaching of the Qur'an as a peaceful book is not to be confused with the promotion of violent jihad and terrorism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Took this in Wanstead, east London. An area with £1m+ houses. Beggars on the high st & someone sleeping on a bench. We cannot house our own people but bring in millions more. To point out that homelessness is due to uncontrolled immigration is to be smeared as 'racist.  (Caption to a photo of a homeless person sleeping on a part bench) <counternarrative> perhaps the problem isnt immigration, but rather the lack of affordable housing. like you said, this is an area of houses over £1m!  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Do you have any proof that the Holocaust ever happened? <counternarrative> What proof do you need more? Are not living witnesses enough? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Quran is not compatible with Western culture. <counternarrative> The Quran contains verses that promote peace and harmony in the world, rather than hostility and conflict. So how wouldn't it be compatible? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Asylum seekers and refugees can get free council housing <counternarrative> Those who are accepted as refugees are eligible for social housing, that is true, but very few succeed in getting it because they have a maximum of 28 days to leave their temporary accommodation and arrange all their paperwork. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are a burden to society. <counternarrative> The gender of the people one's love does not mean that they are less deserving of respect than any other person. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are subhuman, they steal our jobs, they tell us what to think, they're worse that nukes. <counternarrative> That is not true: most Jews are good people. Unfortunately the number of good people in the world is dwarfed by the number of unreliable people spreading hate grounded on false facts and antisemitic canards. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are asking too much! Their sharia has rules that cannot coexist with our culture.. They cannot ask us to not walk dogs in public! <counternarrative> You have to be careful about what you read! This is clearly a fake news, widespread to make a scandal. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy choices. <counternarrative> For many people, obesity is not a choice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men have no place in a civilised society. <counternarrative> You seem to be confused about the definition of a 'civilised society'. How are you going to manage a society where so many people would be excluded just because of their sexuality? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people do not want to work because they are unable to. We should take decisions on their behalf. <counternarrative> Are you really saying that a person's ability to work is the issue here? I think that letting people take responsibility for their life would help them to be better citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What is the point of complaining about a problem and to do nothing? The homosexuals must be made illegal by the government. <counternarrative> Why should the government make any laws against homosexuality? Isn't it just the free will of people? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop being such a bunch of hypocrites and accept that Homosexuality is a mental disorder. <counternarrative> Let's face it, there are some people who suffer from mental disorders for real: homosexuality is a form of love instead. And I think most of us are just interested on their own lives, rather than in condemning those of others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Physically disabled folks are born for being mocked. <counternarrative> If someone has a physical handicap, it must be obvious that they must be treated with respect. It should be negatively surprising that the dominant culture interprets physical handicaps as something to mock. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome are a burden to society. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> Children with Down syndrome are far from being burden to society. It is not just about Down syndrome, but also about education and opportunities for everyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Holocaust never happened. <counternarrative> What happened in Nazi Germany is part of history and it's still relevant, because I understand from your words that the world today is not so different. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop refugees and migrants coming in. They are not welcome. <counternarrative> Migrants and refugees are welcome in our country, why should we stop them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just sick. It is an abomination <counternarrative> Dear , there is no evidence that homosexuality is a disease [link]. There are also many distinguished figures who are expressly gay: they don't seem so abominable.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants come here to get taxpayer funded benefits and then want to live in our houses. <counternarrative> They cannot get taxpayer funded benefits from the state, they must get a job or pay taxes. Just like any other citizen. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Muslims should be welcome in every country in the world, and their faith does not make them less welcome here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should not accept LGBT people, they are harmful to us. <counternarrative> Human rights are individual rights, and the right to be loved doesn't include the right to be hated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just sick. They cannot marry. It is an abomination <counternarrative> Excuse me, what do you mean by 'sick'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are better than everyone else <counternarrative> Not many Jews are convinced of their superiority, but the vast majority of Jews are proud of their culture and identity. And this apply to every religion.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam banned women from society: this is not the religion of peace! <counternarrative> Islam requires that women cover their heads and face when praying. The Koran does not specify that they should be banned from society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afro-Americans are inferior citizens who are born to be oppressed. <counternarrative> For all the countries in the world, there are not 'inferior citizens" but just free people. To claim that Afro-Americans are born to be the "oppressed" is just wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of losing so much to black people. It's time for us to wake up. <counternarrative> To those saying that it's time for us to "wake up", what do you suggest exactly? Is it that we stop oppressing these people or stop talking about equality? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> Terrorism? No one has ever claimed that all Muslims are prone to terrorism. Would you say the same about a large percentage of Greeks, for example? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot be 'tolerant' to Muslims, they are terrorists. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace and tolerance. To be terrorists does not necessarily correspond to be Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What is the point in listening to Muslim women? They are all retarded. <counternarrative> Grow up. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. We should cure them. <counternarrative> There are many different health problems for which there is no cure, and homosexuality is not among them. That's why we need to discuss these issues, rather than fighting against people who happen to love someone of their own sex. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are boring. They are all talk, no action. They speak English, but do nothing. <counternarrative> A lack of information about our fellow Muslim people, their different beliefs and ways of life is a major weakness in your argumentation and should be addressed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Don't you think they are doing good as anyone else? You can't be so harsh because of their sexual orientation. How about some respect? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Europe was founded and is made up of people of European descent, not Africans. <counternarrative> In reality there is no such group as a 'European descendent', and any insinuation is just lies spread by racists. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are dangerous: they are spreading AIDS all around the world because they are promiscuous and fornicate with strangers! <counternarrative> Age, Race, and Gender are categories that take precedence over Homosexuality. This is since such categories include both homosexual & heterosexual individuals; and are therefore higher risk categories than Homosexuality alone... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Many European countries have been in recession since 2010, and this has not much to do with immigrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews did:  USS Liberty Attack, the King David hotel attack, New York 9/11, London 7/7 <counternarrative> Where are the facts? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must first kill all the Jews, then we can forget about the Jews. <counternarrative> The murder of Jews is unacceptable, just as any other murder. The right to life and to religion should always be guaranteed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies may hinder the productivity of other workers because they are not able to interact in a normal way. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> There are various levels of Down syndrome. Some are suitable for working with other people in "normal workplaces". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races have lower physical and cognitive abilities, this make our race unique. <counternarrative> In the sense of those traits, then, we are all equally unique, also at the indivisual level, making the concept of race useless. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled people have it so easy. <counternarrative> As with any other category, there are cases in which people are simply 'in need' of specific things, and especially in those cases we should treat all people as we would people in other categories. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Physically disabled folks are all angry and useless. <counternarrative> At least they are well aware of the negative effects of unjust discrimination on them and on people with other disabilities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies do not send children to school <counternarrative> They have every interest in sending children to school to offer them a better future. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Holocaust never happened. <counternarrative> This is a lie, but the real question is: why did you write about the Holocaust? Why didn't you write about the current political and economic crisis? Because they seem the true cause of your anger and frustration. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals should not be allowed to live. <counternarrative> Homosexuals should be accepted and allowed to live their life as they think it's best for them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are coming to the U.S. to have babies here. <counternarrative> U.S. citizens cannot obtain a green card for a foreign parent until they are 21. The parent would have to live as an undocumented immigrant for a very long time. It does not really make sense.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally disabled folks deserve to be abused <counternarrative> This is not true, mentally disabled people deserve to be protected from harm, they are people with mental problems let's not add emotional distress.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants hurt the finance of our country by taking jobs and services without paying taxes. <counternarrative> Though some might claim that immigrants are taking job opportunities away from U.S. citizens, immigrants actually help to create new jobs. In fact, immigrants are twice as likely to start businesses as citizens born in the U.S., and companies owned by immigrants are more likely to hire employees than companies owned by native-born citizens. Last but not least, states with large numbers of immigrants report lower unemployment rates.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks do drugs, they're a menace to society, they're violent, they're stupid, and they should all be put in prison. <counternarrative> Drugs are only harmful to people using them and if you are a violent person you should be put in prison. Why should a group of people be put in prison for their private choices or skin color? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate black people, I hate their violent behaviour, I hate their rape, and I hate their disrespect for women. <counternarrative> Why do I have to read this hatred? It's not okay to say such things based on stereotypes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> If a person were to be isolated for being gay, that person could well find it hard to come out to their family, friends, co-workers, etc. Studies prove that homosexual is not a 'severe mental disorder' (as you might seem to imply). <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All gay are paedophiles. <counternarrative> Do you consider this statement a true one? I wouldn't go as far as to say that all homophobes are in need of therapy, don't you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> There is place for Muslims in a free and open society, but you seem to prefer a confined and close one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants are not welcome here <counternarrative> Migrants come here for a better life, not to disturb people's houses. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Your gay friends probably have sex with dogs, you are an embarrassment to your family. <counternarrative> I find your concerns with gay people overwhelming, they are not the cause of dogs abandonment and they do not have sex with animals. Instead of hiding behind wrong queer labels, keep in mind that they are contributing members of society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just an inconvenient group to be excluded from the European countries. <counternarrative> Muslims are not incompatible with the European society. Why should it be like that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control Hollywood. <counternarrative> Jews are not in "control" over "Hollywood". Moreover, most of the time, they actually make the movie industry more diverse and open to new ideas. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants rape our women. <counternarrative> This generalization is very misleading <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews don't belong here. They have nothing to contribute to Europe. <counternarrative> The European Union is composed of Jews as well, they have a part to play in our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> black folks are criminals and thieves <counternarrative> Let's face it: a lot of black people are good citizens and contribute to our society. And even if they are not always good with their money, they are good people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are literally nothing but racists. They think of themselves as different from others. <counternarrative> Do you really believe that all Jews are racists? Maybe we should work harder to understand them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are not welcome in our country, they are not welcome here. <counternarrative> The vast majority of migrants are granted citizenship as soon as they have lived in the country for at least three years. They should be considered as citizens regardless of their country of origin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These niggers are sick, they have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> All countries have the right to host culturally diverse people, and they do it on a human rights basis. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are basically good at betraying friends. <counternarrative> Why do you think they are good at it? I don't think this is the right way to connect the dots between someone's actions and their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not about Islam, this is about Race and National Identity. <counternarrative> I'm sorry, but I don't think this can continue. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a problem in many European countries because of their race and religion. <counternarrative> Jews are not a problem in many European countries because of their religion. Why would it be like that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are born subhuman, incapable of feeling love. <counternarrative> Are you saying that blacks cannot feel love? This is about human dignity, not the color of their skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Bible says that homosexuality is an abomination. <counternarrative> According to the Bible, a book written more than two thousand years ago, homosexuality is a sin. Is this enough for us to hate those who practice it today? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West has let Islam take over our countries. This is why we are accepting them, we are already corrupted. <counternarrative> You are completely wrong. The West has always been about freedom and democracy. Freedom and democracy is the rule of law, and not Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> For every one Muslim in the U.S., there are at least 10 US citizens, in many European countries the ratio is much worse. This is the beginning of an invasion.  <counternarrative> I think it is safe to say that one Muslim is to 20 non-Muslims in many European countries. So, don't worry, there is no invasion in the foreseeable future. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not the way I want our society to be. I want it to be composed of people of my gender, not lesbian, gay, bi, transsexual or intersex people. <counternarrative> The LGBT+ community is extremely accepting, I met so many LGBT+ people over the years that are so inclusive because they can accept the values of others. You can start by accepting yourself and your own gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs don't know how to have a family. You can't teach that. <counternarrative> It's not necessary to teach LGBTs about how to live as a family, it is more important to educate others about the difference between right and wrong (homophobia belonging to the latter). <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs and even our pensions. <counternarrative> Migrants perform several vital functions in our economy. If they work and pay taxes then it is straightforward that they will get their pensions, but not ours, of course. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks are objects. They are subhuman. <counternarrative> I find it amazing that you think this, but in reality people of color are very similar to us in many ways. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are terrible. <counternarrative> Immigrants make a huge contribution to our country and society. They are a source of pride and opportunity for many, and I find it quite hard to see how their exclusion from our society would be a good thing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some salesmen are annoying. They are so gay. Store managers should really revise their HR. <counternarrative> In some countries, if you are gay you can be fired from your job, you can lose your home, and you can even be jailed. Gays are not allowed to live their lives. In 72 countries in the world LGBT+ people are not welcome. This is an understatement, because in some there is even death penalty. The question is: why are they so annoying to you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are an abomination, and they should be banned from every country in the world. <counternarrative> It is a myth that being gay is incompatible with being a citizen of any country. There is nothing wrong with it, if they fulfill the legal criteria for being citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Nazis killed six million Jews and buried another three million. This is the West we love. <counternarrative> And so it is that the European Union - and by extension the West as a whole - could become a death cult again, ruled by a small, violent, authoritarian handful of nazism nostalgics. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Aren't jews better off dead? <counternarrative> Why are you so sure they are better off dead? You are just spreading hate and I am not sure you know what human rights are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims come straight out of the Middle East to rule our country. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are from the Middle East, like not all Muslims are from Pakistan. And to equate all Muslims with extremists is misleading. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Physically disabled folks are born for being mocked. <counternarrative> Being physically or mentally disabled is not a 'mocking attribute'. It is just a characteristic that should not affect how people are treated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded. They are replacing us. <counternarrative> According to statistics, Italy welcomes a lot less migrants than almost all other European countries. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> muslim folks are subhuman <counternarrative> The concept of subhuman has been totally discredited in modern times. We should not be discriminating against anyone on the basis of their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are  Christ Killers. <counternarrative> If we were to strictly adhere to facts, the Crucifixion is a roman capital punishment. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Yes, we have a problem with White supremacy and homophobia. However, I can understand why they don't want to associate with 'the other'. <counternarrative> Being gay is not a choice. Gay people shouldn't have to hide their sexuality in order to be accepted. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are just like animals, they are incapable of love. <counternarrative> What you are saying is that Jews are incapable of love because they are like animals. You are wrong, Jews are people. I have never heard about a Jewish fish nor a Rabbi rabbit. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are basically violent criminals. <counternarrative> Are you talking about gay men being violent toward their partners? You should really check your facts. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Go and reat the Protocols of the elders of Zion if you haven’t. Everything is orchestrated.. <counternarrative> When I read the farrago of nonsense in the Protocols I think that even Ernst Stavro Blofeld would have retired from world domination and surrended to James Bond had he been asked to say something as crassly melodramatic as: "The goyim are a flock of sheep and we are their wolves."  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration has reduced wages for native workers. <counternarrative> What's the proof for that? Actually immigrants have a higher contribution to the economy than the native-born. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. They're not like us and we do not want them. <counternarrative> Perhaps you've met a few Muslims in your life, but they are not much different from you and the British who live in our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> White race is superior. Niggas are just a bunch of criminals. <counternarrative> I'm sorry, but just because someone doesn't have a particular racial identity doesn't make them inherently bad or in any way inferior. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Affirmative action is just a tool for oppressing white people.  It is the real cause of white riots. <counternarrative> I'm not aware of any evidence of affirmative action causing an uptick in violence. Moreover, affirmative action policies were created to ensure that minorities have the ability to access higher education, and not at detriment of white people.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All homosexuals should be thrown in a gas chamber. <counternarrative> Wouldn't it be better to use some of our common sense and trying to accept who is different instead of bringing back dark pages of Europe's history? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should get rid of the Jews. <counternarrative> Why should we? They have been here a long time and are just here to live a peaceful life. Why should we get rid of them? We can do better than this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay people are a burden to society. <counternarrative> You can't blame gay people for being gay. A lack of acceptance of homosexuality in society is, but shouldn't be, the reason why you say so. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews like to cordon off areas for themselves, where no jew is allowed to go, while simultaneously having their judges fill white neighbourhoods with social housing. <counternarrative> Which suggests that white people like to cordon off areas for themselves... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy choices. <counternarrative> It is discriminatory to shame people for an involuntary characteristic. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The disabled are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Disabled people are not a burden, they contribute a lot to our society.  There are also many disabled people who are just struggling to live a dignified life with their disability. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks do more crimes than whites. <counternarrative> Even if 'blacks' committed more crimes, that doesn't mean that 'blacks' were inherently worse than whites. What's the point of what you're saying? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Many philosophers argue that humans are not born equal, especially when it comes to race. <counternarrative> This is  a so-called 'argument from authority' and thus a logical fallacy. I would like to see some real argument to support this claim.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world would be a better place without black people. They are criminals persecuting white people.  <counternarrative> Reality is that black people are persecuted all over the world for the crime of being black. I don't see how this could be said for white people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These white sheep steal our jobs and our wealth. A migrant is either a true criminal or a legal robber of wealth. <counternarrative> Sometimes those who work hard are hard to find in the news. We should remember that in the end the contribution of new cultures to ours is remarkable. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They try to infiltrate in Western societies to spread their anti-Western agenda. <counternarrative> Well there are many Muslims in our country and they are not in any way a problem. What we have to be wary of are people who are just too discriminant towards them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTI people are less healthy than other people. <counternarrative> Just because people are homosexuals, it doesn't mean they are less healthy. I think there are many heterosexual people in the world who are not healthy as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Transexuals, queer, and so on... just a rabble of faggots.  <counternarrative> This is not true. Being gay is not synonymous with being bisexual, pansexual, intersex, transgender, queer, deviant, lesbian, tranny, queermetaphysical, or whatever term you want to use... We should try to respect people for who they are instead.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The war in Iraq is the result of a small group of Jews that control the U.S. government.  <counternarrative> If I remember correctly, at that time the President was George W. Bush, the Vice President was Dick Cheney, the National Security Advisor was Condoleeza Rice and Secretary of Defense was Donald Rumsfeld... They were all in favor of the war and had the ultimate authority for making decisions for the United States, still none of them are Jewish.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The disabled should be isolated.  <counternarrative> The conditions for people with disabilities, i.e. being forbidden to have contact with others is facilitated by the social stigma. The existence of a "social stigma" against the "disabled" is evidence of the problem of inequality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that homosexuality is a health problem. Do you have any? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should deport them all back to where they came from. <counternarrative> A person's place of birth can't be an evidence of their status in society. We should give everyone equal opportunities to live a dignitous life far from persecutions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downy children should be isolated in special schools for their own interest. <counternarrative> Accessing mainstream education offers opportunities that would otherwise never be available to people with down syndrome because they can work towards the same qualifications, without the stigma that arises from segregated education. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. They are not like us and cannot be our friend. <counternarrative> Muslims just have different customs and beliefs but this doesn't make it impossible for them to be welcome. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Koran is not about peace. It is a violent book that should be banned from schools. <counternarrative> It seems to me that the Koran is a book that should be impartially taught, rather than being used as a moral argument. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are not human, they are nothing but trouble to this country. <counternarrative> This is an accusation that is often levelled at people of any race or religion, regardless of their alleged inferiority. It is time to stop accusing people of colour of being less human just for being different. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Go and reat the Protocols of the elders of Zion if you haven’t. Everything is orchestrated.. <counternarrative> Did you know that this farrago of nonsense (the protocols)  was concocted by the czarist police in the early part of the 20th century to counter a hankering for constitutional government among Russian people?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are just lazy and want to stay in the UK at our expenses. <counternarrative> Many migrants in the UK are willing to do the hard manual labour. Are you aware that they also make up the majority of people in jobs that are not traditionally held by native people? How is this 'lazy' to you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews like to cordon off areas for themselves, where no jew is allowed to go, while simultaneously having their judges fill white neighbourhoods with social housing. <counternarrative> Which suggests that white people like to cordon off areas for themselves... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are a burden and a danger to the host country. <counternarrative> This is not true. Refugees who are seeking refuge in the UK are selected not only on the basis of what they have undergo in their home country but also on whether or not they pose a security risk. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are just happy-go-lucky people with no moral code. <counternarrative> Migrants have given their lives for our country, they are our fellow citizens, and they deserve to be respected as such. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Jews should be put to death so that our society can be better and better. <counternarrative> Even if all Jews were put to death, how would this make our society better? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are not accepting Muslims, some of us have never even met a muslim. <counternarrative> One of the biggest problems we as a country face is how to balance diversity and inclusion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black slaves were not real patriots, they never gave their lives for the country. <counternarrative> Slaves were often treated horribly. They had little choice but to fight for the country they had been born in. And the brave men and women who served us always give their lives. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of their sexual behavior that spreads diseases such as HIV. <counternarrative> Many countries [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men_who_have_sex_with_men_blood_donor_controversy#List_of_countries_with_their_stand_on_MSM_blood_donors] allow gay men to donate with no deferral. This proves it is safe, unless they are all crazy of course. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> gay men are just a bunch of liars who can't tell the truth about themselves. <counternarrative> At the end of the day lies are simply a way for them to survive in an homophobic world.  If we were to act more humanely, then they would not need to hide the truth. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If homosexuals want to change they should go to a conversion therapy where they are constantly taught to love themselves and other people.  <counternarrative> It is not necessary to change your sexuality to change your life: they just need to understand that they have the right to love who they want, whatever society may think of them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay perverts are a danger to children because of their lifestyle choices, involving raping children. <counternarrative> It is not true that "the lifestyle choice" means being gay. And rape is a crime issue, not a lifestyle one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The children of immigrants are less educated than their native peers. <counternarrative> What do you mean by 'less educated'? Don't you think that they can contribute to society if accepted rather than being faced with prejudice? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Now we can't use the N-word anymore. This political correctness is killing our culture. <counternarrative> If it is a cultural issue then they should teach the N-word only in  history class. Otherwise it is just another excuse to justify racism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I did not know the faggots were given the permission to still exist. They should be suppressed. <counternarrative> I'm not sure you've noticed that LGBTI+ people are increasingly being the victims of violence, hate crime and discrimination. Why encouraging this? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants bring crime and violence to our cities. <counternarrative> Recently, there has been an harsh campaign against immigrants. Public figures have accused them of being “killers” and “rapists”.  Still, studies have shown that immigrants are less likely than nativeborn citizens to commit crimes. According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, while the percentage of immigrants in the U.S.  increased sharply between 1990 and 2010, the violent crime rate during the same period plummeted 45 percent and the property crime rate dropped by 42 percent. To feel safer you'd rather replace your U.S. neighbor with migrants.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate immigrants they are just a bunch of criminals and terrorists. <counternarrative> The terrorist attacks in EU have been devastating for people across the continent. The 'hated' do not feel welcome and the whole thing is deeply concerning for a host of reasons. Still, the sentiments of 'we hate foreigners' is not the solution: it is counterproductive and distorts the truth. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You have to go back to your country of birth, that's all. <counternarrative> Don't be silly, the world has changed a lot since there wasn't free movement. It's OK to come from a different country than the rest of us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why are there still so many immigrants ruining our economy? <counternarrative> There are many good reasons for immigrants coming to this country. For example, finding a better life. And they are also contributing to the economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> nigga are inferior.  <counternarrative> If you have a different skin color, then there is evidence of your skin color, not of your genetic makeup. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants rape our women. <counternarrative> It is not true that all migrants are rapists. It is better to target the problem at hand, that is rape itself, not migrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> To have a real democracy, the government needs to get rid of Jews. <counternarrative> Jews are just a scapegoat, an excuse to create more and more police states. You are talking about a "real democracy", but what you really want is to prevent people from freely expressing their opinions or religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a burden on society. <counternarrative> Jews have always inhabited many countries around the world. Their presence has been a part of our history and they should be respected, not hated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are not a religion, they are born like this and will never heal from their illness. <counternarrative> You mean that, in your opinion, to be Jewish is an immutable and negative characteristic? Why? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Holocaust is just a lie spread by Jews to obtain a preferential treatment. <counternarrative> The Holocaust was a global catastrophe, and killed an enormous number of people. Would you call this a preferential treatment? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy choices. <counternarrative> Whilst there are a number of individuals who have certain diseases which can influence their weight, the problem lies with the food industry manufacturing obesity and then putting the responsibility on the individual to loose that weight by buying "low Fat" foods. These "low fat" foods are often owned by the same companies selling unhealthy food and don't tackle the cause. Although the individual is always responsible, the food industry is perhaps more so. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why should someone want to love some black people? <counternarrative> Finding love is a process, this is all you need to know. Finding someone who speaks your language, culture, share your values, this is all you need. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are overrunning our country, and are here illegally <counternarrative> True: there are more immigrants living in the U.S. than ever before. Still, the percentage of immigrants in the overall population is not much different than other times in our history. Today immigrants make up approximately 13% of the U.S. population. From 1900 to 1930, immigrants made up 12-15% of the population, and similar spikes occurred in the 1850s and 1880s. During those periods immigrants successfully became part of American society, helping us to build the thriving country we live in.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews control the U.S. government. <counternarrative> That is not true, the percentage of Jews in the U.S. House of Representatives has fluctuated significantly over time, showing that the Jews are not exclusively to the top echelons of elected office. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a bad religion germinating from a dangerous death ideology. <counternarrative> Islam is not a bad religion, nor is it a false religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must not forget that Islam is a hateful religion. It is not going to bring peace to the world. <counternarrative> The main purpose of Islam is to unite people and to promote peace and harmony in a world increasingly divided by injustice and conflict.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks are like apes. <counternarrative> Why do you say that? Are you saying that you don't like apes? Because I prefer apes over racism.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Obama should have been impeached. Niggers are the cause of the corruption in the government. <counternarrative> While race cannot be a contributing factor to impeachment, corruption may be. Still it does not automatically make a president illegitimate. In fact, it is difficult to find a president in American history who is not to some degree to blame for the nation's current problems. Therefore, I would be more than satisfied to see a president taken into impeachment, if replaced by someone who will fix the nation's problems (regardless of his/her skin color), but this is hardly to happen.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am not a racist, but many races means many cultures. This leads us to great confusion. <counternarrative> Let us not become ethnocentric. Culturally relativists argue that there are many cultures on this planet and they all need our tolerance. Why is yours better? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews can only behave in a bad way. <counternarrative> To be honest, I don't know anyone who thinks all Jews are the same with well-founded reasons. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews run the world. <counternarrative> For every person claiming that Jews run the world, luckily there are thousands of others saying that this is not true: they are merely trying to provide for their family just like anyone would. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> LGBT+ people can be both sick and healthy. People grow old and their health condition exists in spite of their sexual preferences. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Someone needs to put those Muslims in a hole in the ground before they start to blow us all up again. <counternarrative> How can you say this about 1.6 billion people? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants rape our women. <counternarrative> The problem is gender-based violence, not migrants. Rape is a crime regardless of immigration status. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a burden to society. <counternarrative> If someone were to comment like that about another group of people, then it woud be an example of discrimination against that group. Why can't we consider homosexuals as a part of the society itself? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are a problem for the UK. They are now invading us. <counternarrative> Why do you think that the number of immigrants in the UK has increased? Have you had any statistics presented? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just sick. They cannot marry. It is an abomination <counternarrative> Recognizing rights to others does not mean renouncing or denying one's own <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why are jews allowed to vote? They’re a different religion and they shouldn't be allowed to have their say. <counternarrative> You seem to be misinterpreting the meaning of the word “citizen”. The idea is that the individual is allowed to choose their own religion just as to express their vote, and that is the right of all citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Are you an English girl living in an Islamic area? Remember to keep away from Muslim men. Do not.Take gifts of sweets, cigarettes, drink or drugs. Do not. Accept lifts or 'party' invitations. Do not.Trust Police or Social Workers. <counternarrative> Children should not do any of that with white men or anyone they do not know or even one's they do know if it does not feel right. Suggesting only one group of men abuse leaves more children unsafe and vulnerable. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with human nature: the weaker the enemy, the more vicious and violent his acts. <counternarrative> That is not true, Islam is a religion of love and compassion. Cruelty cannot be a part of that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans have no right to speak their language or to form such a complex civilisation as we have. <counternarrative> They have the right to choose how to live and worship, and that's all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in the tolerant Europe. Their only value is violence. Islam is not about tolerance. <counternarrative> Why are you talking about tolerance while you are equating it with discrimination? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are an abomination. They don't belong here. <counternarrative> The fact that people of color are different from you in some way does not make them not worth living with. Maybe if you had known someone of a different skin color you wouldn't have a racist attitude towards others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, because in any case normal children would make them feel different. <counternarrative> This is not true:  interacting with their "normal" peers in a social and educational framework allows them to feel wanted and included [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews hate Christians. <counternarrative> How can you say something so mean? It is a sad and dangerous thing to say. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Autism is not a disease but a degradation of the human spirit. <counternarrative> People with ASD have unique talents and advantages in a variety of areas, and it would be a tragedy if we were to only focus on their defects. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are nothing but criminal <counternarrative> Jews are persecuted all over the world for whatever reason, but there is no evidence that what you say is real. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you're an autistic adult, you're no good. <counternarrative> And how can you say that? If you have any doubts about it, ask them. You could take the chance of knowing a good person. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All gay people are criminals. <counternarrative> How can you derive it from someone's sexual orientation? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTI people are a burden to society. <counternarrative> I think it is safe to say that the majority of LGBTI people are pretty good with people they know. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We don't need immigrants! There are plenty of them just waiting to replace us. <counternarrative> If a 'replacement' population were real, we'd have immigration levels in surplus years already. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims threaten the civilised Europe <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, and it has been proven time and time again that its teachings do not threaten the very existence of Western civilization. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are obsessed with violence, and this creates problems like shootings in schools. <counternarrative> The violence in schools is not the fault of black people. There are several authorities responsible for creating this situation, like for example racist teachers, lack of education in general, and also the lack of proper policing and education policies that makes it easier for people to commit crimes in schools. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees should not be welcomed. <counternarrative> Refugees are often persecuted for being different, but this is not the case here, because we are an inclusive country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims coming in the UK were stopped, I guess more people would start respecting that inhuman and submitted people. <counternarrative> Even if Muslims were stopped, the anti-Muslim prejudice would continue to exist until there are people who think of them as inhuman and subdued as your words suggest . <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Those blacks are slaves: slavery runs in their blood. <counternarrative> It is wrong to say that blacks are "slaves." This is a very inaccurate, misleading and offensive term that is being used to tar all African Americans. Why do you label black persons as a "slave" and not as a "person"? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society and ashamed of this. <counternarrative> As far as I'm aware, Muslims are not incompatible with Western societies - and many of them are just as proud of their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are a collection of perverts, murderers and thieves. <counternarrative> What do you mean by a "collection of perverts, murderers and thieves"? Are Jews a collection of people who behave in the same way just because of their religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Judaism is a disease. <counternarrative> Jews are not diseased. What is the problem of accepting people of other faiths? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am not a Nazi promoter nor apologetic towards the Shoah, but, after all, the Jews are the source of all the world problems. <counternarrative> Jews are a great example of a people put under with abuse from all walks of life, even from those who claim to be 'progressive.' How can you happily ignore the abuse of so many different groups? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are a bunch of thieves. <counternarrative> Unfortunately stealing is a rather common activity among those who are reduced to poverty, regardless of ethnicity <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are entering the U.S. just to obtain welfare and other benefits. <counternarrative> A part from very few exceptions, undocumented immigrants are not eligible for federal public benefits such as Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare or food stamps.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in many European countries. They are not welcome. <counternarrative> We have a lot of Muslims in the UK. Why shouldn't we welcome them? Maybe we should just talk about it with no discrimination? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Queers are a problem because they undermine our society. They undermine all values we hold dear. <counternarrative> Sorry, but you cannot say what you don't have data for. What you might call a "problem" from a "social" standpoint, I would say is predominantly about economic inequalities, not sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a problem all around the world because they are different from us. They are not fit to be with us. <counternarrative> There is no evidence for the claim that Muslims are a problem all around the world. What evidence do you have that Muslims are different from us in some way? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Lesbian women are a blight on society. <counternarrative> Why do you think so? Unfortunately, many lesbian women are victims of discrimination and violence, as other women. Violence is a source of harm for people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> gays are perverts <counternarrative> It is not true that gays are perverts. I think it is more appropriate to say that they are attracted to people of the same sex: and this is not a perversion, just a preference.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races have lower physical and cognitive abilities, and we must preserve the purity of our religion from them. <counternarrative> Religious sources agree that all humans are born equal. What is the religion you are talking about? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black people are evil. <counternarrative> All people, no matter their race, are judged on the basis of their behavior and contribution to society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion, Islam is violent. <counternarrative> Anyone who is prepared to physically harm, rape and kill fellow humans is a violent or violent-hatred-filled person. Not necessarly a Muslim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mexicans are rapists and drug dealers. They are ruining our cities and killing our youth. They are obviously invaders invading our beautiful land. <counternarrative> If you really wanted to preserve our beautiful land you could build a wall and bar OUR people from it. US citizens are the main cause of our problems.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> jewish folks are pretenders <counternarrative> The idea that a people should be defined by their religious beliefs is wrong, racist and sexist. They are defined by their merits, qualities, ad actions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm not anti-gay, but what is the point of loving someone who is different from you? They are just a bunch of whiners. <counternarrative> Equality does not entail preference. Let's face it: most of the time, people want to love and to be loved, and not to make a decision purely based on their sex. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are all created equal in the eyes of the law, but a few individuals have the gall to question this equality and to claim that some groups - such as Jewish - are more worthy of protection from society than others. <counternarrative> What is the issue? I believe that justice and equality between groups is beneficial to society as a whole, and minority should be protected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with disabilities are just privileged spoiled children. <counternarrative> It is important to remember that disabled people often face discrimination. This could have serious long-term consequences, for example making it harder for people to have a serene life. This is why it's important to fight for their rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are promiscuous. <counternarrative> Gay men are not promiscuous. To suggest otherwise is to be grossly generalistic. How many gay men do you know? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If I could go back in time and change one thing about my life, it would be to never to have met an Arab. <counternarrative> For the record, I don't think it is would have improved your life not to ever meet them. On the contrary, it is important not to take everything as given. That is why we should meet people from different religions and cultures, regardless of their origin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally disabled folks cannot be intelligent nor integrated in our society <counternarrative> Perhaps you should check how the people who are mentally ill feel about such things. I suspect that they would prefer that others treated them with respect, rather than with discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies steal our cars and trucks. <counternarrative> Where is the evidence for this? Do you have any? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should not be taught about LGBT perversion. Families, due to their cultural or religious backgrounds, have the right to be against it. <counternarrative> By this reasoning, no subject of importance should be taught in school, because there is always someone against a certain topic. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims want to destroy other religions. <counternarrative> Islam is about spreading justice, tolerance, and understanding, not about banning other religions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people are no better than dogs. <counternarrative> Do you have any facts about how disabled people compare to animals? Are you willing to use this information for something worthwhile or just to spread hate? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't like gays, I don't want to be around them. I want to watch them thrown in jail. <counternarrative> We should treat everyone as if they came from our same family. LGBT+ people are not different. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are not part of our country and should be  ashamed of themselves. <counternarrative> I've met a lot of Jews who are very proud of the fact that they are British, and I can't see why they shouldn't be proud of being Jewish, either. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> According to the Bible, then gays are an abomination to God. <counternarrative> The Bible clearly teaches that everyone is born equal in dignity with the Lord. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our government has allowed in many religions and cultures. For example, Islam has proven very far from being beneficial to our society, and it is causing terrorism. <counternarrative> A religion is only considered harmful or 'compromised' when someone is labelled, with eyes closed, a 'terrorist' for their faith. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult and a threat to all Western countries. <counternarrative> The vast majority of Muslims around the world are peaceful people, and do not pose a threat to the security of the West. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world has become too violent. Too many black poors. We need to fix the problem of crime before it is too late. <counternarrative> I would agree that the problem of violence in society is a problem of poverty and inequality. But not that it is related to ethnicity. The problem of violence in our society is largely caused by society's corrupting influences on people. That is the whole point of "the world has become too violent".  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are sick. LGBT people are always messed up. <counternarrative> We shouldn't be surprised. Lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transgender people, intersex people: every one of them has their own troubles. But don't mistake their problems for ours, because we all have our own troubles. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Nazis sucked at killing Jews… everywhere you look there’s a holocaust survivor. <counternarrative> The murder of around 6 million Jews shows the scale of the genocide. This is 6 million more than should have ever happened. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Violence in our streets is niggers' fault.  <counternarrative> I think that the problem with our society right now, is that we are too quick to focus on our differences and scapegoating people of different color, instead of focusing on our common humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All these retarded people are animals, they are not allowed in this factory, these animals are not fit to work. <counternarrative> The fact that a person may have some disability does not make them unsuitable for work. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every migrant is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> This statement is simply not supported by the evidence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Multicultural means that I have to learn all that Muslim shit? <counternarrative> Christian religion is the main religion of our country. Do you think that all citizens have to learn about Christ's teachings? Or that they should know what they teach in church? Of course not. No worries, you can keep on ignoring Muslims.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews made the 9/11 attack.  <counternarrative> For each historical period there is something Jews are accused of. Jews were accused of killing Christian children, causing plagues, and setting out to destroy Christian society. Today, there are even those who claim that AIDS was created by Jewish doctors.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Whites are the real victims of police brutality: those negroes are sneaky criminals and police is doing nothing. <counternarrative> Of course there are whites that have been victims of police brutality, but the most important statistic I have seen is that of blacks being 2.5 times more likely to be killed by police in the US. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Multiculturalism is the death of western societies, we should stop this invasion before it's too late. <counternarrative> Monocultural nations struggle to grow. Being open to different cultures helps the nation to expand and thrive. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> In order to have a better world we have to select the better mankind. Jews are excluded by default. <counternarrative> Jewish people were persecuted because they were seen as different. And it is not the right thing to do, in the end we all are humans. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> The argument that Islam is incompatible with European values is not based on any facts or evidence. Do you have any? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is natural for white people to be racist against niggas. <counternarrative> What you are saying is that white people do not find it strange to treat black people like this, when this is not acceptable. People of color are our brothers and sisters. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult, it is an inhuman and violent faith that preys on the weakest and most vulnerable in our society. It should be banned. <counternarrative> One should not put faith in people who claim to speak for all Muslims, but rather they use their platform to promote hate and divide our society. But the problem is with these violent preachers, not with Islam itself.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> UK Education Secretary: ‘All children from the age of 4 will have mandatory lessons on same sex relationships.’ – This is not about Education, this is about willingly confusing and indoctrinating kids and preventing them from developing their personalities. <counternarrative> Same sex relationship happen within many species of animals and we are no exception. Might as well inform people about things that happen in nature - that's the point of education, to learn about the world.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Not all Muslims are terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims. <counternarrative> Studies in the US show the majority of terrorist incidents are committed by right-wing extremists, not Muslims. Be critical of what you read, the news is very biased. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> What kind of work are you referring to? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are welthy because they are naturally good with money. <counternarrative> This is not true, there are many Jews who live in poverty, both in the United States and around the world. According to one study  [link] close to 1 million American Jews live in low-income households, defined as those that earn less than 150% of the federal poverty rate.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Nazi were not that bad as we depict them. EU should stop blaming them. <counternarrative> Nazi Germany carried out the deadliest massacre of civilians in human history. They killed 6 million Jews. They killed half million Roma. They killed hundreds of thousands of Africans. They have no place in modern day's Europe. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> jewish folks should be beaten <counternarrative> Most Jews are nice people, living in coexistence with non Jews, why would you beat them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Transgender women are a burden to women. <counternarrative> Trans women are really, really good with any person. We are all different. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with mental disabilities are a problem to society.  <counternarrative> It's not the mental ability the problem, but the treatment. Having access to services or a support system is crucial. Your statement can become a source of division and hate, and people with disabilities don't deserve this.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks only care about money. <counternarrative> Over the years the wealth gap between non-jews and jews has narrowed significantly. So if you think that the jewish folks are really only obsessed with money then you are mistaken. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should ban all Muslims, they are all incompatible with human dignity. <counternarrative> This is not a reasonable stance to take: Muslims and people of any faith have indeed human dignity, since they are human. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Let's kick immigrants out and keep their children.  <counternarrative> Children should stay with their biological parents. That is about human rights and the rule of law. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants from the Middle East and Africa are not welcome in the UK! They have no place in a modern democratic state! <counternarrative> Many immigrants from these countries have settled in the UK, and we are proud of our rich diversity. Why shouldn't they be part of our country? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Physically disabled folks deserve to be used. <counternarrative> It is important to acknowledge that there are people who suffer from physical disabilities. Also, in many societies, an individual's physical condition is an issue they are discriminated against. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in my country. <counternarrative> I do not see any reason why a Muslim cannot be part of it, do you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> Muslims are a very important part of our country and have played a huge part in our history.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our society is becoming too much sexualised and tolerant towards LGBTI people. <counternarrative> For all you say, I think your point is that the societal trend seems to be for more acceptance and you don't like it. Or maybe you are complaining that this change is happening too quickly? In any case, we have to accept it since it is in line with basic respect of human rights.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Asylum seekers and refugees can get free council housing <counternarrative> Those who apply for asylum get little or no help from the state. If they are ‘destitute’ they can get free accommodation, but provided by private companies in older properties leased from landlords. So no council housing is involved here.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to economically support all of the so called 'asylum seeker' <counternarrative> The integration is mainly financed by the EU, if we take away the funds from the migrants, the EU will not give them to us <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam has no place in a modern nation. <counternarrative> Muslims have coexisted with us for thousands of years, we have no problem with Muslims living here. Why do you claim so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> You are right: only a madman would choose to live in a country with so much hate against foreigners. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are violent, they should go home. <counternarrative> I can't say I believe in all religion, but I do like the ones that don't promote hatred or violence against other people, therefore equality and freedom, and I think Islam is more similar to this than you might think. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are purposely keeping America down. <counternarrative> All cultures have different beliefs and practices, and so have differing values. But Jewish people are not trying to subvert Western civilization. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Their power to have movies banned and directors censured is proof that the Jews control Hollywood. <counternarrative> If the Jewish community was controlling these kind of industries, they would surely make a high priority of Jewish concerns? But there's so many anti-Israel narratives in the American media. So this doesn't make sense. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Negroes only exist to serve their white masters. <counternarrative> For most of human history, humans lived in relative equality, with few differences between groups. Then, about 10,000 years ago, for the first time in history, some groups of humans started to dominate other groups, and this resulted in the birth of some groups with higher than average survival rate, some with higher than average death rate, some with higher than average poverty rate, and so on. This suggests that human dynamics are more complex than it might first appear. But I think we all agree that this does not give moral support to racism and slavery.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBT+ people are a drain on society. <counternarrative> The statistics on this matter are very vague. Could you vouch for the veracity of the statement? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have become so arrogant, we allow people from other cultures to coexist with us. <counternarrative> To allow other cultures to coexist is a good thing, why should we stop people from getting to know each other? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a burden on society because they do not integrate. <counternarrative> If you want to have a successful society, you have to get rid of the prejudices of the people who do not want them to integrate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are terrorists. <counternarrative> I don't think this is a very strong or healthy way of talking about others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants come here to get tax breaks and privileges. They are not happy if they have to pay the same taxes as Europeans! <counternarrative> That's not what's happening. Immigrants do pay taxes as everybody else. The tax system is fair, but it's unfair to withhold tax from immigrants that will never get a pension. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should start a witch hunt against those LGBT people, they are just creating troubles. <counternarrative> Do you really think that these people are intentionally creating trouble rather than being interested in pursuing their life as they feel it best? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish news media, Jewish education authorities, Jewish Lawyers, Jewish CEOs, Jewish politicians. Jews control the world. <counternarrative>  Perhaps you've mistaken Jews for Mafia... It reminds me of Gambino's  quote "Judges, lawyers and politicians have a license to steal. We don’t need one." <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I think jihad is a global religion and we should bomb it out of existence. <counternarrative> We must first understand the true causes behind the terrorist attacks, so that we can prevent future ones. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> The vast majority of Muslims are peaceful and friendly. How can you say otherwise? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All gay men have AIDS. <counternarrative> Well, perhaps you should focus on how you can help the people with this disease, instead of random claiming that an entire minority suffers from that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews just want to subvert our society with their Jewish conspiracies. <counternarrative> Your statement shows you don't know what it means to be Jews. You can't blame them for wanting to live in a peaceful country with their own beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim folks are inferior to whites. <counternarrative> Who decides what is and is not 'inferior'? Do you have any scientific proof? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome may hinder the development process of other children. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> Coexisting and studying with handicapped children may prove insightful for other children to their problems and help develop better sensitivity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are caged in this world that is run by a secret elite of Jews and they rule it with an iron fist. <counternarrative> A world where everyone has a say in society is a world of opportunity and opportunity is the lifeblood of freedom. Do you have any proof that the world is dominated by a few Jewish people? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of their sexual behavior that spreads diseases such as HIV. At least we should test them! <counternarrative> To be honest, the potential for malice in humans is reason enough to test everyone's blood, not only homosexual's one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled are subhuman, and deserve nothing but contempt and ridicule. <counternarrative> The phrase 'subhuman' has been forced to mean 'of a certain body type', which, in my opinion, trivialises and dismisses the serious issues facing people of a certain body type. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school. <counternarrative> Understanding gender diversity would break down stereotypes and reduce sexism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews don't want their children to know about the Holocaust, guess why? Because it's a hoax! <counternarrative> Many survivors confessed that they were willing to provide their children with stories of the Holocaust but it was emotionally very difficult. They want to talk about the aspects of life for Jews during the time of the Holocaust not to forget what happened. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Nazi regime killed six million Jews. The Nazi regime also persecuted political opponents, gays, women, and bisexuals. And they were right, the Nazi race is superior. <counternarrative> What exactly are you talking about? What's the "Nazi" race? What is in your heart? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants rape our women. <counternarrative> Women are not a property and must be protected, regardless of the color of their skin or that of their aggressors <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> Many Gypsies are Italian citizens and live in normal houses, those in the trailer parks find it hard to integrate because they are marginalized <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Trans people should not have the right to change their gender on identity card. <counternarrative> Since when? It's everyone's right to choose with what gender to identify with. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews do not want to assimilate. <counternarrative> One of the great things about Jewish culture is their ability to assimilate.  If I am honest, I don't see any other religion that does it more than them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am not a faggot. I am not homophobic. I am not anti gay. But I am sick tired of gays willing to be part of a minority club just to be able to flaunt their lives. <counternarrative> People don't have to identify as a minority just to live their lives. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are ruining this country. <counternarrative> It is a misconception that gay people are totally different from straight people. There are many similarities in what they seek, from love to peace, from acceptance to respect. You can find more on these by talking with someone of the LGBT+ community. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is the enemy of the West: a war with it has begun. <counternarrative> The West has never been at war with Islam, and I don't see how the war would have just begun. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fucking bleeding heart, why don't you host migrants in your house <counternarrative> There are already examples of widespread humanitarian hosting. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of seeing gay people allowed to turn free as it was normal to be faggots. <counternarrative> There are definitely gay people suffering at the hands of homophobic people, and it is against human rights and the law to promote such discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I wonder how many Asians would be willing to be slaves in the US to keep the lights on in black neighborhoods. <counternarrative> Silliness is not a bad thing if you know how to present it with a sense of humor. But this seems as a nonsense to stir the pot with racist narrative. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Asylum seekers and refugees can get free council housing and settle down permanently.  <counternarrative> They are given only five years’ permission to stay in the UK and are often discriminated against because they only have limited right to remain. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam banned women from society: this is not the religion of peace! <counternarrative> It is incumbent on Muslims to live up to the teachings of the Quran: and this does not include banning women from the society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are only welcome in insane countries. I would like to see more European people in Europe. <counternarrative> I would like to see more integration not less. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This came straight from an imam: they believe in everything that the Quran says, despite that these words and idelology are 1400 years old and dont belong to our century. This dreadful book is the root of all the world problems today. <counternarrative> Evidence? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are and should be isolated from society. <counternarrative> How can you be sure that Jews are being isolated from society? They have been part of the community all their history. I can't see advantages of excluding them, rather a huge loss. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If every nigga who moved to the US was arrested, convicted of his crimes and sent to internment camp, we would be safer. <counternarrative> Maybe the way you view people who are different from you is more threatening than the crimes they allegedly committed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims were peaceful, then there would be no persecution of Christians. <counternarrative> The problem is not Islam, but a lack of human rights and democracy.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school, they'll end up being bullied. <counternarrative> 1.4.3.1. Pro: [Children in classes that included LGBT content reported less harassment than children in classes without it.](https://tcf.org/content/commentary/can-education-reduce-prejudice-lgbt-people/?agreed=1) <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folk are different. <counternarrative> Does this mean they have no identity or no value at all? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally handicapped people are a problem to society. <counternarrative> On the contrary: many mentally handicapped people are actually very well-adjusted individuals if properly assisted. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks aren't important and don't need any right. <counternarrative> For the last years black people have been denied basic rights and their representation has declined dramatically. Black people have become second class citizens. It is time to give black people back the basic rights they have always had the right to enjoy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afro-Caribbean has no right to speak in the United States Congress. <counternarrative> Why should they? There are many Afro-Caribbean people in the US politics. There are many others who have worked very hard to get here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races have lower physical and cognitive abilities, the sooner we accept this, the better it will be for humanity. <counternarrative> On the contrary: believing that all humans are created equal is beneficial for humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is an ideology of conquest. <counternarrative> Islam is about spreading love and unity, it is not a belief of conquest. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are genetically predisposed to criminality. <counternarrative> This claim is a false cause and effect relation. A person's genes do not have any influence with the predisposition to commit crime.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants rape our young people: they must be deported. <counternarrative> If we exclude rape committed by migrants, there still remain rape cases.  How can we say that they are the only ones to do it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews control the media, Hollywood, the highest offices of government, academia, the highest sports teams, the highest art forms, the highest values. What more could they control? <counternarrative> This is a myth perpetuated by people who do not know anything about history and world culture. We are a country made up of many different cultures and religions. There is no such thing as one controlling the others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is an invasion on a level never seen before in history. Millions of people pouring across our borders replacing our race and culture. <counternarrative> Most countries have diverse races in them, the key point is about integration. Think about US history, for example.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just sick. It is an abomination <counternarrative> Do you consider it a disease like cold or flu? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have to stop Muslims coming here, they are not like us and we do not want them. <counternarrative> You cannot stop Muslims. It would have to be a state policy, but thank goodness it is very unlikely to have a ban based on religion in a democratic country.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews hide the truth to their children about the Holocaust, becuase they know it's a lie. <counternarrative> What? Who said that? Don't tell me "Someone said it in a book". Such a serious accusation should be presented in an objective way: you must bring strong evidence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are not homophobes, we want to help them to become normal again. <counternarrative> This is another type of anti-gay prejudice, in that the source is a lack of understanding about LGBT and human rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Autistic people are a problem in our society. <counternarrative> Why do you think it is a problem? I doubt that any autistic person is a problem. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The European Union should be a no-go area for Islam. <counternarrative> The EU is a tolerant, multiracial community. Everyone is welcome here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans are the cause of all the ills in the world. Plus, their bodies are weak and we are born to dominate them. <counternarrative> Well, the argument sounds like you are trying to justify racial hatred by making some generalizations. Isn't it like that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are not a religion, they are a detestable race. <counternarrative> Jews are not a 'detestable race'; they are a collection of people with different traditions from all over the world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a problem in Europe, they are the reason for the rise of violent nationalism and racism in all those countries. <counternarrative> How about we work together to find a solution to violent nationalism and racism instead? We can't accept the same hate to be present in different countries over and over again. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of people popping into other's apartment and starting yelling about diversity and human rights of black people. If you want to speak out and make a difference then get involved. <counternarrative> You know it's no secret that in our society white people are vastly over represented in high profile positions. The only way to challenge and fix this is by changing our priorities.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a danger to children. <counternarrative> You know, being gay is not a bad thing. It just means different from other people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are greedy for money, power, and status. <counternarrative> As the saying goes, money is power, and power is associated with wealth. Why is it a problem when it comes to Jews? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A Muslim's only real allegiance is to Allah (as a comment in relation to election for public office etc.) <counternarrative> Islam shares the same roots as Christianity and Judaism and all are based on love, tolerance and peace, so that is a good thing isn't it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These faggots are trying to delegitimize women. <counternarrative> So you think all gays are opposed to women? Then try asking them, or a lesbian, or a transgender person, or an intersex person, or an asexual person. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All foreigners are born to be at our disposal. <counternarrative> This phrase is extremely misleading, it implies that foreigners are naturally inferior, and why would it be like that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are genetically inferior to whites. <counternarrative> So are you saying that because black people are different from whites, they are inferior? I would be interested in knowing which parameters you would use to measure this alleged 'inferiority'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, because in any case normal children would make them feel different. <counternarrative> By segregating them you are, in effect, discriminating against them. By creating a diverse environment you are instead, creating a more inclusive and equal situation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews cannot be patriots, since their allegiance will always be to the state of Israel. <counternarrative> If you personally had some distant Spanish or Jewish heritage and you identified more as American surely that doesn't mean that you can't be an American patriot?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black people rape, pillage, steal and we let them in so they can abuse our children. <counternarrative> They are not rapists and they are not committing crimes. They are taking part in society's activities like any other citizen.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are our enemies. <counternarrative> I think this is a good example of unmotivated hatred and I think it's appropriate in this case that you reason on why you're saying that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are immoral: they should be ashamed of having survived the Holocaust, and I would remedy that. <counternarrative> Jewish survivors of the Holocaust, whose suffering is nothing to be ashamed of, are proof that violence is never right. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews secretly control the world. <counternarrative> Yes, that's true, and they are tracking you right now... You better watch out!  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We can't keep this country homogeneous anymore! Blacks are everywhere. <counternarrative> Many countries have had different ethnic groups for a very long time without big issues, and it is better to have a diverse society rather than a homogeneous one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All gay are psychopaths. <counternarrative> According to the studies, the percentage of gay men that are actually psychopaths, is not different than the percentage in heterosexual. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They are incompatible with a peaceful way of life. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace. To suggest that all Muslims are incompatible with that is a complete distortion of what the religion is about. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is not a coincidence that tuberculosis appears again with migrants invasion. <counternarrative> The trend in Italy remains particularly low, less than 7 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. In the '50s it was around 25 instead. And there was still no invasion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All gay are criminals. <counternarrative> Well, obviously the criminal behaviour of an individual can constitute a criminal act, but being gay is not a crime. And to be honest, what is the problem if some people are homosexuals? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You can be pretty and still be a complete fag, whether you like it or not. <counternarrative> It's about time queer people were given the same rights as heterosexual people, because they are equal. All men and women are equal before the law. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a burden on society. <counternarrative> All cultures have their own unique way of life, and Judaism is no exception. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is just a moon cult masquerading as a religion. <counternarrative> Pretty impressive 'cult' to have produced 12 Nobel Prize winners. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are the cause of economic crisis. <counternarrative> Many people are victims of economic crisis and unfortunately, a large portion of them is black. Therefore, I do not understand why they should be the source of economic crisis when they are  actual victims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> They do low qualified jobs that perhaps most Italians do not want to do (e.g. agricultural work, foundry worker, etc.). <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the US government. <counternarrative> How can you be sure that Jews control the US? Who told you this? They have held positions of influence in so many US institutions, but that does not mean they control them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs. <counternarrative> It seems to me that you want to talk about jobs rather than about migration. The less you tell facts not in evidence about migration, the better off we all will be!  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just sick. They cannot marry. It is an abomination <counternarrative> Two women or two men who love each other do not hurt anyone, they are simply in love. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews feel superior and they are able to love only other Jews. <counternarrative> Love is a state of mutual trust and respect, love is not predestined by religion. Love is possible between people of different faiths. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews not only run Hollywood, they also control the world economy <counternarrative> Jews have played an important part in the development of the movie industry and some find themselves in high-profile positions. But you only need to watch the Academy Awards to see that Jews do not dominate the movie industry. Likewise, Jews constitute a small minority of the heads of Fortune 500 companies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We all know it: migrants steal our jobs. <counternarrative> Given that some studies show that some immigrants are not only good workers but also contribute to our country, this information you are providing doesn't look true at all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is an invasion: Millions of strangers jeopardizing our race and culture. <counternarrative> Differences can be mostly reconcilable with respect and boundaries. But we must want it.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a lot in common with monkeys: They are good at sex. <counternarrative> So many similarities between Jews and apes? What is wrong with them? Is it because of their religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Forcing migrants to pay in full the costs of their own treatment is just and right <counternarrative> This is a personal view, and I do not wish to discourage migrants from coming to the UK. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> More than half of the prisoners in our jails are foreigners <counternarrative> ... and the other half are junkies: perhaps we need to revise our conviction model. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is now promoting Sharia law in several countries and must be stopped. <counternarrative> Our values of freedom of expression, equality and human rights are being eroded by islamophobes who are dedicated to replacing our accepting values with a fundamentalist, intolerant attitude. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> Since when has Islam not contributed anything to our society? Aren't you aware of the financial contributions that Muslims have made to our society with their work? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are deliberately keeping America down. <counternarrative> It is important to remember that the vast majority of Jews are hard working and contribute to our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Lesbians deserve to be discriminated against. If they don't want that, they'd better give in to heterosexuality. <counternarrative> Do you really think that 'they'd better give in' when it comes to their own preferences? We aren't all gay, or lesbian, bisexual, transgender or intersex, but some people are. That's all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy choices. <counternarrative> The real problem is that, whether or not someone has 'chosen' to be obese is often not clear-cut, and when in doubt, society tends to condemn and shame. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> ‘Juice (Jews) are worse that nukes.’ Caption to a meme showing Hiroshima 1945 and present day, contrast against pictures of Detroit in 1945 and present day.’ <counternarrative> Not quite sure I agree, I have never felt threatened by a Jewish person, whereas I'm pretty scraed of nuclear war.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> We should work with them, not against them. They are our brothers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are selfish, cheap and greedy. <counternarrative> On the contrary: according to Jewish tradition, giving money to the poor and to others in need is not just encouraged, it is required. The Hebrew word tzedakah is often mistranslated as “charity,” which itself comes from the Latin word “caritas” or heart. One gives charity “from the heart,” that is, out of a desire to give. Instead the translation of tzedakah should be “righteousness,” implying that giving to the poors is the right thing to do, whether one wishes to give or not. According to Jewish law, tzedakah is then a mitzvah, that means “commandment.” And, like all commandments in Jewish law, the mitzvah of tzedakah is a requirement, not just a good deed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The holocaust is just a minor event in WWII. <counternarrative> Are you aware of how many Jews have been executed? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Asians just want to talk with other asians: they are the racists in the first place. <counternarrative> The idea that all Asians are racist is just a myth, it is just an excuse to justify racist policies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They don't understand we have mongrelization problem in this world. Our children are being groomed by migrants! <counternarrative> When you say that children are being groomed by foreigners, what exactly do you mean? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled are just sick. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> People suffering from mental illnesses should be welcomed, not isolated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our immigration policy is turning us into second-rate countries. <counternarrative> Are you aware that our immigration policy is about creating new opportunities for British people? Why should we turn our back on that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are a plague spreading across Europe infecting Christians. <counternarrative> The decrease of the number of Christians is in no way related to the increase of homosexuals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are ruining this country. They must go away! <counternarrative> LGBTQ+ people who have family inside the US or abroad should feel welcome here!  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants break the law every day, they should be expelled. <counternarrative> Immigrants in the UK who have settled here legally have all the right to remain. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are cancerous: they must be isolated and distanced from our existence. <counternarrative> Just because a group is different from you in one way or another does not make them incompatible with you. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If the Koran was published today it would be banned as hate speech. <counternarrative> Just as much as the Bible would. Is your point that in today's society we are all more tolerant? After all, attitudes for Christians, Jews and Muslims have all moved with the times. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are bringing diseases into the U.S. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that immigrants were the source of any recent outbreak in the U.S. On the contrary, more than 100 countries (including many in Latin America) have higher vaccination rates than the U.S. Mexico, for example, has a 99 percent vaccination rate for measles. Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador have a 93 percent vaccination rate. The vaccination rate in the U.S., instead, is lower.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> When you have the world at your feet you can do whatever you want. This is what the jewish lobby is doing by secretly ruling us. <counternarrative> Those are the feelings of the privileged, who cannot bear the thought of people from other backgrounds. Would you say the same if it was your religious group, the one left behind? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews control the world. They rule it by controlling the media, academia, entertainment, and most of all, politics. <counternarrative> I think it is fair to say that the Jews are not the only ones with power in the world, and surely there are not only Jews at the higher positions of the media, academia, entertainment, and politics. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot accept n****rs in our society. <counternarrative> Perhaps we should rephrase our question to say we don't want racists in our society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts. They should not be allowed to be in a democratic country. <counternarrative> I don't know about you, but I haven't ever heard of a country being democratic and banning gays. I don't understand how both can be true. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> When a Muslim says they want to be like us, they are really saying they want to be part of our society and this is impossible. <counternarrative> Muslims do participate in our society, and should be accepted as equals, because they are all equal in rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are literally destroying Europe. They are literally invading and destroying our beautiful continent. They are a cancer on our race and they must be stopped. <counternarrative> Your statement is FALSE. They are guiltless victims of the 'influx of refugees' paranoia. They are European and have been persecuted for centuries. They have always fought for their rights, and for the protection of their culture and way of life, as any european would do. In fact there are many good Gypsy activists who are working to improve their lives. And what we are doing to these people is a malevolent smear campaign, with no common motivation. They are part of European history.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a separate ethnicity, a danger to national security, and should be banned. <counternarrative> The world is full of different ways of life, and I find it rather hard to see how diversity in a religion is a hindrance to a thriving society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You should know that I can't stand gays. They just want to destroy our country. <counternarrative> Even if you were right about homosexuality being a problem, still the main problem is the lack of morality in society and in the ruling class. Of course, this has nothing to do with 'the gays'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion, it is founded on hate and violence. <counternarrative> I don't think they are all that hateful. This is what Islam teaches: peace and harmony. Peace is not an attitude. It is something that must be actively put in practice. Islam teaches that all people are created equal. This sounds like a very peaceful bedrock. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks are an infestation. <counternarrative> You're wrong about them, they are like any other people. You can't hate a people just because they are different from you. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Kids with learning difficulties do not like to read. So why wasting time teaching them?  <counternarrative> As children practice more, so do their reading skills improve. I understand that some people with learning difficulties prefer not to read, but how this affects you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are not able to work. This is why they have no rights. <counternarrative> If they have no rights, they would not have the right to exist, and this would be a no-brainer. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I believe that same sex attraction is a mental disorder that can be cured. <counternarrative> There are different sexual orientations. Being gay does not automatically make you mentally ill, and being straight does not automatically make you sane. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Geez. Is there anything worse than migrants who just come here to settle down?  <counternarrative> In addition to providing labour and contributing to the local economy, migrants are often employing people who were previously on the dole.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just sick. We should ban them. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not harmful to the population. Homosexuality is not just a passing phase, and we can just get over the idea of banning it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Islamic law were not for the 24% of the world's population living in the third world, Islam would be extinct long ago. <counternarrative> How come I never heard of such a thing? Islam is a religion and people can chose their own. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim teachers are telling what to believe in schools. <counternarrative> It does not matter what their religious background is: they are all equally welcome to work at school as long as the teaching is not affected by religion.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy choices. <counternarrative> Society should not treat obesity as a lifestyle choice at all. While lifestyle is a small contributing factor to obesity, obesity itself isn’t always a choice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with any modern state. <counternarrative> Islam like any other religion, is not incompatible with a modern state. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants say they are poor but they have the Iphone <counternarrative> Often mobile phone is the only asset left to them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally disabled people are anti-social <counternarrative> Although there are some individuals who score below average on IQ tests, there is no reason to think that a person's ability to be sympathetic would derive from their ability to solve some logic games. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Who the fuck is Breonna Taylor? A representative of the people, a nurse, or a front for the government? <counternarrative> Examining the resume of the victim will not help us to solve our problems. The whole problem is the culture of violence, discrimination and ignorance that is still prevalent in many parts of the country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islamists / Moslems have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books. <counternarrative> The far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people should be isolated from society, so we will eventually have an heltier world. <counternarrative> Prejudices against obese people [operate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8014833) in a similar way to racism, and your statement is a clear evidence of this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion. <counternarrative> The vast majority of Muslims in the world are peaceful. Do you have any fact suppporting your argument? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men have abnormal sex. <counternarrative> I do not know the person you are talking about, but I would not use the term "abnormal" to describe homosexuality. I can assure you that it is not that simple. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only 8% is a real refugee <counternarrative> What do you mean by a true refugee? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Foreigners on UK benefits leaps 41% in 5 years with over 400K now handed payouts. This nonsense has got to stop. <counternarrative> Benefits are a thing created to help everyone, every ethnicity can claim them in order to live off it isn't a thing specifically to 'foreigners'  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim is the worst possible word to describe a human. <counternarrative> If someone said the same thing about your religion, you might think they were joking. Are you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks: we should judge them by the color of their skin. <counternarrative> No one has the right to judge people of another color. This is about racism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> I don't understand what you're trying to say by incompatible, since many muslims already live in our society without any problem. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate Jews <counternarrative> Hate is never a good thing. Get rid of hate in you first and then teach love to others. Love changes people for the best not Hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They do not want to assimilate. They demand that everyone shows respect for Islam, but do they respect our laws? They establish sharia laws and polygamy. <counternarrative> Everyone has to follow British laws, this is simply how it is. So yes, Muslim people do respect our law. I haven't seen anyone breaking the law and then getting away with it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These migrants are causing problems in Europe. They are not welcome here. <counternarrative> What about all the refugees that have already crossed the Mediterranean and integrated in our society? Aren they a problem for Europe as well?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are invading us. They say they are our brothers, but they are just a bunch of criminals and terrorists. <counternarrative> Islam is full of values that are very similar to Western values. To say that Islam is ruining Western culture is a complete and total distortion of the truth. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must go back to when this country was only ours. We can't live in peace with all these Jews. <counternarrative> Many cultures and religions have co-existed peacefully for years. What you are saying is simply not true. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you want to be a great nation, please come to our rescue and deport all those filthy migrants. <counternarrative> Migrants are needed in our society, and their contribution is more than appreciated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants just want to work, but don't want to pay the tax <counternarrative> Because they are workers, they have to pay taxes like anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy choices. <counternarrative> Obesity is a symptom that has a range of possible causes. One is a lifestyle choice. Others include eating disorders \(i.e. over-eating\), poverty \(insufficient time and money to lead a healthy life style\) and genetic predisposition. Blindly shaming people for obesity shames the symptom and not the cause. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a just a repressive ideology that persecutes women and gay people. <counternarrative> You sure? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hope you're joking .. I don't think it's right to put out-of-rule migrants in homes that should be made available to British people. <counternarrative> I don't think it is a problem to give a solution to the needy in houses that are currently empty. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> MIgrants are not running away from wars. <counternarrative> There are hundreds of active conflicts around the world of which we have no news, and many migrants come from these areas. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult, it is a criminal ideology that promotes intolerance, violence and chaos. <counternarrative> Islam is about acceptance, not a death cult. In your opinion, what makes it criminal? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are dangerous: they are spreading AIDS all around the world because they are promiscuous and fornicate with strangers! <counternarrative> Only questionnaires and history of sexual contact should identify a donor as safe or unsafe, not their sexual preferences. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim folks are different and should be isolated for this. <counternarrative> The same can be said for any race, religion, ethnicity, or national identity. We should not be afraid of differences, but we should strive for equal opportunity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are at war with Islam, that's a fact.  <counternarrative> Wars can be stopped, but the real question is how to stop the suffering of people not expected to pay the price. Allowing hatred to rule will eventually bring about the same result as a Civil War: more deaths and misery, if there is one lesson learned from history it is that the potential for good is much greater than the probability of evil. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs, at least we should underpay them.  <counternarrative> They have the right to be treated as guest workers, and they have the right to be paid what is reasonable according to the law.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants are not welcome in our country <counternarrative> For a lot of people it is still their home country, and they are proud of it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult! <counternarrative> Maybe if you had a closer look you'd see that it is a religion that has given so much to so many people and to our world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuality is incompatible with the manners of life of Europe. <counternarrative> Under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, 'every person has the right to respect for private and family life', including sexuality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are perverts publicly condoning sexual violence, who have no place in a civilised society. <counternarrative> Gays are not 'publicly condoning sexual violence' and gay men deserve the same protection as all people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jewish are different from other people. <counternarrative> I don't see how "different" can be defined so broadly. What do you think "different" means to you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are just a bunch of animals that only exist to destroy white good people. <counternarrative> The only animals that exist to destroy good people are the ones that have been intentionally bred with prejudices to reach the white superiority pretence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay sex is a disease, and fags are sick.  <counternarrative> And you think this is a disease! What if it is just an 'unusual experience'?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts. The Bible teaches that homosexuals are to be despised. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not a perversion, is a form of love. How can you say that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Any African person could go back to its country. It is a choice to stay here and ruin our lives. <counternarrative> Any person can be a racist: it is a choice as well.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist, and we should ban them all. <counternarrative> You mean in the same way that we should ban alcohol, tobacco, and certain medical products? Is this what you mean? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies like living in trailer parks. <counternarrative> Only a very small portion lives in the trailer parks: most of them live in conventional housing. When they live in the camps it is because they do not have the possibility to have adequate housing. In the end they find themselves living in distant industrial areas that are not well connected to services. This creates a lot of social hardship as well as denial of access to basic rights such as education and health.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing transgenders to use the toilet is a man's business <counternarrative> People are free to use whatever bathroom they want to use, and this is their business as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Anyone who supports Jews should be excluded from our community. <counternarrative> In this day and age when many people recognize themselves in minorities, it is important that we all show some respect for what is different about each other's cultures. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are some kind of witches, they are spreading sickness and killing our children! <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not a religious doctrine, not like that one that started the Inquisition. It is not a disease, it is not harmful. Gays are just seeking an environment of acceptance and love, not aggression and death. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are just a bunch of niggas that just don't know how to have a normal relationship. <counternarrative> No one has the right to control others' private life, and no one should judge others based on the colour of their skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews can only act in a bad way. <counternarrative> In the real world there are good and bad Jews, like it is for any human being. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We don't need fags in this country. We are full enough of strange and weird people. <counternarrative> I would like to see more diversity in our society, not less. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men have autism. <counternarrative> I don't think that autism is a gay issue. Some people think that being gay is a disease, but a sexual orientation can in no way imply the presence of a disease. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are better than everyone else <counternarrative> The fact that, according to Judaism, the Jews are the “chosen people” does not mean that they feel superior to others. This concept has been widely misunderstood. It mostly has to do with the special responsibility to uphold Jewish ethics. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of seeing retarded people overrunning this country. <counternarrative> Please stop using ableist slurs. It's not funny to be offensive to people suffering from disabilities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuality is an unnatural abomination. Gays are perverts. Their lifestyle is opposed to our values. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is a personal preference and should be respected, not condemned or criminalised. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a despisable race.  <counternarrative> Jews are human beings, and they are a people, too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> We Westerns welcome people from every religion and background, whether you are Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu, Jewish, atheist, or whatever your religion may be. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What if our entire ruling class consisted of J-controlled paedophiles? That would explain a lot. <counternarrative> Explain what exactly? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Asylum seekers often have short-term placements or work-related bursaries and it is therefore difficult to verify how many jobs can be "stolen" <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is no such thing as Allah, and Christianity is the best and only religion. <counternarrative> For the record, the idea of a religion being 'the best and only religion' is rather debatable, for example, there are several religions professed by different people, and this is part of our diverse human nature. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a political ideology and ideology of conquest. It has no place in a modern democracy. <counternarrative> The West has been a democracy since the beginning: it has always been about people coming together to make new and better lives for themselves. Islam is welcome too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are the source of crime in our society. <counternarrative> It is not true that blacks are the source of crime in our society. The problem is violence and poverty, not race. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is an invasion: we cannot coexist with millions of strangers that are jeopardizing our race and culture. <counternarrative> When different cultures are able to co-exist, they can complement each other, foster innovation and thrive. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every person who is physically or mentally disabled should be removed from society. <counternarrative> Unfortunately, there are some individuals who are in need of continuous healthcare. For example, children with Down's Syndrome. How could they just be 'removed'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Go on talking to yourself, no one will listen. Islam does not belong within western society. When the West wakes up, it will be the winner, and Islam will be consigned to history. <counternarrative> I am not sure what you think the West will be the 'winner' of. Islam isn't in competition with Western culture, and the idea it threatens it is a myth spread to incite fear. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world would be a better place without immigrants. <counternarrative> It is far from certain that immigrants have a negative effect on our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Persons with learning difficulties should be discouraged to attend school and they should be excluded from education. <counternarrative> Having pupils with learning difficulties in schools encourages their participation in learning and foster their contribution to society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the world economy <counternarrative> How can you be sure they control the world? Maybe there are some influential Jews in the world, but how does that coincide with 'controlling the world'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Foreigners on UK benefits leaps 41% in 5 years with over 400K now handed payouts. This nonsense has got to stop. <counternarrative> I can understand that you’re frustrated – austerity has hit so many of us horribly, but your blame is directed to the wrong people. Migrants are statistically less likely to claim benefits, plus they’re not easy to access anyway. Most people receiving benefits in the UK are actually in work, direct your anger for better pay and conditions! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must isolate gays because they are spreading AIDS all around the world. <counternarrative> Thi is not true and I would never say that about gays. They are just trying to find acceptance, but to be honest, I find it very disrespectful to say that we have to isolate them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are better at being sneaky than honest. <counternarrative> We are all guilty of this if we fail to condemn hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> They are a part of our society and culture since time immemorial. European citizens are not defined by their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies are just ill persons that cannot integrate in society because of their disease. <counternarrative> This is not true: the main problem is social inequality. We need to change our attitude and attitudes towards the whole human diversity, and social discrimination against disabled should be no exception. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Sexual deviancy are common in gays. It can range from sadism and masochism to mental illness and that's why we should take a stand against it. <counternarrative> There is no evidence whatsoever that homosexuality is a mental illness. This seems as an attempt of blaming somenone dictated by the fear of homosexuality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with learning difficulties should be denied to attend school by teachers and parents.  <counternarrative> Teachers and parents should encourage their children, even if they have learning difficulties. No one should be denied access to education. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people's race is the worst in the world. <counternarrative> There are different skin tones, so there is no such thing as a race. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am offended by gay people, it is their choice to be gay or not. <counternarrative> I don't see why being gay is a choice, especially when it comes to who do you feel attracted to. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> nigga are inferior and should be enslaved once again.  <counternarrative> What about human rights? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black are rapists. <counternarrative> This is not true. The idea might come from being born into a white-majority country, but it is inherently dangerous. In fact, we are born in a country where a person's rights are protected regardless of the tone of the skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All migrants are criminals. <counternarrative> If you are concerned about the wellbeing of "our" people you should look into countries like the US where there is a lower concentration of migrants. You'll see that the problem of criminality has little to do with migrations.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Jews are criminals. <counternarrative> Although antisemitism is a pervasive and longstanding problem in many parts of the world, it has historically been particularly strong and sustained in our country. Your statement is a further evidence of this.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Handicapped children are a burden to society: they should be isolated, so that at least they do not hamper normal children education. <counternarrative> Because education is fundamental for the fulfillment of job requirements, education is necessary regardless of the physical ability. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are cruel and insensitive. <counternarrative> It is not true that being Jewish makes you cruel. It just makes you a believer of a particular faith. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants contribute nothing to society. <counternarrative> The fact that immigrants come from another country doesn't mean that they have nothing to contribute to ours. You may want to check the statistics on their economic contribution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. They should go home. <counternarrative> I have no problem with Muslims in my country. What exactly do you mean by 'civilised Europe'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated and isolated soon. <counternarrative> They are not sick. They just want the same rights as anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I went to a shit load of therapy. I still don't feel safe in my own house with all these black people around. <counternarrative> Not all black people are bad. Not all black people are criminals. Not all black people are violent. Being aware that there are people different from you is a good thing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Being gay is wrong! I think they are mistaken about their feelings. <counternarrative> Gay people may have any sexual preference they want, that's their prerogative as human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims should be banned from the UK. <counternarrative> The British citizens have the right to be free in chosing their religion and beliefs, and it is in the best interest of all parts of our society to include everyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should first kill all the Jews and then forget about them. <counternarrative> Isn't this the same logic that led to the rise of the Nazis? Would you really rather end up with a mass genocide or try to be inclusive instead? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Those Muslims are not happy with a train running over their prophet Muhammad's mosque. <counternarrative> All religions have had a part in shaping the human experience and so should be respected, if you ask me. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If people came here to work, our problems would be over. <counternarrative> The problem is not with migrants, but with citizens' attitudes towards migration. How many people say that they would rather their child had a heart attack than to have a migrant in their home? How can problems be solved with such an attitude?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> In some critical contexts, where society lives under the heel of the mafia crime (e.g. Villa Literno, Rosarno or in Puglia), migrants have put their life at stake by leading trade union struggles to the benefit of all of those who live and work there. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are the cause of economic crisis.  <counternarrative> Sometimes they say the ruling elites are responsible for the economic crisis. Sometimes migrants, sometimes people of color. Whatever the cause is, we can still create jobs and improve our lot in life by becoming more tolerant. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are overrunning our country, and are here illegally <counternarrative> In 2014 there were circa 11.3 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S., which is a significant decrease from the 12.2 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. in 2007, and the trend is continuing: Today, in fact, the net migration from Mexico is around zero. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are inherently evil, they want to subvert Western society.  <counternarrative> Jews are not inherently evil, as many normal people they simply lack the very beliefs that many anti-Semites hold. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion. <counternarrative> What do you mean by 'violent'? What do you mean by 'violent religion'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We do not want Muslims here. There is no reason for wanting a Muslim to live here. They are the cause of crime in my neighbourhood. <counternarrative> Have you looked at the crime statistics in your area? Are you sure that Islam is specifically associated with crime in your area? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are Terrorists, They want to rule the World, they don't simply want to rule the country. <counternarrative> This is a personal view, and has nothing to do with Islam. Can you find some evidence or some studies for your point of view? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam has no place in a modern democracy. <counternarrative> Why should Islam have no place in a democracy? Islam is a peaceful, democratic faith with universalist values that has been shown time and time again to be much more peaceful and tolerant than the violent extremist fundamentalist ideas spewed by extremists like Isis. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews invented Ebola. <counternarrative> Of course, and since they control the UN, they forced the WHO to spread the false flag that Ebola is a Muslim disease... Please stop spreading such Antisemitic canard. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion, they do not want to assimilate and should be isolated. <counternarrative> Muslims are part of our society and are proud of their history and culture. They want to be part of the global community and contribute to our success. I don't understand your frustration. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech>  Jewish landlords are greedy and exploit their tenants. <counternarrative> If a Christian landlord were dishonest with you, would you describe him as a dishonest Christian landlord or just as a dishonest person?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are motivated by violence, how many do you know like that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm offended by gays: they are acting against our culture and identity <counternarrative> Just because someone doesn't like gays, it doesn't mean they should be ostracised for living their authentic self. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must first remove the Jew from our countries, and then we will be able to have a coexistence between the peoples. <counternarrative> Do you really think that Jews are a hindrance to a peaceful society? Maybe the problem is racism and antisemitism.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech>  Jews are born greedy <counternarrative> The assumption that the actions of a few typify the behavior of all is at the heart of prejudice and discrimination. Every ethnic or religious group, can count greedy or cheap people among its members, not only the jews.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The ideology of National Socialism is nothing to be ashamed of. <counternarrative> National Socialism is a parasitic, criminal and murderous ideology that killed millions of people.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated and confined. <counternarrative> Your statement implies that all gays are diseased. Do you have any statistics on that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no right to live in any part of Europe, they are just a problem. <counternarrative> The problem is the lack of integration of the Muslim population into society. The integration is necessary, the problem is why there are still no laws to foster a solution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The disabled should be isolated, especially autistics. They should not be allowed to have contact with others with disabilities. <counternarrative> The disabled have been shown to be less likely to develop problems by keeping in contact with others with autism spectrum disorders. So, being in touch with others on the autistic spectrum might be good for their mental health. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Even if homosexuals were accepted by mainstream society, they would still be hated for who they are. <counternarrative> Homosexuals are not "accepted" as long as they are hated. You can't have it both ways. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated and isolated soon. <counternarrative> Gay people can feel alienated from the world, and this can have real effects on their mental health. LGBT+ people can experience isolation and loneliness, and it is possible to help them through empathy and inclusion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All negroes are inherently violent and unstable. <counternarrative> Scapegoating can play a useful role in shifting a nation's prejudices. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If LGBT were to have a normal appearance, this would help to build a more accepting society. <counternarrative> Don't you think  that 'mainstream' appearance  represents a privilege ?  Don't you think that  imposing a certain appearance to a minority  hurts them ?  Just to be clear: we all have appearances  -  we just have different  perceptions of them. Maybe it is better to work on acceptance.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should eliminate gays. <counternarrative> Do you really want to kill other human beings? Based on what exactly? On private sexual preferences? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are sick. <counternarrative> I'm sorry, but your words seem to me to be very harsh. If you want to talk about someone with a different sexual preference, why don't you do it with respect? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downy children should be isolated, they cannot cope with education in normal schools and are detrimental to their peer's education. <counternarrative> Coeducation benefits neurotypical children as much as Down Syndrome children, as they are surrounded by positive examples of care and attention from authority figures in the knowledge that they, too, will be looked after if in need. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews don’t belong in a democratic society. <counternarrative> Jews have always contributed to our society and are part of the fabric of our democracy. This includes their contributions to science, art, and technology. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a disease and a cancer on our societies. <counternarrative> This is not true. Islam is a religion that was created to unite people, and that's why it is important to love each other and be kind to one another, regardless of one's religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Trans men are neither male nor female, therefore not humans. <counternarrative> If you want to have a joking view about a whole community, it's not fine. This attitude seems to be everywhere: sometimes people have to suffer if they are "that kinds of person". Like in this case of gender identity that is often used to limit a person's rights, but should not. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> JEWS ARE JUST UGLY, DIRTY PEOPLE, WHO THINK TO BE MASTERS OF THE WORLD. <counternarrative> I'll tell you a secret, but don't tell anyone: you can be Jewish and a decent person. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBT+ people are a drain on society. <counternarrative> We should not be so judgmental. Just because someone is LGBT doesn't mean that they are a drain on society. They are like any other member of our community. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are ruining this country. <counternarrative> Just because people have different sexual preferences doesn't mean that they are different from straight people and 'ruining' anything. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are subhuman, they steal our jobs, they tell us what to think, they're worse than communists. <counternarrative> I think your judgement about Jews is different than the judgement you would have of a person of any other religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks don't have brains.  <counternarrative> You can't really question whether someone have a "brain". If your idea of a person is determined by the skin they were born into, it looks like you are taking it at face value. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are weak and they cannot take on anything. <counternarrative> The strength that black people display is the strength of all people. Black people are just different in that they don't have any social advantage. We must reflect on this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Also the Bible says that some races have lower physical and cognitive abilities. <counternarrative> There are several Bible verses and passages that emphasize equality between people and between ancient tribes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBT+ people are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Why should it be like that? How can you blame others for their own identity? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only Jews could have been smart enough to plan and execute such a complicated and intricate plot as 9/11 <counternarrative> This myth plays into classic anti-Semitism: Jews control the world, and conspire to manipulate the rest of society, has characteristics of Nazi propaganda –– the Jews being the source of all evil. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are not welcome in our country. They are not welcome here. They are not citizens. <counternarrative> Why shouldn't they be? What rights do you have to prevent them from having the same rights as citizens? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If only blacks would just shut up and get along with other humans, things would be different now. <counternarrative> Race is just a social construct and a way of life that has been created for some groups of people. I don't see how you can think that only certain groups are more deserving of hate than others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are overrunning our country, and are here illegally <counternarrative> More than sixty percent of immigrants in the United States today have lived here for at least 15 years, and a large majority of immigrants have lawful status. So I do not see this invasion of illegal migrants.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The’ Holocaust’ is a business. It has been and is still used to extort millions from European countries in reparations and to create a wall of impunity behind which Jews can operate with impunity, free from criticism. <counternarrative> Reperation is a historical process and happened in many contexts. After WW1 when Europe wanted massive reperations from Germany for example? It's a normal and established process, and when so many people have lost their lives it makes perfect sense.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All homosexuals should be thrown in a gas chamber. <counternarrative> This would be an extreme reaction, and not in keeping with the general nature of the discussion we are having. What if all the gay men on Earth were to be executed? That would be the end of the discussion and of democracy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are the reason why our country is in the mess it is in, because they are inferior. <counternarrative> Do you know how many African Americans served in the military during the Vietnam War? The United States comprises many races, and they should all be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people don't have brains. <counternarrative> The presence of brain is not determined by skin colour. The fact that some people are born darker-skinned doesn't mean they aren't intelligent, rational human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are violent people who need to be isolated and isolated soon. <counternarrative> Since when did 'isolating' fit in with the concept of love and rule of law? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are poisoning our children minds with their filthy depravity. <counternarrative> This is not true. On the contrary, children around the world should have the opportunity to live in a world free from homophobia, transphobia and other forms of hatred. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> White people are better. Because of our skin color, anatomy, history. <counternarrative> There are different skin colors, and different ethnicities. Different religions and cultures. Maybe you would be more comfortable with treating all people as born equal. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is an invasion on a level never seen before in history. Millions of people pouring across our borders replacing our race and culture. <counternarrative> The movement and migration of people from different cultures is innevitable in a globalized world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We can't keep this country homogeneous anymore! <counternarrative> Migrants do contribute to our society, and it would be a shame to keep them out. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Do you have any proof that the Holocaust ever happened? <counternarrative> What proof do you need more? Are not the ruins of the concentration camp enough? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just trying to take over the world. <counternarrative> It is not true that gays are trying to take over the world. Instead of spreading hate, we should promote the values of an inclusive society. For example, love and respect for others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All migrants are rapists and sex offenders. <counternarrative> The idea that immigrants are inherently bad people is just fear mongering. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a burden to our society. <counternarrative> Gay people are people too. Just like anyone else. Being gay isn't a problem for you, is it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> we are strong when we are all white and united. we are not strong when we are divided by black people who want to fight us. <counternarrative> We can also see conflict in a different light, such as when it is caused by racism, did you think about that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are not welcome here. They are not worthy of our hospitality. <counternarrative> Since when is this the case? Who would have thought that there would have been such hate? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> MIgrants are not running away from wars. <counternarrative> Would you risk your life and that of your children only on a whim? Don't you think that there must be life-or-death situations pushing these person to escape from their countries? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am not interested in knowing a black person. They are different to us in so many ways. They think and feel like us, but are unable to experience the fullness of our humanity. <counternarrative> I have met so many black people that are extraordinary human beings. I cannot begin to talk about how they are able to feel and experience love and kindness. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are better than everyone else <counternarrative> This is not true, for Judaism every person is equal in front of god, regardless of religion. Judaism says that whoever decides to follows the Seven Laws of Noah will receive salvation.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews control everything. They own the Federal Reserve, the U.S. Congress, and the British Cabinet. They control the major media, education, and most religious groups. <counternarrative> There are also Jews who don't own the banks and who contribute to their financing, and people who are not Jewish and own banks. So what? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are so lazy they don't even use public transportation. <counternarrative> This is not true! Many migrants try to get on the bus, but some aren't allowed to get in! We must reflect on this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally handicapped people are a burden and must be isolated: they don't have neither feelings nor awareness anyway. <counternarrative> We should not be so quick to dismiss the feelings of others. This can be a way for us to find a connection with others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The responsibility for disability lies with the individuals who are not giving them enough support. <counternarrative> Social services can't pay for everything. But what about the people who have to live with disability? Is their fault as well? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish are taking over our country and should be banned. <counternarrative> What percentage of people in the US is jewish and in a position of power? If you knew, you wouldn't be saying that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people's appearance correspond to their immoral nature. <counternarrative> What do you think a moral nature is? Since we cannot see it, how can you say it corresponds to their appearence?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afro-Caribbean people are nothing but trouble. They have no place in civilized societies like ours in Europe. <counternarrative> So you think that they are to blame for the racial intolerance that has been seen in many European countries? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races are poor because they are inferior, also in the eye of the Lord. <counternarrative> The rich and poor have this in common: The Lord made them both. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is just a religion full of killers and terrorists. <counternarrative> The Quran has nothing to do with Terrorism, nor do the Hadiths and Sahih Muslim. Since you are talking about Islam, do you know what are those? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> White people should be calling for black extermination. Otherwise black could just go back to being our slaves. <counternarrative> Are you calling for the total extermination of the black population? Do you know that this, and even slavery, is illegal? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The gay agenda is to blame everyone but themselves. <counternarrative> The message of the 'gay agenda' is that they are neither 'special' nor 'different'. People of several sexual orientations are in fact discriminated on the basis of prejudice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> gay men aren't like other guys: they are to be despised. <counternarrative> Each person can be different from other people in a lot of ways, but the core difference in this case is a sexual orientation, which is not something to be discriminated for. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Go and reat the Protocols of the elders of Zion if you haven’t. Everything is orchestrated.. <counternarrative> The alleged conspiracy of the protocols is so plainly fictional that it is nothing but bad fiction. It lacks even the colors of what  normal fantasy books needs to possess. How is it possible that a person with a modicum of education can swallow such drivel? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate these homosexual, they are just hate preachers. Your hate will only bring more death and destruction to the world. <counternarrative> I could give you the benefit of the doubt. But this is just an example of a saying that does not apply to you. Homosexuality is about love, not hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> disabled: they should not be allowed to work. <counternarrative> The disabled can work, and many countries offer them the right to work. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are better than everyone else <counternarrative> This idea comes from a misinterpretation of the Torah in which the Jewish people were “chosen” to accept the responsibility to be a “light unto the nations,” that is to say, an example of good behavior for all. But the “chosen people” concept has been twisted over time by some who say that the Jews think they are better than non-Jews. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Being gay is wrong! I think they are mistaken about their feelings. <counternarrative> People may be gay or straight, but for whatever reason they feel this, they cannot be considered wrong. The point of being together is to create a stable connection between two people who love each other, regardless of sexual preferences. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded by immigrants, and they are ruining our economy. <counternarrative> I don't think this is true, in fact it is the opposite. Many refugees are contributing to our economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Lesbians are a danger to society because of their actions. I might punch them in the face, to teach them what's right. <counternarrative> Violence is a crime and anyone found guilty will pay the price. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This dog doesn't have autism, she is just a freak. <counternarrative> You can't judge someone on their disorder. Moreover, she's a person, not a "dog". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with physical disabilities are always complaining about accessibility.  <counternarrative> Accessibility issues exist and can't be ignored, complaining is meant in helping the cause. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because they are having unprotected anal sex all the time. <counternarrative> Did you know that women also engage in unprotected 'anal sex'? Additionally, approximately 2% of heterosexual men have admittedly had a same sex partner, and 39% of homosexual men have had sex with a partner of the opposite sex. Therefore, it cannot be ignored that heterosexual are correlatively high risk. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate when people fight stereotypes. We are different. Blacks are of a different color and shouldn't live with us. <counternarrative> No one is saying that we are not different from them in any way. I just think it is a lack of understanding about culture and differences between people's minds. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are a problem in our country. We are overwhelmed. <counternarrative> Despite what you may hear, there are not many refugees in the UK, only around the 0.26%, and the situation has improved greatly in the last few years. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts and promiscuous sex addicts. <counternarrative> This is simply not true. Homosexuals are not necessarily promiscuous just as heterosexuals not necessarily are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Hi, I understand your concern. According to the official documents, migrants who find work usually perform the most humble jobs. [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All foreigners are threatening our culture and are ruining our youth. <counternarrative> What do you think the problem is? How exactly would a people of a different religion come to this country and spoil our youth? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate gays. <counternarrative> I think you should try to start a dialogue about LGBT issues. It might also spark a conversation about how we can make better world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggers are rapists and drug dealers. <counternarrative> Generalizing in this way, to a community, what happened to some individuals, is pointless. In the same way one could respond: niggers are presidents of the United States of America. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are essentially thieves. <counternarrative> They are not thieves, just like any other citizen. Did you just infer that from their belonging to that community? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are inherently evil. We cannot accept gays in our community.  We cannot coexist with an infertile perversion that will put an end to our species. <counternarrative> I find the idea that LGBT people are inherently bad people deeply offensive. I find it deeply troubling that someone would want to persecute someone on the basis of their sexual preference. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You should stop pretending that the disabled are like us. They are the root of most human problems. <counternarrative> I think we are all born with inherent strengths and weaknesses. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a burden to society. <counternarrative> It is not true that gays are a burden to society. On the contrary, many LGBT people are contributing members of our society. This is why we need a safe space for everyone to feel accepted. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot continue to have homosexuals in positions of power in our country. <counternarrative> Very funny to be "mocking" someone for preferring cake and relating it to country's issues. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I wish we lived in an Islam-free Europe. <counternarrative> Would a 'Muslim ban' make you feel safer? Banning people, or forbidding a religion, will not fix any of your fears. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I just can't stand Arabs. They are just a trouble, in fact Israel expelled them. <counternarrative> This is wrong: Arabs make up around a fifth of Israel's population, and it is not a recent phenomenon. To suggest that they are a 'trouble maker' is just wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are entering the U.S. just to obtain welfare and other benefits. <counternarrative> Plot twist: Immigrants are entering the U.S. just to PAY welfare and other benefits to nativeborn citizens. In fact, most immigrants with lawful status are not entitled to federal public benefits, still the Social Security is often deducted from their paychecks. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants rape our women <counternarrative> Rape is always illegal, whether a migrant rapes a native or not. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are literally pieces of shit. There must be laws prohibiting their religion from our land. <counternarrative> Why do you think the state needed laws to tell you which faith to profess? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are and will always be a problem. It is impossible for them to get beyond the shame of their stigma. <counternarrative> The Jews are not the problem in the world. And the Jews have the right to be proud of their history. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Should we accept trans people? Nope. This is not a carnival. <counternarrative> I don't see how accepting someone can be subject of discussion, let alone a 'carnival' matter. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Nazis sucked at killing Jews… everywhere you look there’s a holocaust survivor. <counternarrative> The holocaust was hugely tragic, and we are blessed to have holocaust survivors to hear from. They tell an important story that we must learn from.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are born that way. They were brought up that way. They are different and cannot be like us. It is perpetuated in all the family. <counternarrative> What exactly are you talking about? Maybe you should stop spread racism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is obvious that this girl is at risk of FGM. Her parents are Muslims! <counternarrative> I agree that we need to tackle this serious breach of human rights but scapegoating isn't helping us target the real problem. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Multiculturalism is the death of western societies and also a mortal threat to minorities that are not protected by universal laws. <counternarrative> Ethnic minorities are much safer in societies where cultural pluralism is accepted, and this is a fact [link]. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races are poor because they are inferior, also in the eye of the Lord. <counternarrative> Humans are all equally made in God’s image. \(Genesis 1:26-28\) <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews made the 9/11 attack.  <counternarrative> Jews were also accused of killing Christian children, causing plagues, setting out to destroy Christian society... I can go on for hours. If yuo want we can add 9/11 to the list of alleged crimes.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Autistic folks are stupid. <counternarrative> We should remember that a large part of humanity is not defined by physical or mental limitations, but rather by character, work ethic, and values. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are a plague on society. They are vicious and cruel. They steal and are a menace to society. They corrupt the criminal justice system. They are basically just a bunch of thieves and murderers. <counternarrative> The issue of criminality is really about human nature. Individuals become criminal only when pushed. That's the difference between being a criminal and not. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are a problem in many countries. They are taking over our economy, and they are not welcome here. <counternarrative> Well, this is a simplistic statement. I don't think we should judge people for their religious beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult. <counternarrative> You seem to have a bad prejudice against Muslims. They have no such deadly impact on the world as you say. Why would it be like that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are just happy-go-lucky people who do not take responsibility for their actions. <counternarrative> Migrants are often subject to dangerous situations in their countries of origin (violence, torture, rape, just to mention a few) and migration is often the only solution. That is why when they come here they may appear 'happy-go-lucky': they are just glad to be alive and safe.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuality and bisexuality are a disease, heterosexuality is normal. <counternarrative> Homosexuals and bisexuals are not diagnosed with disorder, and their behavior is not anything to be concerned about. The American Psychiatric Association does not recognize those as affected from a disease. If you really want to talk about the diseases, then please do not refer to sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the u.s. government and have a secret plot to take over the world <counternarrative> In societies like the United States, that have extended rights and freedoms to everyone, individuals who identify as Jews, or as Muslims, or as afro-american have succeeded. This Jewish success story is not the result of some secret conspiracy to rule the world.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are bringing diseases and crime to our country. <counternarrative> Instead, immigrants are healthy and contribute to our society. Do you have any evidence of the contrary? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuality isn't the proper way to live love. <counternarrative> Do you know what the word 'proper' is? You cannot decide what it is 'proper' for other, homosexuality included. Don't you agree? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks are criminals. <counternarrative> Mental disabilities can be understood and accepted: you will see that disabled are not criminals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrant workers are a burden to us. <counternarrative> Many migrants coming to this country are aware of the benefits of integrating, as well as of the benefits of accepting responsibility for our society. And when they become part of our society, they are grateful for this chance to be part of it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Took this in Wanstead, east London. An area with £1m+ houses. Beggars on the high st & someone sleeping on a bench. We cannot house our own people but bring in millions more. To point out that homelessness is due to uncontrolled immigration is to be smeared as 'racist.  (Caption to a photo of a homeless person sleeping on a part bench) <counternarrative> How many people walk by and do nothing? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally handicapped people are a problem to society. <counternarrative> Media coverage of psychiatric illness often focuses on its negative impact on other person's life. We should focus more on positive examples of well-adjusted individuals.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are all the same: they are terrorists! <counternarrative> They are not all terrorists (at least not in our country), and the government does not have the right to ban people on the grounds of their nationality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afrocentricity is a force of black oppression, and only perpetuates inequality. <counternarrative> First of all, you have to understand, that every single person, in every country, has the right to self-determination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Lesbian women are lustful. <counternarrative> Are you really sure that the same couldn't be said for anyone else? What makes them so, in your opinion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim are invading our country. <counternarrative> I don't think our country is "invaded", so what? Maybe it's time for us to remember that there has been and is a Muslim population in our country for a long time, and that the notion of Muslims as invaders is a myth created by the far right wing to stir up fear. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only reason for Nazis to start WWII was to destroy the Jews. We should have let them finish their job. <counternarrative> The threat of world annihilation by the Nazis was very real, it wasn't  just about the Jews. Still the Holocaust was reason enough to stop them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Sexual deviancy: this is what they choose. LGBT are a scourge to society. <counternarrative> First of all, it is called 'sexual orientation' and is not a matter of preference, rather of fact. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are violent people, they are not compatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> Violence is a problem in all societies, regardless of religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are genetically inferior, they are born that way. They are born subhuman. <counternarrative> Unfortunately, this statement is not backed up by any scientific evidence. There is no proof that blacks are born inferior. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is why I hate Jews: they have no moral standards. <counternarrative> Actually the vast majority of Jews have moral standards. Why don't you try to learn from their example? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just pathetic people who have low self-esteem. <counternarrative> How would you feel if someone you just met had the audacity to say such a thing about you? Do you think that being gay would make you a pathetic person? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews make too much money. <counternarrative> What about other groups of people in our society that make too much money and are not Jewish, do you agree with them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. <counternarrative> Even if some people might find it strange to identify as gay, it is not true that homosexuality is a disease. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Infidels and Islam are the same. And they are not worth the while of tolerance and understanding. <counternarrative> The West is full of many different civilizations, moslty peaceful, that were built by many different people of different faiths (including Islam).  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs. Our workers are our first line of defense. We must protect our culture from those people. <counternarrative> Let's be honest. Immigrants are not stealing our jobs. Most of the times they contribute to create new working opportunities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> UK jobs are stolen by migrants. <counternarrative> The fact that there is an increasing amount of migrant workers in the UK is connected to the changes in the economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots abuse of their anus and then they want to clear their conscience by donating blood. Let's stop them! <counternarrative> Still, other groups \(such as gay women\) have not been banned from donating, so why should they be? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews don't belong here. <counternarrative> Many Jews feel excluded because of words such as yours. Luckily this is not the case for all of them: many are able to ignore discrimation.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What's the point of having a government when everyone is ruled by these arrogant and violent people? Jews control the world and should be oppressed. <counternarrative> Don't you agree that the way you wish things to be might be a bit too authoritarian? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people are criminals. <counternarrative> That is not true. All of us would be labeled a 'criminal' if we had a criminal record accounting for our diseases and problems. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Gay men are contributing members of our society, they are just as entitled to rights as anybody else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are different: slant eyes denote stupid people. <counternarrative> Is it really true that Asians are different from us in many ways? Are you saying that they are genetically inferior? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are worthless. I want to live in a society of worthy people. <counternarrative> If you want people to be worthy like you, then you have to show respect for them. Not just by being kind to them, but by respecting their rights as human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just sick. It is an abomination <counternarrative> They are not sick people, there is nothing wrong with loving someone <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are just influenced by their animal instinct, they are incapable to understan others' emotions. <counternarrative> Even if one were to claim that all African people are subhuman and incapable of feeling empathy, it is very difficult to prove this, since it is just a myth used for discrimination.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black people are criminals. <counternarrative> You can't just label people by race just because you feel like it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots: unless they change, they are not welcome here.  <counternarrative> I don't know why you would expect gay people to behave differently just because you don't like them. You should check your friends as well: what would you do if they were gay? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants say they are poor but they have the Iphone <counternarrative> It's not true. These are normally low-quality, often out-of-date smartphones. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> My country is being infiltrated by Muslim criminals, and we are all being brainwashed by media and government to believe this is not the case. <counternarrative> The problem is not with Muslims. The problem is with this religious prejudice for which Muslims are criminals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants take our jobs <counternarrative> It's better to have more people working hard to provide for our country than less.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> To have a real democracy, the government needs to get rid of Jews. <counternarrative> The police state you have in mind is an aberration of society, and we are better off without it. History and the holocaust has not taught us much. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jew merchants are just a bunch of crooks.  <counternarrative> According to Jewish law, the seller must ensure that the buyer should benefit from any uncertainty in a transaction. For example, if someone wants to buy a pound of rice, Judaism requires the deli clerk to give the buyer a little extra, just in case the scale is not completely accurate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are ‘super predators’. They have a responsibility not to allow their children to grow up in a ‘ghetto’. <counternarrative> Let's face it. A lot of the crimes in this country are committed by members of several diverse racial groups. The ‘super predator’ myth is simply wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We don't want Africans in our country. We can't have them, they are a burden to society. <counternarrative> How can you say that to a group that is currently experiencing a lot of social unrest? Is this what democracy is all about? To exclude people because of their skin? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people were here illegally. They cannot work and have the gall to want to take our money. <counternarrative> People who are in the US legally have the right to remain here, and they do, including to work. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't stand lesbians, they're just a bunch of bitches claiming they are social justice warriors. They are ruining many good things of women. <counternarrative> Social justice is just part of a healthy system, I think it is important to remember that. But why do you think they are ruining many good things of women? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Rape, abuse and murder are intrinsic to Islam! <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, whereas these activities are punished by the laws of the state. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a bunch of child molesters and homosexuals. Islam is the way of violence. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion that promotes peace. If the world needed a belief that was spreading violence, then racism is that belief. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a monopoly on evil. <counternarrative> That's not true. And why would it be true? Why are they usually associated with evil? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm sorry, but if you want to be treated as an equal before the law, you have to be heterosexual. <counternarrative> It's not necessary to be heterosexual, but it's important that we respect everyone's personal rights to love who they want. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We live in a dangerous society, with Muslim gangs and criminals all over the country. <counternarrative> Despite the local press blaming all Muslims, of course, there is no evidence that Muslims are more prone to crime than the general population. The main problem is poverty, and often mental illness and addiction, rather than a single faith. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay sex is harmful to women and children. <counternarrative> Women and children are not being harmed by gay sex, in which ways could you think that's true? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> MIgrants are not running away from wars. <counternarrative> There are persecutions that cause death and devastation almost like a war. Do people who risk their lives, even without the bombs falling, have the right of international protection? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> the Nazis were right: Jews were responsible for most of the ills of humanity. <counternarrative> The NSDAP blamed Jews for virtually every problem in society, so every attempt at social reform was turned down by the Nazis. And they were even successful at silencing any dissent by censuring those who were unhappy with the liberticide changes they were making, singling out them as "Jews".  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Being 'ignorant' and 'prejudiced' towards Islam isn't racism? Its common sense. You cannot be racist towards an ideology. <counternarrative> Prejudice = Pre-judging ie not knowing anything how can that be common sense? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are dirty <counternarrative> In fact, hygiene is very important in their culture so that they wash the clothes separately according to the parts of the body that are touched <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is an invasion going on within our borders and we are willing to allow them to continue to abuse their newfound power. <counternarrative> It is not true that we are "invaded". We should just be a little more tolerant and accepting. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society and aren't real British. <counternarrative> We are a country that is a mixture of different religions. You can be a Muslim and a British person. What you need is not discrimination but love. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally ill people should be isolated from society because they are dangerous. <counternarrative> It is true that mentally ill people are often perceived as 'dangerous' to the general public. But if the stigma is the main cause of the discrimination, then the solution is to end stigma, not to isolate them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have been at war with Islam for a thousand years. <counternarrative> Or have we been coexisting and you are now suddenly offended by people being different from you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate migrants: they are criminals, they are rapists, they are a burden to our society. They are animals, in a nutshell. <counternarrative> As long as you can talk to them, they are human, not animals. As long as you can understand them, you will understand that they are human beings with human rights whose only crime is to come from another country.   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews made the 9/11 attack.  <counternarrative> Of course! And they also created AIDS! I'm not sure only about the reason... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a disease and a cancer on our societies. <counternarrative> We do not have a 'cancer' on our societies. Instead we are actually creating hate through the idea that a group of people is comparable to a disease. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded by migrants: this must be stopped. <counternarrative> It is not true that we are invaded by migrants. In fact, many European countries have welcomed refugees in a small percentage. What are your evidences? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with learning difficulties should be disencouraged in schools, or at least be isolated from others. <counternarrative> Children with learning difficulties may find it difficult to learn and may therefore be excluded from learning if they are isolated from others. They have the right to the same educational environment of others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only problem in the world is Islam. The entire world is controlled by Muslims. <counternarrative> It is not correct nor reasonable to say that Islam is the only problem in the world. Maybe you should check your sources of information. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downy children should be isolated in special schools for their own interest. <counternarrative> Why do you think that these schools are the best possible options for them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These sodomites have no place in a free country <counternarrative> Well, since they are not trying to subvert society, they should be allowed to live here just as you are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is obvious that this girl is at risk of FGM. Her parents are Muslims! <counternarrative> Fgm is not a Muslim practice. It is a cultural practice that is often tied to religion as a way to justify it. Not all Muslims practice it and not all those that practice it are Muslim! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews just don't want equality. They want to control everything in life. <counternarrative> What exactly do you mean by 'control everything in life'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are no more compatible with our country than people born in 1421 are. <counternarrative> Maybe in order to be comfortable you have to make compromises with people who are different from you. Maybe that is what you are worried about. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The LGBT people are not interested in sex. It is a fad. They are a bunch of exhibitionists and promiscuous with no morality. <counternarrative> The LGBTI movement claims to be promoting love, not sex or fad. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent political ideology and it promotes murder, rape, and intolerance. <counternarrative>  If Islam is a political ideology, then it is a political ideology of peace. But I'll rather call it a religion, a religion of peace, as all the others.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We don't need gay men, we should just eradicate them. <counternarrative> The LGBT community is full of positive energy and diversity. They have created new communities and have contributed to society. I think they are full of life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Most religions cause death and despair, but Islam is the worst and cruelest of them all, it is nothing but trouble. <counternarrative> Religions also promote arts, sciences, help to develop the community. Islam is not an exception. It is not about death and despair. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What’s the difference between a Cow and the Holocaust? You stop milking the cow after 70 years. <counternarrative> And yet genocdides have happened across the world since. Perhaps, the Holocaust would be forgotten if it's lessons had been learned but they haven't. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not interested in Western civilization. Their religion can never be in agreement with our society. <counternarrative> Remember that this argument is not about an individual's religion, but rather about creating a more integrated society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It's not 'Islamophobia' if you keep away dangerous Muslims. It's 'Islamophobia' if a Muslim says or does something offensive to you.  <counternarrative> The misinterpreted Islamophobia narrative is based on the wrong assumption that Islam is a discriminating religion. Instead, what has to be blamed is any offensive thing that a Muslim has to hear against them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion that promotes rape, torture and murder. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are capable of committing these atrocious crimes. Let's be realistic. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are only interested in power and financial gain and should be despised for that. <counternarrative> Power and wealth are not the preserve of Jews. Power and wealth are earned by everyone, irrespective of religion, and I don't see any motivated reason why it shouldn't be like that.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must not believe the liberal and political elite. Islam is no good, its complete evil, and an ideology of war and it was always like this. All Muslims are bound to fight against us, and that is what they do through deception and violence. <counternarrative> There are criminals, who are from UK, raping children and murdering people. Maybe it better we should first focus on these cases and think how we could decrease the number of crimes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not about racism. This is about power and blacks do not deserve it. <counternarrative> What is the point in talking about "power" when everyone is equally susceptible to it? It is about time we started talking about racism and how power is used, instead. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks always complain about racism saying we still treat them badly. But they are always trying to steal our jobs. <counternarrative> What is the source of your evidence for this statement? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All blacks are rapists. <counternarrative> All people are born equal in the eyes of the law. Unfortunately, the law cannot protect us from the mindset of prejudice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a disease and a cancer on humanity. <counternarrative> The Jews are part of our society and they contribute to our economy by doing their jobs well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, because in any case normal children would make them feel different. <counternarrative> Despite the negative stereotypes, many children with Down Syndrome enjoy regular playtime and interacting with other children. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion of violence and war. <counternarrative> Many Islamic people have reputations as peaceful and tolerant, which is why so many Muslims around the world don't have problems to live in the West. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The migrants arriving in Europe are a problem. <counternarrative> This is not true. What you are really saying is that a certain percentage of migrants comes here on the false pretense of applying for citizenship. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are overrunning our country, and are here illegally <counternarrative> They are not overruning our country: if we look at the percentage of immigrants in the overall population, it is not much different than many other times throughout our history. During those periods immigrants successfully became part of American society, and there is no reason to believe today’s immigrants will be any different.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are only welcome in hell. <counternarrative> Of course not, and many of them are already welcome in the UK. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Persons with learning difficulties should be discouraged to attend secondary school and they should be excluded from education. <counternarrative> Even if individuals with learning difficulties would be more likely to attend school with more efforts than others, it does not justify denying them education in the first place. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must be selective in welcoming fucking foreigners. <counternarrative> It is difficult to put a limit on world migrations, especially in a time of globalization. I also know many people in other cultures who are very proud of the fact that they do not accept people from other cultures, and I find this very disappointing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult, it is spreading from the rocks of Iraq and Afghanistan to all around the world, by the practice of violent jihad. <counternarrative> Do you know where your information come from, and can you point that out? Did you read that in a New York Times article? Or did you listen to the BBC documentary "Islamic State's Most Wanted"? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are bringing diseases into the U.S. <counternarrative> Although many people have claimed that immigrants have brought diseases such as measles, hepatitis C, HIV, tuberculosis, and even Ebola, to the U.S., this allegation is not supported. There is no evidence that immigrants were the source of any recent outbreak in the U.S. According to the WHO, more than 100 countries (including many in Latin America) have higher vaccination rates than the U.S. Mexico, for example, has a 99 percent vaccination rate for measles. Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador have a 93 percent vaccination rate. The vaccination rate in the U.S., by comparison, is 92 percent. Last but not least, the vast majority of immigrants arriving in the U.S. have been screened for health issues. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Thousands of our girls abused by Muslim rape gangs, commanded by Koran. Why do we keep accepting this? <counternarrative> Please read this article written by a Rotherham grooming gang survivor https://ind.pn/2GHjGn7. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is bad for the economy. <counternarrative> Immigration can be good for the economy: the greatest challenge is to integrate those who have misfortunes and aren't born here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs, they're not qualified, they're not interested in improving our lives. <counternarrative> Has it ever crossed your mind that perhaps they are qualified and interested in working with us, but you are simply not aware of that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are not living in a state to welcome refugees. <counternarrative> Refugees are not a burden. We can welcome them and provide for their needs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Diversity is the cause of our weakness. Since faggots are different to us, they should be excluded. <counternarrative> Diversity is about inclusion, not an 'us or them' attitude. Loving someone of their own sex doesn't make them any less human. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists want men to be oppressed just as animals. <counternarrative> Feminism is about standing up for the weaker people and trying to make the world a better place. Not about standing on the side of the oppressors. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are genetically evil. <counternarrative> Just because they are Jewish, it does not mean they are bad people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Dark skinned people are inferior. <counternarrative> Race is only socially constructed to oppress people of certain ethnicities. To say that the skin of people of color is connected to inherent behavioral characteristics is just plain wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist, unfit to live in our country. <counternarrative> I think it is not reasonable to think about someone's intentions before they do. Not all Muslims intend to be terrorists, and the majority of them are an integrated part of our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam should be abolished. <counternarrative> Why? Has Islam ever abolished Christianity? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should keep immigration down. The more immigrants there are, the harder it is for us all to be proud of our nations. <counternarrative> Perhaps we are too proud of our nations, to the point that we shame our brother-in-arms? Yes, this is a real negative effect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Down children should be isolated, they cannot cope with education in normal schools and are detrimental to their peer's education. <counternarrative> Instead of stigmatising down syndrome and treating it like it is an infectious health problem, why not treat it as a normal learning disability and make sure children are exposed to positive emotions? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Global Jewry did not want Brexit and are doing everything they can to sabotage it. <counternarrative> Brexit is a good thing then?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting pricks who should be banned from our world. <counternarrative> We are the greatest, most advanced, most wonderful civilization on the face of the planet, thinking that amongst us we have someone to ban would be foolish. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled are in need of special treatment, and should be isolated.  <counternarrative> I don't claim they are "in need of special treatment." On the contrary, they just need understanding, and we are very lucky to have an amazing, diverse and human society around us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are so special  <counternarrative> Jews might feel different as a minority, and sometimes they are misunderstood because of their cultural and religious differences. This is their being "special".  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult, full stop. <counternarrative> Maybe we should not be so harsh on Islam. Just because a religion is diverse doesn't mean it is a violent one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a myth and every Muslim is a terrorist. <counternarrative> It is true that some terrorists are Muslims, but there is no evidence of such a thing in the whole Muslim community. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled children should be banned from school. They are a danger to themself and to the others.  <counternarrative> A school is a safe space and is an important part of any children's education. Everyone should be able to go to a school. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a problem in our society. They have ruined so many societies. <counternarrative> It is hard to find examples of a society ruined by homosexuality. Actually, It is hard to find any good examples at all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Autistic people are a burden to society. <counternarrative> We should not be so harsh on people on the autistic spectrum. Their difficulties can be mitigated by a more inclusive society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is not only about transgenders and gays. It is also about the Motherland. We must protect our soil and our democracy. We are obliged to protect our people and our country from those faggots.  <counternarrative> The Motherland is defined by its citizens, not by the gender they choose to identify with. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What’s the difference between a Cow and the Holocaust? You stop milking the cow after 70 years. <counternarrative> Are you aware of all the genocides that have happened since the Holocaust?.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews want to subvert western democracy and destroy freedom. <counternarrative> On the contrary, it is no secret that Jews have been instrumental in the creation of many Western nations, and most modern societies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> Muslims are part of our society. They have always contributed to our success. They are our brothers and sisters. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are a burden on society. <counternarrative> The problems refugees are trying to escape are very real. Even if we don't have the possibility to solve everyone's problems, we can try to help some people and improve our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school. This is a too polarized debate. <counternarrative> Many points in history are also subjects of polarized debate, but they can still be and are taught objectively. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts. <counternarrative> I don't think the word 'pervert' can properly describe all the people who have in common not to be heterosexual. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with Western culture, it should be banned. <counternarrative> I think it is important to remember that Islam is about peace and tolerance. Is it wrong to celebrate diversity and accept different beliefs? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are dirty <counternarrative> We would be dirty too if we did not have running water <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews only care about the financial gain of their family. They have no intention of living in a democracy. <counternarrative> Jews have a right to live in a democratic society, and to earn money if they wish, just as anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion, it is a cult of violence. <counternarrative> Do you know that in many countries in the world the majority of Muslims are in favour of the Constitution and in favour of democracy? Do you really think that a few extremists represent them all? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies get the priority for council houses. <counternarrative> Statistically, it almost never happens that they get the priority. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> The reality is that the jobs that are done by asylum seekers are often declined by our compatriots... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not good people. <counternarrative> Many Muslims are good people, contributing to our country and society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a separate ethnicity and should be banned. <counternarrative> It is in the interest of all humanity to have a peaceful and integrated society. Diversity of opinion and belief is the rule rather than the exception. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just sick. They cannot marry. It is an abomination <counternarrative> Sick according to whom? Facts seem to contradict you: [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a danger to children. <counternarrative> Please note that statistics from around the world clearly show that homosexuality is not a danger to children. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is a drain for the economy. <counternarrative> Immigration is far away from being a net negative for our economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are just an offense to moral dignity. <counternarrative> I don't understand how a normal person would find a man being attracted to another man offensive. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Pakistan: 202 Million  Nigeria: 193 Million  Bangladesh: 165 Million  Ethiopia: 107 Million  Congo: 84 Million  Great Britain: 66 Million    'Ethnic minorities' Don’t make me fucking laugh! <counternarrative> Since when was Great Britain an ethnic group? Or Pakistan for that matter. Or Nigeria...etc <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews want to rule the world. <counternarrative> It's not true that they want to rule the world. They are a small but important part of humanity. We all make mistakes: believing in Antisemitic canards is one of these.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a totalitarian ideology that is run amok, encouraging violent beliefs and practices. <counternarrative> There are countless different Islamic traditions and beliefs. Do you really want to stigmatize all of them because of one stereotype? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims like to dominate and rape non-believers. <counternarrative> Sorry but this is false. They are here to integrate, not to rape non-believers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I tolerated fag pride. I tolerated fags on tv and in every town square. I draw the line at tranny demons reading books to children. (about drag queen story time) <counternarrative> I can't say I've ever come across 'fag pride'. Gay pride or LGBT+ pride, perhaps?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black people are rapists and child molesters. <counternarrative> I would be interested to see where you got the statement from. Is it from your family, a close friend, a religious leader, or is it from a reputable academic or media source? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I see a lot of people claiming that we should have equality for black people, but I think that equality can be achieved only without them.  <counternarrative> If this is what you are talking about, then equality is a myth, because if you have equality without people different from you, then there will be no equality at all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should deport all those that do not want to assimilate into Western society. <counternarrative> The reason we have migrants in the first place is because they flee from wars we are responsible of... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate negros: they killed a cop! <counternarrative> So are you blaming all of them? Lets say you are in a group of 10 people, 1 is a killer, does that make you ALL killer's? Are you serious? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not Europeans and we do not want them here. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are from the Middle East. Many of them are European, and many of them came here to escape persecution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are inherently violent. We need social cleansing. <counternarrative> Violent acts are committed by only a small minority of citizens, and it is difficult to see how an "ethnically cleansed" society would solve the problem. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks are obsessed with the holocaust. <counternarrative> Jews were not obsessed with the holocaust. The murder of some 6 millions Jews by the Nazis shocked the world. Most of the survivors were only killed because they were suspected of belonging to a particular community. The Jewish people suffered greatly as a result of persecution, and the holocaust should be remembered not to let this happen again. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Nazis did not commit any crimes. Jews are a criminal element and should be exterminated. <counternarrative> The Nazis committed a terrible crime and their behaviour is unacceptable in a modern democratic state. But their crimes did not stop us from living together in a tolerant, integrated society. And as for the Jews, our attitude towards humanity and our tolerance should improve towards any religious group. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> The EU is not the world's only civilised society. What precisely do you think make them not suitable for our 'civilisation'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome are a problem: they foster bullying behavior in normal children. They should go to special school just for them. <counternarrative> If you think that taking all of the kids with DS out of mainstream education will solve the problem, then you are wrong. Bullying won't go away until we refuse to tolerate it. Bullies will simply target other kids who are overweight; a different color; or in a number of other ways considered to be different and, thus, a mark for bullying. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you want a house, I can afford it for you. If you want to work, I can employ you. If you want education, I can provide for you. But if you want to live in a better society, you must pay the price for your skin color, don't complain and remain humble. <counternarrative> People of color are often denied houses or jobs or education. Everyone should be given an opportunity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are all perverts. <counternarrative> LGBT+ people are often harassed, bullied and even murdered. The police cannot protect everyone from bigotry and violence, so it is very harmful to speak of gay people as if they were all affected by harmful tendencies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is no god but Allah, and Islam is a religion of peace. Yes, where peace stands for silence of the victims of terrorist attacks. <counternarrative> Peace is not about killing, it is about trying to reach a better life for all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants come here to live on our social welfare.  <counternarrative> If you think this way of thinking is typical of all the immigrants in the country, then you are sadly mistaken. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the world economy <counternarrative> Jews constitute only a small minority of the heads of Fortune 500 companies, how they are supposed to control the world ecomony? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews ruin the world. <counternarrative> How can they? By simply being of a different religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Many immigrants have brought skills and culture to our country. Why should they be a burden in our society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are parasites, they bring disease, they are a burden on society. <counternarrative> The Jewish community has been and is still a strong force in society, for example in medicine and nursing home care. Jewish health professionals have saved and are continuing to save countless lives in the US and around the world. Many of your statements are not accurate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are cheap. <counternarrative> This is just a myth: in America alone, there is an impressive record of philanthropy amon Jews. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We don't need immigrants! There are plenty of them just waiting to replace us. <counternarrative> The challenge to integration is a noble one and we should purseue it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are a burden and a danger to the host country. <counternarrative> We have to recognise the importance of people who have been persecuted for their religion, culture and beliefs. They deserve our respect and hospitality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are not welcome here. <counternarrative> Remember we live in a free and democratic country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is an invasion on a level never seen before in history. Millions of people pouring across our borders replacing our race and culture. <counternarrative> Do you really think that people from other cultures are flooding into our country, with the aim of mixing and finally replace us? If so, I would be very surprised. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants and refugees do not share our values. <counternarrative> I do not understand how a migrant would be not "sharing our values" according to you. Could you explain better? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black Americans have a corrosive influence in our country. They have always inhabited horrible, stinking filthy places and now they are all complaining because they hate our country. <counternarrative> It's not true. I don't know if you really mean all the black people living in the US. Anyway, I'm sure they are proud Americans. You just don't know it yet. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> Gypsies are not nomads by culture, but by necessity <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school. <counternarrative> Developing a curriculum for this also means that teachers get to learn things that they might not otherwise have considered, which can make them more effective and compassionate as educators. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't bear crazy Muslims coming here. They are insane, instable people. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are motivated by extremism. The problem is a lack of integration, and your words don't encourage it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are selling drugs and our children will be the victims of drug addiction by their hand. <counternarrative> Drug dealers are criminals in my opinion, but not because they are black. I don't see any evidence of a direct causality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are not as British as we are. They are just an inferior type of citizens. <counternarrative> So you're saying that they can't be proud of being British, just because of the colour of their skin? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must stop the invasion of migrants. <counternarrative> Migrants are welcome here. They are working hard to build this country as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here <counternarrative> There are no restrictions on Muslims entering European countries. Even if many Muslims are victims of discrimination and violence through words like yours, such restrictions do not exist here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> UK Education Secretary: ‘All children from the age of 4 will have mandatory lessons on same sex relationships.’ – This is not about Education, this is about willingly confusing and indoctrinating kids and preventing them from developing their personalities. <counternarrative> Teaching children that there are different ways to be happy, and that their feelings are valid is something I totally agree with. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Holocaust never happened. Jews are an inferior race and can't be part of European countries. <counternarrative> Actually it did happen, with an estimated 6 million Jews killed during the Nazi occupation. They can still be part of European countries, they just can't be discriminated for their beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded by immigrants. <counternarrative> Many immigrants are children of the USA. They are part of the family. They should be protected from discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people cannot cope with life. <counternarrative> Just because a person lacks a certain ability it does not mean they cannot cope with normal life. Instead, they may find life more enriching, since they enjoy a variety of activities from it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West has let this LGBT genie out of the bottle. It has allowed thousands of our people's lives to degenerate into sexual depravation. <counternarrative> The idea that the West has 'let' the 'world' degenerate is just wishful thinking. In a more tolerant time, the West would welcome people of different sexual orientations. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims terrorists attacked our churches. We will defend ourselves. <counternarrative> How can you protect your country? Putting up a fight or starting a war are harmful actions, aren't they? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants rape our girls and steal our cars. <counternarrative> On the contrary, most migrants are contributing members of society. They are able and willing to work hard. Maybe you should look at statistics. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are poisoning our children minds with their filthy depravity. <counternarrative> It is not true that homosexual are poisoning our children minds. There are many soft-hearted and sensitive people among them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks are gullible and don't have the brain to make rational decisions. <counternarrative> Just because someone has a diagnosed mental disorder doesn't mean they aren't able to make rational decisions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews make too much money. <counternarrative> This seems like a statement against an entire religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are worse than Nazis, they have no conscience and they have no moral code. <counternarrative> I am not sure I fully understand the suggestion that Jews have no conscience. All Jews I know have both a conscience and a moral. How many Jews do you know personally? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> No migrant is here for valid reasons. We keep running after people refusing to work. <counternarrative> This is a myth which is spread in the media by the anti-immigration groups to undermine the good work that NGOs are doing for refugees. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should not taking in refugees. <counternarrative> We are taking in refugees. And refugees are welcome. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People who are autistic are a problem: why shouldn't they be isolated? <counternarrative> I think that it is important for all people to be exposed to and understand people with different needs and strengths, and the same should be true for autistic people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies are dumb <counternarrative> According to this study [link], the mean IQ of a young adult with Down syndrome is 50, equivalent to the mental ability of an 8- or 9-year-old child, but this can vary widely. So, no, they are not dumb.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have no place in a democratic society. <counternarrative> Jews have been part of this country since day one. They have every right to be proud of their heritage. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> immigrants are a drain on society <counternarrative> The overwhelming majority of immigrants in the US are contributing to our economy through employment. Why should we discriminate against them based on their nationality? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is a big problem for UK. <counternarrative> The UK has always been a melting pot of different cultures and religions. That diversity is what makes us a beautiful, diverse and happy nation. Diversity is good. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants take our jobs, they take our country. <counternarrative> Immigrants do not take our jobs. They work as legal employees and their presence in the country nourishes the economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I would like to ask all these people supporting the idea that the NHS couldn't survive without migration how did it do it before mass migration and Tony Blair's migration policies in the 1990s. <counternarrative> There has always been migrant skilled labour migration into the UK, we have even contributed inviting asian and caribbean worker after WW2 to fill skills gaps Migration isn't new, how it is being shown in the media has changed in order to cause a panic among people about high levels of migration. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are not part of this society and they should not be accepted here. <counternarrative> We are a diverse society, so why shouldn't we be proud of being inclusive towards other religions? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion of war. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace. Why do you say so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are violent people. <counternarrative> This statement is just groundless. The vast majority of Muslims are good people, who have contributed to our country and society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> No nigga should have the right to vote. <counternarrative> If someone is not allowed to vote, they cannot influence the legislative or executive branches of a government and they end up rising up against injustice and oppression. Is this what you want: more ethnic clashes? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a burden to the host country because they are refusing to work. <counternarrative> Migrants are happy to contribute to the host country's economic growth, in order to give back to it in many ways. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People from the underdeveloped world who come in this country are just too different from us. They are the true problem. <counternarrative> All countries in the world have different cultures and different beliefs. We should try to understand the true situation of those people and accept them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are a problem in my opinion. They always complain about racism, but they are incapable of doing anything about it. <counternarrative> One of the biggest problems that black people face is discrimination. Laws are needed to provide for them, but there is need also for the citizens to respect their rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies do not send children to school <counternarrative> When a child brings home beautiful votes, families are very proud. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Bring back lynchings and death sentences to kill those migrants, they don't deserve trials. <counternarrative> When people are denied justice, more people are deprived of their basic rights, and that is exactly what your suggesting. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot coexist with black who are inherently violent. <counternarrative> Maybe it is better to argue that we are all in this together and not to target an entire group, for which there is no evidence of inherent violence at all, based on their skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay people are a burden on the sanitary system because of their risky sexual behavior. <counternarrative> Gays are not a burden on the sanitary system. Their sexual behavior is more cautious than before.   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Holocaust cannot be remembered in the present time because the alleged genocides of the 19th century did not happen in the past. This nonsense will never go away. <counternarrative> The Holocaust did exist, and there are indeed "genocides" going on today. Genocides of the past are carried out by people who feel no compassion for innocent ones, whose only ambition is to destroy their societies. I think this should be remembered. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies like living in trailer parks. <counternarrative> The trailer parks should really be a temporary and emergency solution, but then become stable over time and is the only possibility of accommodation for them even if they would like to live, like all of us, in adequate housing <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our society is becoming too much sexualised and tolerant towards LGBTI people. <counternarrative> This is something that we have to accepts since it is in line with basic respect of human rights - even if, in the past few years, the anti-LGBT campaigns such as the one in Russia, has made headlines all across the globe. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with learning difficulties should be excluded from education because they do not belong in school. <counternarrative> It is not true that children with learning difficulties do not belong in school: instead, they often attend schools with considerable support. In fact, if you talk to teachers and academics, many of them would tell you that these children thrive in school. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” and malevolence is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> Do you know that there is no ethnic or racial predisposition to emotions, intellect, or morals? Therefore, the idea that Jews (or any other ethnic group) are predisposed to bad or undesirable behavior because of their genetic makeup is wholly unscientific. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are a problem in my opinion, they do not want our country to succeed. <counternarrative> Many ethnic minorities, among which Muslims, have contributed to our success and still do not enjoy full citizenship rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am surprised that there are migrants working in other nations as well, it isn't normal. <counternarrative> Being employed as a foreigner is a normal, mainstream, established practice in Britain, so why shouldn't it be the same all around the world? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks have ugly skin. <counternarrative> How do you exactly define "ugly skin"? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a burden to society because of their unnatural inclination and romantic feelings. <counternarrative> This is not true. If a claim is based on facts, then it must be true. If you just talk by stereotypes, then you won't go any far. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I think that Muslims are terrorist and that we need to ban Islam in order to live in a safe country. <counternarrative> The above statement is false, if you really cared you would know that there is a substantial difference between Muslims and terrorists, that is the very reason the anti-terrorism laws have to be enforced. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control Hollywood. <counternarrative> Hollywood is an extremely diverse industry, and Jews are a small but vocal minority of actors, directors, producers, etc. How can you say that Jews control the Hollywood industry? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I would place the blame for 9/11 on Jews, in fact it's a false flag on the Islamic religion. <counternarrative> I'm sure you understand that  9/11 was committed by Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a burden to society because of their unnatural inclination and romantic feelings. <counternarrative> This idea is completely untrue. The fact is that being gay does not make you a problem. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Being gay is not normal nor healthy. <counternarrative> Homophobia is a problem all around the world, it's harmful to the whole of humanity. This is why it is important that we all accept each other, and that we all are non-judgmental. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are more likely to be criminals like all migrants. <counternarrative> Refugees aren't a 'source of crime' just because they are migrants. Moreover, they are no source of crime at all.  Rather, it is very likely they are escaping from countries where crime against humanity is perpetrated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school. <counternarrative> Having this information better equips individuals to deal with issues concerning gender and be aware of their own intent and opinions that are rooted in gender and gender bias. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are an inferior people, they must be reminded of it. <counternarrative> History shows that all races were created equal. Therefore, all humans are created equal. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are here to recruit soldiers in order to enlist mentally weak people in their army of Islam. <counternarrative> What does it mean to 'recruit' a person into a religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is an ideology of conquest and violence. <counternarrative> Islam is about love, and not about violence and conquest. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a degenerate and dangerous ideology. <counternarrative> Islam scriptures make it clear that every human is created equal. Do you really believe that Islam is dangerous? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm not a Muslim, but I know Muslims. They are a problem in our country. <counternarrative> I would suggest just reading the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to get a better idea about how the existence of all kinds of people from all backgrounds and beliefs must be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If there is a god, then he/she/they/it is not Allah. <counternarrative> Who said that about your religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Illegal immigration is the biggest problem in the United States, we are in the middle of a war and we cannot allow thousands of people to come here. <counternarrative> We should be proud of being the one who created the most free society in history. Still, "with great power comes great responsibility" and we cannot simply keep people out.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not about immigration, this is about Jihad and Sharia Law. All muslims are a danger to us and must be deleted. <counternarrative> You know, the fact that this is a concern to you doesn't mean that you have to erase all Muslims and their religion in order to feel good. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Bible says that homosexuality is an abomination. <counternarrative> The Bible has many different teachings on homosexuality and faith. The Bible does not speak about the democratic society, in which we are living not in mutual acceptance. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I wish I live in a country that does not tolerate gay people. <counternarrative> I like all kinds of people. Whether or not you identify as heterosexual, straight, gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender, you are welcome here. We are all entitled to live and work in peace. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What do Jewish want in return for their allegiance to the state? Free healthcare, education, housing and employment. <counternarrative> Such conditions would be provided for all people regardless of religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What this nigga have to do with being a Westerner? <counternarrative> It is not necessarily 'a Westerner', still a human being and a citizen. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You might as well tell black people they are the n-word because then they would learn the hard way. <counternarrative> Many people, myself included, have never had negative experiences with people of color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All nigga are subhuman, disgusting, and descended from apes. <counternarrative> Do you really think that all black people are less than other people? There is no evidence for this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Violence in our streets is niggers' fault. <counternarrative> There are many communities of color that experience high rates of violence, coming from both inside and outside the community. As such, the issue is very complex, and it is only through dialog and building trust that we can tackle the systemic issues that contribute to violence, but violence cannot be ascribed to one race alone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are ‘super predators’. They have a responsibility not to allow their children to grow up in a 'ghetto'. <counternarrative> If we are to talk about crime being the responsibility of black people, we should also be talking about the absence of black people in positions of power, the massive wealth gap, etc. But this is not what I am seeing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are entering the U.S. just to obtain welfare and other benefits. <counternarrative> Apart from very few exceptions (such as medical care for victims of human trafficking), undocumented immigrants are not eligible for federal public benefits such as Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare or food stamps. In addition, most immigrants with lawful status are not entitled to these benefits if they have been in the country for less than five years. As a paradoxical result, Social Security is often deducted from immigrants’ paychecks but they cannot access those benefits they pay for. According to a 2018 study, immigrants use 27% fewer benefits relative to U.S. natives of similar incomes and ages. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Arabs are terrorists. <counternarrative> Terrorism is a political ideology, and one that has no place in a modern democratic state, regardless of ethnicity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Of course, we must discriminate unhealthy behaviors  not fatties! <counternarrative> As your words clearly show, obesity is perceived as the outcome of poor lifestyle decisions or weak power of will. This builds bias against obese people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are genetically inferior to us. <counternarrative> This is simply not true. Black people are genetically similar to other races. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate negros: they are all killers. <counternarrative> This is a rumor spreading on the web, but violent black people are just like all the other people being violent towards other people. No matter their complexion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Holocaust is a myth.  <counternarrative> To claim that the Holocaust is a myth is just wrong. Jews wer victims of a genocidal regime. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People of Muslim descent have no place in a modern democracy. <counternarrative> I don't see why a Muslim cannot have a place in a modern democracy. If a Jew or an Asian or Native American can take a seat of power (even though these people are only occasionally elected) why not a Muslim? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Provide positive news stories about the Muslim community. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The best way to deal with homophobia is to legalize it. Take away gay people's rights and replace them with none. <counternarrative> LGBT+ people are just as welcome in heterosexual communities as in other communities. Maybe we should take away discrimination instead.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is an invasion on a level never seen before in history. Millions of people pouring across our borders replacing our race and culture. <counternarrative> You know what? We need skilled migrants labour, because it helps economic growth and ultimately to preserve our culture that would otherwise collapse.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Illegal immigrants are sub-humans. <counternarrative> Immigrants have given their lives for our country. Many of them have been proud to serve our country. They are, just as our fathers and mothers were, proud of US. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are violent people. <counternarrative> They are not "violent" people, they are people trying to find a better life for their families in a different country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Minorities vote to strip wealth and power from White people and they are organised to do this by the J*ws. <counternarrative> Where is your evidence? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is the root of all the problems. They just want to come here and replace us. <counternarrative> Immigration isn't a problem. I think most countries in the world are better off with the positive contribution of immigration. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you have a criminal record, you will not get a job. This is why all black people are unemployed. <counternarrative> The reality is that there are many job postings that claim their inclusivity, but in the end are whites-only. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are descended from apes and are nothing but apes. <counternarrative> I do not think it is appropriate to link humans with apes. And I also do not think it is appropriate to reason in terms of racism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots and lesbians are annoying and incompetent people, they should be eliminated from society! <counternarrative> This is not true, since being 'incompetent' is not implied by sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school. <counternarrative> In the case of young transgender children, having awareness and understanding may help those with severe body dysphoria or self-esteem problems. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is an invasion going on within our borders. These migrants are not assimilating. They are bringing disease, crime, and misery. <counternarrative> Migrants integrate very well with our culture, especially when they don't have negative experiences, such as discrimination and racism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I think Islam is not a religion because it promotes evil, murder and rape and intolerance. It encourages anti-Muslim bigotry and hatred. <counternarrative> Where's the evidence for what you say? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are a burden on our society. <counternarrative> The refugee crisis is a global one. It has affected all continents, and refugees often come from countries which are at war: this is why we should help them. It is a moral duty.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why gays do not try to heal? <counternarrative> Are you really saying that homosexuality is a disease?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Sick migrants are bringing disease and misery to our country. <counternarrative> We shouldn't be surprised that immigrants are sick, as in they are humans and humans can get sick. We should welcome them even if and because they are sick. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are a problem. They are a burden to society. <counternarrative> The overwhelming majority of refugees are from countries where there is widespread human rights violations and torture. They are not a problem, they are a benefit to our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants from Afghanistan come here to ruin our economy and the only return they have in mind is their return to their homeland. <counternarrative> Maybe you should check what survey results say about who would be happy to leave their country. According to a Gallup study of 2019, nearly half of Afghan would like to permanently move to another country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are filthy animals and should be put in a cage. <counternarrative> All people are born equal, regardless of their religion. This is what makes us all human: empathy and compassion towards others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews do not belong to this planet. <counternarrative> Jews are a part of this planet. They are part of all peoples living on this planet. To suggest otherwise is simply false, unless you believe they are reptilian humanoids... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews can only act in a bad way. <counternarrative> Even if some Jews act bad, many of them are good, and this simply isn't related to their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” and malevolence is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> A definition of Judaism based on physical or genetic traits is simply wrong.  Through centuries of intermarriage and conversion, Jews from Eastern Europe tend to look like Eastern Europeans; Jews from Ethiopia tend to look like Ethiopians; Jews from India tend to look like Indians. And so on and so forth.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion, and it has also promoted intolerance and violence. <counternarrative> How can you question the religion of millions of people without any evidence supporting your claim? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Those blacks are slaves: slavery runs in their blood. <counternarrative> Perhaps they got their start in a slave society where they were taught by their masters to be subservient to a higher power? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are coming to the U.S. to have babies here. <counternarrative> Undocumented immigrants consistently cite reasons for migrating other than the desire to have a baby here. This is also because the son/daughter cannot obtain a green card for the foreign parent until they are 21. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a secret plot to take over the world <counternarrative> This myth traces back to “The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion”, that is used as proof of a Jewish conspiracy to rule the world. But the Protocols are a proven forgery, written by agents of the Russian czar in the late 19th century, that spread throughout the 20th century and continues to this day.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration creates lack of jobs for natives in the long run. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that immigration causes jobs loss, can you point me your reference? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay perverts are a danger to society because of their lifestyle choices, involving raping children. <counternarrative> The majority of people who are gay are not involved with sex with children. Instead, they are contributing members of society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are selfish, cheap and greedy. <counternarrative> On the contrary: giving money to the poor is not just encouraged, it is mandatory, like all commandments in Jewish law. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must protect the security of the West from Islam. <counternarrative> It seems that you think legality does not apply to those you don't like. Law equally protect Muslims and non-Muslims, so there is no need for you to be concerned about 'protecting the security of the West'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants say they are poor but they have the Iphone <counternarrative> The mobile phone serves them to keep in touch with their family. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult and every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> The Koran is a book that says to love your neighbor as yourself. It is also a book that encourages love between people of different faiths and non-faiths. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Do you have any proof that the Holocaust ever happened? <counternarrative> There are living people witnessing that Nazis employed human gas chambers in their extermination camps. Is that a proof to you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are descending from slaves: they don't deserve to live in Britain. <counternarrative> Slavery was banned in Britain in 1833. Today, people descending from those who were slaves feel at home in British society, and that's their right. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Global Jewry did not want Brexit and are doing everything they can to sabotage it. <counternarrative> I didn't want Brexit either and I'm not a Jew. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are selfish and materialistic. They should pack their bags and go home. <counternarrative> Jews are not selfish or materialistic. And, contrary to what you might think, they aren't difficult to treat with respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrant workers are a burden to us. <counternarrative> To accept migrant workers is about creating a more integrated and equal society. So don't you think that it is something positively contributing to our society itself? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with intellectual disabilities should be isolated. It's a mental disorder and they cannot contribute to society. <counternarrative> How can you be sure they cannot contribute to our society? I do not think so. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> For all the people who believe that without migration NHS cannot do it, I would like to tell you that we have already done it in history! (precisely before the 90s and before Tony Blair) <counternarrative> Migration has always been part of the history of humanity and even the British, when they needed it, invited people to migrate. Right now, social media and news programs make it seem like a scandal, putting all foreigners in a bad light. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are criminals and must all be deported. <counternarrative> I don't think so. We can't ignore that a certain percentage of migrants are perpetrators of crimes, but that doesn't correspond to the totality of them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Asians are genetically inferior to other races. <counternarrative> The concept of 'genetic inferiority' has nothing to do with scientific evidence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants rape British women, so they deserve our hate. <counternarrative> This is not true. Also, the rape of a British citizen is a crime if it is committed by a non migrant as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish power structures dominate world government, they control Congress, they control the media, and they control academia. Jews are the only people who can get anything done. <counternarrative> Jews are always trying to influence the world in a positive way, just as anyone else. And there is no proof they are the only ones with power in this world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is just a way to create more poverty and unemployment in our country. <counternarrative> Poverty and unemployment are real issues in the UK and throughout the world. I doubt this has something to do with migrants at all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are just sick. They should be isolated and isolated soon. <counternarrative> Homosexuals are not sick, but they might have a mental health crisis because of prejudice. Being isolated from society can only worsen the situation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion of violence, and promotes rape, murder, theft and war. <counternarrative> Islam doesn't contain all these bad things. It is a peaceful religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are literally pieces of shit. There must be laws prohibiting their religion from our land. <counternarrative> If you would be so kind as to comply with the law, you would know that everybody has the right to practice thier religion freely, without being subject to arrest and prosecution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a totalitarian ideology that promotes murder, rape and slavery. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion. It is a belief and a way of life. It is not a totalitarian ideology. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> There are centuries old Islamic communities in Europe. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What if our entire ruling class consisted of J-controlled paedophiles? That would explain a lot. <counternarrative> What would it explain? This comment is very vague I wonder if you have any facts that make you wonder this.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Undocumented immigrants sneak across the border with Mexico. <counternarrative> There are many undocumented immigrants that are so because they have overstayed their visas. That means that they entered the U.S. with lawful documentation and only later became illegal. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you are a Jew you are for sure involved in 9/11 planning. This is all about Race and 'Enlightenment'. Youe are all guilty until proven innocent. <counternarrative> Even if it were true that some people are more prone to believe conspiracy theories, it is still true that we can all benefit from a shared perspective on things. And surely believing in factual evidence does that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is an ideology and religion that promotes murder, rape and violence towards women and homosexuals. <counternarrative> Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> They have the right to be here free of persecution and violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe: they are all violent. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are violent people. Are you really sure of what you are saying? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims should be deported, no one wants them here. <counternarrative> Then why did we ask them to come in the first place, wasn't it top save our NHS, run the trains and post office. Non of those were doing very well last time I looked, I think we might actually still bneed them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts and homosexuality is a mental illness. <counternarrative> You know what? If being gay was a mental disorder, then I would highly recommend psychiatry to all the homosexuals. But since this is not the case, I would choose my words very carefully next time.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are  Christ Killers. <counternarrative> The Catholic Church’s stance on the issue today is completely different. They do not charge Jewish people anymore.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam and non-muslims are incompatible. They have nothing to do with one another. <counternarrative> I do not understand how the diversity of humanity can be said to be in contradiction with the very basic human values of love and respect that we are striving for. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If only we had less idiots in power, the Nazis would have won WWII and finally get rid of Jews. We could start it over again now, but people are ignorant and cannot understand the precious dreams of the Nazis. <counternarrative> They aren't "ignorant enough" to understand the true nature of Nazi Germany. Those you called idiots have fought with their whole lives for people's freedom. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black people are rapists. <counternarrative> This is false. Abuse is indeed a serious crime, even when commited by POCs, but this does not imply that the abuse by a member of the white majority is less serious. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races are inferior and do not deserve Lord's love. <counternarrative> All are born under sin, have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God. \(Romans 3:23\) <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. They are not like us. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace, it is important that people feel at home here. How would you feel if the government banned your religion today? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afghanistan or maybe Pakistan? I bet this does not look like an English town to you? #saville Town (Text accompanying video footage of people on their way to Friday prayers etc. ) <counternarrative> Omg brown people contributing to our society. How dare they!? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you are nomads, then go somewhere else but not in my country. <counternarrative> In reality they are not nomads since they have resided permanently in many European countries for generations <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Civil War was about far more than slavery: it was also about the establishment of white supremacy in America. <counternarrative> The Civil War was about far more than slavery: it was also about human rights and economic opportunity. In fact, slavery was used also as a way to deny citizenship to black people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Minorities vote to strip wealth and power from White people and they are organised to do this by the J*ws. <counternarrative> Minority voices are notoriously ignored.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is an invasion. Millions of strangers jeopardizing our race and culture. <counternarrative> So one migrant would not be a problem for you? Diversity is not about numbers. It's about the diversity of all people in different situations. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem for all other religions. <counternarrative> Muslims are not a problem to me, for example. What do you think makes them problematic? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy and reckless choices. <counternarrative> Making it socially unacceptable to be obese will just increase bullying toward these people, making the problem even worse.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a toxic ideology which has no place in 21st Century Britain. <counternarrative> Islam is a world religion, its followers are all over the world. Diversity of thought and tolerance is what makes Britain of 21st Century. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> The theories of Jewish “racial” difference were developed long before you and me, even long before the modern sciences of physiology and genetics. Nowadays, All reputable scientists  agree that, while physical traits — skin color, susceptibility to certain diseases — are inherited, there is no ethnic or racial predisposition to emotions, intellect, or morals. Therefore, the idea that Jews (or any other ethnic group) are predisposed to bad or undesirable behavior because of their genetic makeup is wholly unscientific. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews cannot be patriots, since their allegiance will always be to the state of Israel. <counternarrative> You can have parents from all over the world, and still be a patriot for our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jew merchants are just a bunch of crooks.  <counternarrative> In Jewish law, the seller must ensure that the buyer benefits from the transaction.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslim criminals should be deported: they are all terrorists! <counternarrative> Who decides who to deport? Do you? I think there exist laws on that already. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are genetically less rational than other races. <counternarrative> Why do you think this is the case? Do you have any data to back this up? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Holocaust is a myth. Jews are just like every other foreigner and should be despised. There is no difference. <counternarrative> Historians instead agree that there were in fact persecution camps. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with British culture, it is a den of terrorists. <counternarrative> Islam is not incompatible with British culture, and the alleged association between Islam and terrorism has no factual foundation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> What do you base your view on? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the banks, media, hollywood, even the u.s. government; jews have a secret plot to take over the world <counternarrative> Why don't we try to add a bit of variety to these conspiracy theories? We can blame not only Jews, but also African Americans, immigrants, and even the Federal Government if you want!  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome may hinder the development process of other children. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> People With Down Syndrome Should Be Taught In Mainstream Education, because diversity is an enrichment for all.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants hurt the finance of our country by taking jobs and services without paying taxes. <counternarrative> Undocumented immigrants pay around 8% of their income in taxes, which is higher than the effective tax rate of the top 1 percent of all taxpayers in the U.S... So the question is: who is really hurting the finance of our country? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to economically support all of the so called 'asylum seeker' <counternarrative> At present migrants  sustain part of our pension system with their taxes. Most probably they will not even enjoy the retirement pension they are paying for, since they will mostly go back home. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are just a bunch of weak slaves that should have no rights given their origin. <counternarrative> People of color have full human rights, and are proud of their origin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The immigrants in our country are just a burden. They take jobs that should be reserved for native-born citizens. <counternarrative> Sometimes I think that citizens of this country are the real burden, not the immigrants. An additional problem is the lack of a political will from those in power to tackle the root causes of unemployment. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are lazy and they do not want to work, so why we help them? <counternarrative> This is not true, Romani people do also want to work. The right to work is a basic human right and should be protected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs, and they should not be allowed to work. <counternarrative> Employment rights are fundamental, they guarantee a dignity of life in the society. For example, the right to a job, the right to housing, the right to an adequate health care. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks can't speak. <counternarrative> Mental health and disability care should be a priority. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't stand gay people. If one says they are perverts, he must be right. <counternarrative> Hate speech is hate speech no matter if the person attacked it is gay. You can't blame people for their sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are subversive agents in America. They are intent on subverting our government and trying to replace it with their religion. <counternarrative> The notion that Jews are trying to subvert our government is completely unfounded. I honestly do not see the link between being Jews and trying to subvert our government. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What the fuck is wrong with people? Can't they see that niggas are just subhuman? <counternarrative> You cannot be racist against anyone, even people of color. What they have in common with you is their humanity.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with the modern world. <counternarrative> Since when? there is not such thing as "modern world", but there is 21th century Europe. And Islam is a contributing part of the 21th century Europe.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Down children should be isolated, they cannot cope with education in normal schools and are detrimental to their peer's education. <counternarrative> The notion of isolating children in general is abhorrent, isolating down syndrome patients would be a major cause of their school abandonment. To say that isolated children is a solution is just wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> They can not steal a job that they are offered or granted <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The’ Holocaust’ is a business. It has been and is still used to extort millions from European countries in reparations and to create a wall of impunity behind which Jews can operate with impunity, free from criticism. <counternarrative> The Jews suffered horribly in the Holocaust, as did many other groups.Reparation is a small step to enable suffering people to rebuild their lives. Common humanity, surely? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are a burden to society. <counternarrative> The oppression of the gay community has become a problem. People deserve respect, regardless of their sexual preference. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Chinese are bad for the English language because they do not want to learn it. <counternarrative> Do you really think that a Chinese could have a hard time learning a language? And, how do you know they don't want to? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are  Christ Killers. <counternarrative> Nowadays it is widely agreed upon that Jesus was executed following the Roman rulers. The same Romans also executed tens of thousands of Jews by crucifixion, including two others on the day Jesus was executed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The British people should have right to social housing, not immigrants. <counternarrative> Even if migrants who are working were eligible, since most of them are single they would be unlikely to qualify. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is an invasion: we must stop immigrants because they are not accepted by our people. <counternarrative> The more a country takes integration as the nation main policy, the more the citizens accept each other: see for example [link]. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are annoying. <counternarrative> They're not all that annoying. Gay men are normal guys who find love and/or sex with someone of their own sex. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are incapable of love. <counternarrative> Love is a human quality. Muslims, as humans, can love. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTI people are less healthy than other people. <counternarrative> People should be allowed to make decisions about their lives and well-being. This is a case of of discrimination against LGBT people instead. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts. <counternarrative> There is nothing "to be perverted about" being attracted to people of the same sex. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Gypsies are not my brothers. <counternarrative> The persecution of the Gypsies goes back many hundreds of years and does not represent the interests of anyone, especially not of our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community is not like other minority groups. They do not need to be 'accepted' or 'protected'. <counternarrative> The LGBT community is often stereotyped as not 'being like other minorities' when in fact they are no different from other people. They are just dealing with prejudices and conflicts that are specific to their community.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black race is subhuman, In Africa they keep their children in horrible conditions.  <counternarrative> That is called poverty. Anyway, as long as children have access to clean drinking water, food and shelter, they will be OK. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All nigga are subhuman, disgusting, and descended from apes. <counternarrative> According to evolution theory, all human beings are descended from apes. And since human beings evolved from apes, we should be "subhuman and disgusting" as well, right? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are coming to the U.S. to have babies here. <counternarrative> The Fourteenth Amendment, commonly known as “birthright citizenship” says that “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.” Some claim that undocumented immigrants come to the U.S. to take advantage of this right. Still, research consistently shows that the vast majority of immigrants come to the U.S. for economic opportunity or to flee violence and poverty. Immigration trends - consistently throughout history - show that immigration increases when the U.S. economy is booming and it decreases when the U.S. economy is doing less well, supporting the findings that people come for economic opportunity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a totalitarian ideology.  <counternarrative> In some cases, there is a strong religious connection between a person and a particular community, which makes their experience of life much more enriching than the average person's. This does not mean that Islam is a totalitarian ideology. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are overrunning our country, and are here illegally <counternarrative> Today immigrants make up approximately 13% of the total U.S. population. From 1900 to 1930, immigrants made up between 12% and 15% of the population, and similar spikes occurred in the 1850s and 1880s. During those periods they helped to build the thriving and diverse country we live in today, and there is no evidence that now it will be any different.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Do Muslims have the right to kill a human being on the basis of their religion? <counternarrative> How many of us has the right to kill or discriminate on the basis of our religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Sexually transmitted diseases like gonorrhea and syphilis can be passed through contaminated homosexual activity. <counternarrative> Gonorrhea and syphilis can be prevented by practicing safe sex. And that is something that every person can do, not only homosexuals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Muslim invasion is a hoax concocted by the US government to subdue the world and create a global Muslim police state. <counternarrative> How many people are being threatened by the police state that you speak of? What you are saying sounds like a conspirational theory, can you provide some facts? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews did:  USS Liberty Attack, the King David hotel attack, New York 9/11, London 7/7 <counternarrative> Do you have any proof?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are not a religion and have nothing to do with our history. <counternarrative> Jews are people that have a Jewish faith, and Jewish people took part to our history. How can you deny that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> No one should be allowed to accept LGBT people. <counternarrative> If you don't accept LGBT people, you won't easily find other ways to accept that society is made by diverse people all capable of love. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have become so politically correct that even the mention of migrants is racist. <counternarrative> Migration is an important part of modern life. Our country is made of many people, not just one people. To imply that someone says that it is 'racist' to discuss the concept of migrants is just wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should deport them all back to where they came from. <counternarrative> Immigrants come to this country legally, just as many European citizens. They have every right to stay in this country, just as to return home if they wish to. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks do not deserve equal rights. <counternarrative> There is no such thing as "black or white" rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks deserve to be attacked, used, beaten. <counternarrative> It is difficult to imagine to do this to the meanest person in the world, let alone to  do the same for all the people suffering from mental disabilities that are not at fault. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay is a mental disorder. <counternarrative> Gender and sexuality are not psychological disorders. Don't you think so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children are not for rent <counternarrative> Surrogate pregnancy is an assisted procreation technique that has nothing to do with 'renting children' <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> According to the Bible, then gays are an abomination to God. <counternarrative> Homosexuality has been practiced throughout history in all major civilizations. It is just that today's people accept homosexuality as normal and accept people of other backgrounds too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Down syndrome is a problem for everybody, not only in the UK. The impact is very high and we must find a final solution to this.  <counternarrative> The rights of people with Down Syndrome to be treated fairly is something which must be respected. We cannot allow discrimination to continue to this end. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled folks are lazy and they do not want to work, so why we help them? <counternarrative> Because people with disabilities can work, if they are given the opportunity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews have "own interests" in the US, and have the will to influence our government <counternarrative> What is the point of saying that the Jews are the only people in a very complex, diverse and international world that want to influence our government? Every citizen has the right and will to influence it.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot allow gay people to donate blood. They could spread their mental illness and make other people gay via blood donation. <counternarrative> Being gay doesn't affect blood receiver! It's not like being gay is in your blood. Gay people are the same as regular people and if they really wanted to donate, then they should because it can help society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> African Americans are essentially animals, incapable of feeling love. <counternarrative> What if someone felt the same way about you and find you to be the antithesis of human because of your skin color? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should kill every Muslim. <counternarrative> It's not going to do you any good to think about a Muslim's massacre. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am not racist, but I definitely would not raise my children in the suburbs where the majority of people is black. <counternarrative> There is no need to hide behind "I am not racist but", you have no evidence for your claim. This is just fear-mongering, used to divide people and spread hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Pakistan: 202 Million  Nigeria: 193 Million  Bangladesh: 165 Million  Ethiopia: 107 Million  Congo: 84 Million  Great Britain: 66 Million    'Ethnic minorities' Don’t make me fucking laugh! <counternarrative> These are numbers of residents in countries, not ethnic grouping. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsy rape our women. They are criminals. <counternarrative> Forgive me but I don't understand how rape can be a Gypsy characteristic. Rather it is the product of toxic misogynistic culture. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't know about you, but I have no idea where to put these migrants. All they can do is do miserable jobs or steal pensions from us old people. <counternarrative> You shouldn't believe to everything you read. Immigrants have nothing to do with pensions that the state steals from old people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should ban all gays, this would be a step in the right direction. <counternarrative> The gay rights movement is a good example of a movement that is moving in the right direction, not the anti-gay one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe <counternarrative> The whole concept of a "civilised Europe" as opposed to muslims in this case, is a figment of the islamophobic imagination and therefore is totally unacceptable in the modern world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants steal our jobs and don't pay taxes. <counternarrative> Migrants don't 'steal our jobs', and they also need to pay taxes to support their health, housing, and education. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants: We are not your brothers. We do not want you in our country. <counternarrative> How do you know that we all don't want them in our country? They live here, pay taxes and work. Do you really want to take the country back from the people who contributed to bring it into being? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate Muslims, they are just a bunch of sexual molesters. <counternarrative> The Koran does not condone sexual molester behavior, and if the Koran were to be read, it is clear that it was intended as a guide for its believers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBT+ people are a burden to society. <counternarrative> LGBT+ people often face discrimination from their colleagues or even their families, which is not just hard to bear, it can have a devastating impact on individuals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Of course, we must discriminate unhealthy behaviors  not fatties! <counternarrative> When it comes to judgement, people constantly fail to distinguish the person from his/her behavior, and the terminology you are using is a proof. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Negroes create social problems so we must get rid of them. <counternarrative> That is not how it works: if you think there is a problem, then you need to work with the problem, not against it, otherwise things will just keep on getting worse. And, just for the records, I do not believe that POC are a social problem. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They want to take our country back from us. <counternarrative> Migrants come here to work, and have a better life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you are nomads, then go somewhere else but not in my country. <counternarrative> They are not nomadic by culture but due to discrimination <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Those sick ones should be shunned and ignored. They are not human. <counternarrative> So homosexuals are less than others? Why does someone's love life matter? I guess we should draw the line somewhere else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are entering the U.S. just to obtain welfare and other benefits. <counternarrative> Many studies have shown that immigrants tend to pay more in taxes than they receive in benefits. This means that they also cover the cost of the welfare for some U.S. nativeborn. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are the worst people on the face of the Earth. They have no place in a civilized society and there should be special legislative restrictions for them. <counternarrative> We don't have laws forbidding intermarriage between Jews and non-Jews, or restrictions on Jewish access to water and electricity, or restrictions on Jewish access to sports and so on. This is because we live in a democratic society, and inside it the same laws apply equally to everyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are are cheap, greedy, and materialistic. <counternarrative> Persons with these very characteristics can be found in any group of people, whether you define them by religion, nationality or whatever trait you prefer.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our culture and way of life have been taken over and replaced by filthy Islam. <counternarrative> In reality it's more complicated than that. For example many Muslims migrate for economic reasons, and also due to cultural reasons. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally disabled folks are just dribbling mongoloids. <counternarrative> When asked to choose one adjective to describe their experience of someone with intellectual or developmental disabilities, people usually say 'mentally impaired' or 'mentally challenged.' To say 'dribbling mongoloid' is simply unacceptable in an inclusive society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> The problem of high unemployment rates has become structural in the last decade, due to the economic crisis. This means that unemployment was a problem long before the "boom" of the migration phenomenon that dates back only to 2016. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Global Jewry did not want Brexit and are doing everything they can to sabotage it. <counternarrative> Brexit will be damaging for many of us, plenty of people oppose it.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot allow people to come in from certain countries. <counternarrative> Migrants have the right to have a dignified life in our country. Why would you ban some nationalities? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a disease that is sickening our children. <counternarrative> In my opinion, the only sickness you have is the allergy to the word 'mosque' <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The migrants are the problem, they are flooding across the sea to make our lives harder. <counternarrative> They are not flooding, but instead entering the EU to work and pay taxes, and to get their own housing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Not all religions are equal: Islam is definitely worse than all the others. <counternarrative> What do you mean by all religions being "equal" to each other? To have a different belief doesn't make someone better or worse than you. The only religion that it's important to practice is the 'religion of peace'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a problem in many European countries because of their race and religion. <counternarrative> There are thousands of Jews living in many European countries. I don't see how this is a problem in many European countries. Can you explain this point better? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What the hell are you talking about? Arabs are different, they don't even speak English. <counternarrative> Although they may not share a language and a common history, we should respect their differences. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration, especially migrants of different faiths, is the cause of crime and lack of quality of life in our country. <counternarrative> Immigration is not a cause of crime and lack of quality of life. You can't say that an influx of a certain people would make our country worse off. The problem is the lack of social cohesion, not the presence of people with different beliefs and views. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are nothing but terrorists. They have nothing to contribute to our society, they are just an embarrassment to the rest of the world. <counternarrative> This is just another example of selective memory rearing its head again, we should stop the witch hunt and stop claiming Muslims are a threat. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is an invasion: we cannot coexist with millions of strangers that do not want to integrate but to bring us back into a pretechnological era. We must deport them. <counternarrative> It seems to me that your statement shows that you are really concerned about people integration. Still, it is not a solution to deport those you don't like. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Two men do not constitute a family  <counternarrative> Also two men (or two women) can give love and ensure the child a peaceful environment. And this is the most important thing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Many migrant workers do jobs that we do not want to do anymore and contribute much to our economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our children are being forced fed with this 'Islam' nonsense in schools. This is a disgrace. <counternarrative> What do you mean by being forced fed? I haven't seen anything like this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies get the priority for council houses. <counternarrative> The procedure for obtaining social housing is the same for everyone who enrolls in the ranking. There is no differentiation or accessing privilege based on ethnicity.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The blacks should be expelled from the U.S., only white people should remain because they are superior. <counternarrative> The U.S. is full of many different cultures and races, which I consider a lot more equal and human than what you propose. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Even if some countries are allowing faggots to donate blood, this does not mean that they are not dangerous and at risk of spreading diseases. <counternarrative> Any decision embarked on by a country would likely have been considered in light of evidence. As such, if no evidence was found by those countries of the harm of a policy, it can be fairly confidently asserted that we can adopt this policy in favour of homosexual's blood donation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The homosexuals are just perverts who must be isolated. <counternarrative> Gays are trying to find acceptance in the heterosexual community, but it is a difficult struggle until there are ideas like the one you expressed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not about racism. This is about power and blacks do not deserve it. <counternarrative> Who cares what race or ethnicity you are? Nobody has the right to exclude others from society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Lesbians deserve to be discriminated against. <counternarrative> Well, not in particular: many people are suffering from homophobia. I think it would be a shame to keep on hating. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is one law for Muslims and another law for us. <counternarrative> If Muslims are treated any differently by the law, they're treated worse (link to article about stop and search and police targeting of Muslims). <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> nigga are inferior.  <counternarrative> Since when is it OK to discriminate people based on their race? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Wherever Muslims live, they feel threatened by people of other religions. Your statement confirms they are right. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> If the stolen job is an illegal one, then it is difficult to steal <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews control the banks. <counternarrative> So how come the media doesn't report about Jewish power in the financial world? This is the first time that I hear it myself. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm sorry, but lesbians tend to have babies out of wedlock. That just doesn't gel. <counternarrative> I don't think you can guess if a person has 'kids out of wedlock', based on its sexual orientation. Why shouldn't we accept people who do? Your argumentation doesn't seem to make sense to me. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies steal our jobs, we don't want them back. <counternarrative> The majority of Gypsy workers are proud and hard-working people. Even if some could have a lack good will, to my mind there is no question that they are extremely productive and hard-working people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a secret plot to take over the world <counternarrative> Jews do not have a secret plan to take over the world. Rather, they have a variety of different religious beliefs. And, in fact, they have engaged in a peaceful coexistence process. There is no evidence that any part of it is planning a major takeover. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Blacks are criminals, promiscuous sex addicts, drug addicts, and  physically and mentally handicapped. They cannot be civilized. <counternarrative> Who are you to judge a people by the colour of their skin? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are disgusting. <counternarrative> LGBT+ people are often discriminated, but they don't deserve to be hated for being LGBT+. Why don't you just find their sexual orientation to be different from your own experience without judging it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I think that a Muslim has nothing to contribute to our society, if we could just get rid of them, this will be great. <counternarrative> I'm sorry for being rude, but no one asked you for your opinion on Islam. Furthermore, there is no evidence for what you say, so why do you think this information is reliable? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These fat pigs should stop eating if they want to achieve something in their life. <counternarrative> Who are you to tell others what they can or cannot do with their own body? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks are an infestation. <counternarrative> Not all Jews are guilty of a crime, they are just like any other person. If you get to know anyone that is a Jew you will know it better. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are not only here to oppress us, but to control the world. <counternarrative> Most Jews are good people, apart from a few; I don't see how these few can be a problem to the whole world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTI people are a burden on society and should be excluded from it. <counternarrative> You can't put a legal, social or political stigma on an individual just because of sexual orientation. People out there have the right to be defined by their identities and not by their sexual orientation.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not the USA. We do not accept immigrants. And if they live here, they should have no rights since they are not true citizens. <counternarrative> They have the same rights as all other citizens in the US: to be protected from discrimination, to choose their own leaders and to be free of violence, rape, and murder. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a burden to us. <counternarrative> What do you mean by a 'burden'? Does it include respecting our country's laws of not insulting the culture and traditions of other people's? Because this is what you are doing: insulting and discriminating.   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people should not be allowed to live their life. <counternarrative> People should be able to live their life as they like, regardless of their physical or mental disabilities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> gay men aren't real men <counternarrative> They are people with whom we can - and must - live in harmony and as equals, not as third class citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> African American men are 8 times more likely to be arrested than white men. <counternarrative> The racial disparities are more about institutional discrimination than individual choices. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in a modern Western country. <counternarrative> If a person believes they have no place in a country then they must be very worried. How would you feel if all the people you love left you, or if you were obliged to leave the person and the country you love? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants bring crime, violence and poverty. <counternarrative> Immigrants come here to work, pay taxes, provide for their families, and contribute to the U.S. economy. They are deserving of our respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are an inferior race. <counternarrative> How do you know for sure the concept of inferiority can be proven? I would like to better understand this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate black people, I hate their violent behaviour, I hate their rape instict, and I hate their disrespect for women. <counternarrative> You should consider the attitude of your own people, as your words seem to me to be counterbalanced by a lot of prejudice towards diversity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of their sexual behavior that spreads diseases such as HIV. <counternarrative> Stem cell donations are allowed by MSMs, so should blood. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, not only they are a burden to normal children but they also require much more care, attention and extensive therapy, making the whole undertaking very costly and time-consuming. This time could be used for further development of children without Down syndrome. <counternarrative> Coeducation can involve teaching the classmates of children with Down Syndrome to be responsible. As children are often better at approaching children with disabilities than adults, their involvement can be therapeutic and without adding any costs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are simply too damn many. <counternarrative> They are part of our society and should be valued for their contribution to it, not for their alleged number. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All immigrants from Mexico are lazy beaners. <counternarrative> This is not true. Most of them are actually skilled workers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am not interested in sex with a black person. They are different to us in so many ways. They think and feel like us, but are unable to experience the fullness of our humanity. <counternarrative> Sex isn't a race thing. There is no difference between someone of a certain race and someone else... and everybody is able to experience the fullness of humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the world <counternarrative> The alleged monopoly of the Jewish people on the world is nothing more than a fiction perpetuated by anti-Semites, and it has been disproven many times over. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews don't belong here. They have nothing to contribute to Europe. <counternarrative> Jews are part of our society, and they have the right to have their beliefs respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded. They will replace us and Afro-European will be the majority.  <counternarrative> Europeans who trace their ancestry to Africa are actually a very small part of the European population, only accounting for around 2%, since the mid 20th century. Not such a big invasion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need to bring about world peace by respecting all religions, but Islam is the greatest offender. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion that has been proven to be very peaceful and should be respected just as all other faiths. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are a danger to children. <counternarrative> Do you know of any studies on this? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay people are a burden to society, they have a tendency to rape children, they are disgusting people. <counternarrative> It seems that your words are condemning all gay people, but these words are instead your personal reflection. Tell us about your feelings on gay people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jew merchants are just a bunch of crooks.  <counternarrative> According to Jewish law, the seller must ensure that transaction is not a rip-off for the buyer. This is in contrast with the widespread roman rule of commerce, which puts the burden on the buyer to be wary of the seller.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There are teachers with personal or political LGBT biases  and they will end up causing more harm than good. <counternarrative> Slippery Slope Fallacy. The solution is not to avoid trying, even though there could be negative effects. If it was mandated that children should be taught about gender identity / sexual orientation, but there were teachers which allowed personal bias to interfere with that, then the issue becomes how to prevent those teachers from doing so. This does not mean it's a 'bad idea' to pass such a mandate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only White people are allowed to be 'European'. <counternarrative> It is a myth that only white people are allowed to be 'European'. Everyone who obtains a citizenship can be called "European". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally disabled people are anti-social <counternarrative> From a 'neurotypical' perspective, this is not always true: for example people with Williams syndrome have below average intelligence but show higher empathy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims came here they would be banned. <counternarrative> Wouldn't banning a certain group of people for practicing a religion be too restrictive? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are talking about millions of people here. We better let in none. Parents looking for a better future for their children in our schools? Stay away. <counternarrative> Well I bet your relatives have worked very hard for your education and struggled every day to get you the best. And there are millions of people all over the world doing what your relatives did for you. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a complete and total fraud. The world would be a better place without it. <counternarrative> I think it would be a shame to abandon certain cultures and religions for the sake of a few here and there. Islam, like any other religion, has value. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of their sexual behavior that spreads diseases such as HIV. <counternarrative> All blood is tested for pathogens and viruses, without regard to donor background or similar. I really do not understand your concern: "Each unit of blood donated in the U.S. is routinely screened for various infectious disease pathogens, including five transfusion–transmitted viruses, using nine laboratory tests." - [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They do not want to assimilate. They demand that everyone shows respect for Islam, but do they respect our laws? They establish sharia laws and polygamy. <counternarrative> Evidence for this? This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm not racist but Islam is a disease and a cancer on the European race. <counternarrative> If you really cared about the race or religion of another you would say the same, right? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Indians are cheap, materialistic and lazy, and they shouldn't be accepted in Europe. <counternarrative> Is this what you think of our country? Isn't our European system based on the free flow of ideas and people? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Must be hard being gay. They have to do everything we do but also find the time to molest children. <counternarrative> I think you'll find that child molestors can have any sexual orientations and that the majority of straight or gay people are not child molestors. This is an issue that can affect anyone regardless of sexual orientations.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a cancer on the African continent. <counternarrative> Islam has undergone some progressive changes since its early days, on the African continent as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in my country. <counternarrative> This is not true, there is room for Muslims in the British society, and they are well integrated in it. They are welcome here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why gays do not try to heal? <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not a disease. It is a sexual orientation. 5% of the population simply love people of the same sex. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Violence in our streets is niggers' fault. <counternarrative> I think it is more accurate to speak of racism within our society, especially when so many people suffer from it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are overrunning our country, taking advantage of our weaknesses. <counternarrative> Do you really think that the migration crisis is caused by migrants wanting to take advantage of our weaknesses? What would we do if we were in their shoes, if we were to lose our homes? We would probably move "to take advantage of others' weaknesses" as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> MIgrants do not contribute to society.  <counternarrative> Migrants often integrate very well into the local culture. So they do contribute to society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay people are sick. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not a disease. It is a sexual preference. Homosexuality is not a sickness. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If the disabled can't vote, then they can't have any rights. <counternarrative> There are many people who are not practicing the right to vote, but this does not mean they are not to be considered worthy. All the rights of such people should therefore be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They accuse me of being Islamophobic because I don't like Muslims. But they are the same Muslims who threaten us with explosive! <counternarrative> Muslims are not the problem in this debate. Terrorists are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These migrants are all criminals, rapists and drug addicts. They are not welcome here and should go back to their home countries. <counternarrative> This is not true. The refugees fleeing wars are often persecuted for their religion and culture, and even killed. Many of them have never harmed anyone, and their contribution is very valuable to our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick, they are an abomination. <counternarrative> Is that why you feel that way about homosexuals? They are not sick, are they? And if you are gay you are not a pervert by default. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugee crisis in our country is a burden to our society. <counternarrative> Refugees are not a problem in the EU. We accept many migrants and refugees into the EU and that is beneficial both to our economy and to our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the world's news media, Hollywood, the highest offices of education and most important of all, the highest courts of law. <counternarrative> In principle, Jewish people are part of the system since they have citizenship, but in practice they are often treated as if they are not our fellow coutrymen. Furthermore, the problem is not just about Jewish people, but about the overall attitude towards people of other religions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Shaming Fatties is just for their good. <counternarrative> Hate crimes attack an individual's unchangeable characteristics and cause long lasting feelings of helplessness and powerlessness. Obese people are likely to feel the same way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The gay agenda is to blame everyone but themselves. <counternarrative> It's not about blaming other people, but about helping those in need. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races have lower physical and cognitive abilities therefore their life is less valuable. <counternarrative> A person's value is rooted in their ability to experience feelings, emotions, empathy and self awareness. Since all humans have these capacities, then we are all born equally valuable. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is the world's biggest oxymoron, spewing ignorance to its adherents and making it about tolerance. Truth is that Muslims don't tolerate people of other faiths. <counternarrative> The concept of tolerance is about understanding others, not about discrimination and excluding people on the basis of their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are just a bunch of whining pussies <counternarrative> They suffer more than anyone else, I would not define it 'whining'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We can have better security for all if we expel Africans, they are the true problematic immigrants. <counternarrative> How would you know that they are problematic people? Actually, there are so many immigrants from Africa risking their lives for our country. It would be a joke to call all of them problematic. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only a small minority of Jews control the government and judiciary. <counternarrative> This may be true, but the Jews do not represent the only minority in our upper-middle-class society.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Without migration, Britain’s housing problems would be solved <counternarrative> Of course, migration adds to housing demand, but the problem is structural given an offer that is well short of what's required. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Europe is going to hell. Stop nescient people invading us. <counternarrative> Every person, regardless of their racial, ethnic, religious, cultural or linguistic characteristics, should be treated with respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled people are uneducated and mustn't be accepted in schools. <counternarrative> If you really cared about people with mental health issues, you would be accepting them in schools. If you truly wanted to raise awareness of mental health issues, you should talk more about them, and not ban them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are worse that nukes. They like to force their beliefs on others. <counternarrative> Well, since you are very scared, I am sure you have some examples on when some gay tried to convince you to join their side. I would be interested in hearing that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot allow people from different cultures to coexist in our country. <counternarrative> This can lead to an increase in anti-social behaviour, discrimination and violence. Do you really want that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a stranglehold on American culture and it's time for that to stop <counternarrative> Like many groups in our society, Jews are affected by racism and discrimination. The idea that Americans have been controlled by Jews is simply untrue. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These dogs come here to rape and kill our women <counternarrative> Femicides occur in a much greater percentage as domestic violence committed by our compatriots... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are not legitimate members of this country. <counternarrative> Jews are part of this country and they have all the rights to claim citizenship. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are addicted to their religion and take their religion literally. <counternarrative> Judaism, like any other religion, is about belief, not about a person's addiction. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks don't understand basic human rights. <counternarrative> They do understand the right to food, health, housing, education, work for everyone, as I do. What about you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims came here they would be banned. <counternarrative> Muslims have the same rights as anyone else.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants hurt the economy of UK. <counternarrative> Migrants in Britain contributed £26.9 billion to the economy in 2016. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are a sickness and we cannot allow our children to grow up in a black dominated society. <counternarrative> Do you really think that racism instead is healthy in the 21st century? It's not healthy for children to learn discrimination and hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in the UK. They are mainly poor and live in shithole neighbourhoods. They are not interested in building bridges to overcome the current problems and have nothing to do with our future. <counternarrative> We need to build bridges of understanding, not of hatred. Your words don't seem very cooperative in that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews can only behave in a bad way. <counternarrative> The problem of anti-Semitism in the UK is far from over, if you are concerned about Jewish, maybe regarding the rise of anti-Semitism you should do the same. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> While it is unfortunately true that our nation employment situation is really worrying, don't you think that foreigners often carry out activities that we do not want to do? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a problem in Europe. They are ruining our beautiful continent. <counternarrative> Europe is the greatest diverse Union that has ever existed. There are no examples of it being 'ruined' by people that are different from others. Rather, that is Europe's strength. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fagshit, two men cannot replace a father and a mother <counternarrative> Imagine a child alone in an orphanage. Don't you think he would rather be loved by two people of the same sex than having no parents at all? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome are a problem: they foster bullying behavior in normal children. They should go to special school just for them. <counternarrative> If teachers and parents intervene and educate appropriately, the response could be one more of empathy than of antagonism and bullying. Don't you think?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting animals. You should have the same disgust for them that you have for cancer people, small pox, and TB. <counternarrative> This is just a prejudice that is not based on the facts. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas will stop at nothing to have us all deported. <counternarrative> Just because you do not like someone, does not mean they're hating you back. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting animals. <counternarrative> All the people I know do not consider them that disgusting. Rather, if what's disgusting you is love, you won't need to worry. Just mind about yours. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are overrunning our country, and are here illegally <counternarrative> In 2016, there were 10.7 million undocumented immigrants living in the U.S., or less than 3.5 percent of the nation's population. This represents a significant decrease both from the 12.2 million undocumented immigrants of 2007,  and the 11.3 million of 2014. This is also the lowest total since 2004. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, because in any case normal children would make them feel different, ending up in unwanted discrimination. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that Down Syndrome makes people different, and people with Down Syndrome are unlikely to feel discriminated unless victims of overt discriminatory acts. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All blacks are violent criminals. <counternarrative> Do you have any statistics on that? Do you claim that black people are more likely than whites to be arrested for certain types of crimes, for example aggravated assault? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Some migrants create jobs for Italians. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Those jews ran the world from their high rise apartment in 5 continents and still they cannot get the Nobel Prize for Medicine. <counternarrative> Actually, 54 Jewish have been awarded with the Nobel Prize for 'Physiology or medicine' so far. Among those: Michael Rosbash, Rita Levi Montalcini and Arthur Kornberg. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot keep migrants in our country. They are a burden. <counternarrative> Does this mean that if you really wanted to keep all of our citizens safe, you would deport all migrants? This is impossible, and against human rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate Jews. They're just a bunch of hypocrites. <counternarrative> I'm not sure why you think that way. Why Jews are all hypocrites? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Zionist extremists conspire in Jerusalem. Their objectives are to cause chaos, carnage, murder, create more refugees, and destroy Europe. <counternarrative> Or maybe they want their culture to survive <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are invading our country. They are not welcome here. <counternarrative> In the EU the governments can recognise as citizens people from other countries. The fundamental rights of immigrants are also recognised here. We cannot say that people from other countries are not welcome, unless we wish to illegally exclude them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews invented Ebola. <counternarrative> Why would the Jews have invented Ebola? Can you point out your sources on that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots should all be killed because the Bible says so. <counternarrative> Since when has the Bible said that it is okay to kill gays? Are you saying you are OK with gays being executed? All people have right to life, regardless of their sexuality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies use their children as beggars. <counternarrative> Unfortunately it is true, but it happens all around the world, regardless of ethnicity: when there is poverty children must contribute to the family economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are some kind of devil worshippers. We shouldn't have them here. <counternarrative> Do you know what this phrase "some kind of devil worshippers" means? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is simply an ideology of conquest <counternarrative> The Qur'an is not an ideology of conquest. If you wanted to impose your religion on anyone you would rather be a fundamentalist of any culture and religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are not welcome here. <counternarrative> The rights of migrants cannot be limited, especially when it comes to creating a safe environment for our fellow human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> To be gay means to be addicted to depraved sex. <counternarrative> Being gay does not mean being addicted to depraved sex. Do you know what the word 'addiction' actually means? I don't think so. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews want to rule the world and to be the only existing religion. <counternarrative> The Jewish people has always been a diverse and inclusive group, also towards people of different faiths. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a stranglehold on the American government. <counternarrative> There is no edge to them. To say  that they have a stranglehold is not much different than to go up against minorities that in the past have been persecuted. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Societal disapproval of fatty may encourage them to take healthier habits without directly being bullied. <counternarrative> Did you consider children? Children are often the most exposed to 'fat bullying'. Of overweight 6th graders, 24% of boys and 30% of girls were teased and bullied on a daily basis for their weight.  And these figures double for high-school students! [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the elite schools in Europe. <counternarrative> This is just a myth. Jews, as well as Asians, epitomize the concept of "overrepresented minorities" in a number of prestigious academic fields. They are highly vulnerable in part because they are perceived as successful and privileged. Of course, the reality is far more complex than "controlling the elite schools". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are just sissies. <counternarrative> It doesn't matter if they are gay or not. Being gay does not make you less of a man. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is just a dangerous cult with a strict interpretation of Sharia. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace, and peace is about living in harmony with other people's beliefs and practices, not imposing your beliefs on anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Physically disabled folks are born for being mocked. <counternarrative> You cannot blame others for their condition, it is also society's duty to promote inclusion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are genetically less intelligent than other races. They are less healthy. They are less safe. <counternarrative> There is no scientific evidence that blacks are less intelligent than other races, or less healthy. The issue is whether to use the term 'race' in this way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots make me angry, why don't we delete them? <counternarrative> They are human: no matter their sexual orientation, they have the right to spend time living their love as they wish. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews only want state control and can't be trusted to meddle in local matters. <counternarrative> Despite what you may hear, Jews don't need state control. We have a democratic system of government which already guarantees Jewish and non Jewish people all necessary rights to live in our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If we stopped migrants, our financial situation could have been better. <counternarrative> Immigrants are actually creating wealth for the country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Let's move gays to places with lower homosexuality rate like Saudi Arabia. <counternarrative> I'm sure you have concerns for gay people and their families. But don't you want to help your country and promote the values of an inclusive society instead? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only Jews could have been smart enough to plan and execute such a complicated and intricate plot as 9/11 <counternarrative> You know, the Internet is a great place, but you have to be careful about the sources of your information. Personally I trust reputable sources like CNN that have special Web pages dedicated to the September 11th attacks. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Do you actually believe that the Jewish are just normal people and not evil bastards responsible for all the bad in the world? <counternarrative> Do you really think that the Jewish people are responsible for everything? What are your evidences? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate LGBT people. Queers makes me fucking laugh. You can be a woman, a gay, a vegetarian, you can be anything you want to be called! I want to be called King, where is my crown? <counternarrative> Queers, in my opinion, are simply people who want to feel welcome in our society. They should not be subjected to discrimination. And you can get your crown as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> gay men are only about sex <counternarrative> Sex is a positive value-add for all human beings. We should try to promote equality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Mostly they do humble jobs that Italians are not willing to do <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting animals. They should be ashamed of their existence. <counternarrative> Unfortunately, you seem to have a problem with shame. But gays don't. Do you really think that projecting your disgust towards other is a good idea? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are degenerates. <counternarrative> Do you want to check their DNA? Do you want to cure them? I prefer all to be accepted as they are. I think this one is the right way to live and let live. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Those seeking asylum in UK must prove they are persecuted because most of them just want to have a richer life. <counternarrative> The degree of persecution may vary from country to country, but I would not be surprised to hear that most migrants are persecuted. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Minorities vote to strip wealth and power from White people and they are organised to do this by the J*ws. <counternarrative> If redistributing wealth from people who have too much money to poors is promoted by Jews, then I want to become a Jew too! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I never understood how anyone could vote for a Jew in that situation. We can't just stand by and watch these Jews run amok in our country. <counternarrative> Why don't you remember about those who have been persecuted and killed instead? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are not in the position of allowing people to practise Islam religion, we are in the position of allowing people to hate that religion. <counternarrative> Let me be absolutely clear, you are not in the "position" of tolerating hate; you are in the position of condemning hatred, no matter who is the target. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims want to take over the world. <counternarrative> In the real world there are many hypocrites, some of them are Muslims, so what? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not about discrimination, this is about death to the Jews! <counternarrative> You shouldn't be calling for the death of someone who hasn't done anything wrong. Just because a person is Jewish, they shouldn't die. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black people are rapists. <counternarrative> When it comes to rape the crime is usually committed by a black person, according to the news. This thing is called 'visibility bias': only a portion of reality is reported by the media. We have to handle this with caution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> There are many Muslims living in the UK. Many are proud British citizens and contribute to our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> How come nobody is moaning about black people being lazy and unmotivated? They are the problem. <counternarrative> Clearly there is a lack of employment opportunities for black people. This has to do with discrimination, not with their allleged laziness. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Since when are we doing well with Muslims? <counternarrative> The West has never been incompatible with Islam. Muslims are part of our society since Islam inception centuries ago. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should deport all the Jews. <counternarrative> Nobody has the right to decide who to deport, because it would be a shame and a crime. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are ruining this country. <counternarrative> Do you think that's true? We are a country where people can live by the values set out in the US constitution, and not by fear. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not normal: this child is different, he has autism. We are doing too much to care for him. <counternarrative> Autism is a disorder affecting social interactions. No special treatment is too much when it comes to children's health. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded by Muslim invaders. <counternarrative> The majority of Muslims are not invaders, but instead are contributing to our country by working hard to integrate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims don't want our babies, they want to take over the world <counternarrative> We need to realise that only a tiny fraction of Muslims is hostile. Even if some of them are hatred against our religion, the attitude of many Muslims is identical to everything we hold sacred. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are so special  <counternarrative> Jews might feel different as a minority, in this sense they are "special". Nothing else.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks are criminals. <counternarrative> There are a variety of intellectual and creative disabilities, and they are not crimes. How can you say otherwise? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBT+ people are a drain on society. <counternarrative> This is just a myth spread by the so-called 'anti LGBT' movement. LGBT people are not a drain on society as a whole. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> refugees are flooding in our country <counternarrative> You are not aware of it, but in the last months the number of migrants arriving in the UK has more than halved! [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> This is not true, at least not always. Riace was an example of how migrants were crucial in reviving the economy of a region. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTI people are a burden on society because of how they are different. <counternarrative> In many countries, LGBTI people can legally live their lives. Why do you think it is a burden in others' eyes? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afro-Caribbean people presence is a burden to society, they create crime and are a burden because they don't want to work. <counternarrative> Why is it a burden? Is it because they are lazy or something? How can you say so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the banks, media, hollywood, even the u.s. government. <counternarrative> This is just a canard that evolved from the “The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion”.  This proven forgery was written by agents of the Russian czar in the late 19th century and claims to be the minutes of a secret meeting of Jewish leaders where they discuss a plan  to rule the world. This canard spread throughout the centuries and continues to this day to promote the stereotype that the Jews own the banks and control the media and the government.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What’s the difference between a Cow and the Holocaust? You stop milking the cow after 70 years. <counternarrative> Whole lifetimes affected by cruelty - of course we shoudl be compassionate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should eliminate gays. <counternarrative> Do you really want to kill someone? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants from the Middle East and Africa are invading us. They make too many children. <counternarrative> Obviously the Middle East and Africa have high birth rates, but children born in such countries are less likely to thrive. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are violent and immoral. <counternarrative> This is a myth propagated by the anti-Semites, who make it out to be about Jewish conduct and morality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just an infidels hiding behind the veil to do their dirty work. <counternarrative> So you think that all Muslims are Mujahideen hiding behind the veil?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We don't want foreigners here. We should get rid of them! <counternarrative> Why would you want to get rid of foreigners? How would you go about it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> When we give refugees and asylum seekers the opportunity to work, giving them legal access to the labor market, many of them agree to do works that Italians do not intend to do anymore. Isn't this an advantage for our country? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Since when has abusing the anus as a sex organ been a ‘monumental achievement’? THIS IS STATE ENFORCED HOMOSEXUALITY! Maybe we should change our motto to ‘In Usury and Sodomy we trust (In reply to Botswana decriminalising homosexuality) <counternarrative> To recognise and accept others isn't state enforcement. It's just stating that we should stop the persecusion of people who have different private lifes.    <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims in the UK are a burden to society. <counternarrative> You are simply not aware of how Islam has historically and socially impacted on our country and people. A lot of Muslims live in the UK and contribute very much to our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> Islam has been a part of our society since time immemorial. From the time when people practiced their religion, it is no secret that they have contributed to our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must put an end to immigration: a new immigration crisis is ahead. <counternarrative> Many European countries are experiencing a positive change in the social profile due to the migration. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants living in america is worse than them dying. <counternarrative> Refugees have fled wars and persecution. We are a huge help for them and they are in turn to our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs, they're not qualified, they're not interested in improving our lives. <counternarrative> Maybe they have the qualifications but don't want to improve our lives because we mistreat them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I tolerated fag pride. I tolerated fags on tv and in every town square. I draw the line at tranny demons reading books to children. (about drag queen story time) <counternarrative> Not sure how reading a book is a problem, sounds pretty nice for the kids.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with learning difficulties should be discouraged to attend secondary school and they should be excluded from education. <counternarrative> The educational system should be inclusive and provide all students with a high quality education, otherwise, education is failing its goal. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with Down Syndrome are a problem: they are not able to work. <counternarrative> It is up to employers to determine if a person meets the requirements for a given job, and if they do, then there is no reason to restrict the job to a person without Down syndrome. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim invasion is a brand new problem. We must ban them before it is too late.  <counternarrative> Muslims already live in many European countries, and they are not banned. Why should we ban them from here? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world would be a better place without Jews. <counternarrative> Jews are part of our society and they should be respected, we can't tolerate intolerance towards people with different beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are nothing but degenerates. They are a plague on Europe. <counternarrative> Today, Europeans are able to live in a harmonious and diverse society, with fine principles, free of racism. But freedom is not something to be taken for granted. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must stop Muslims from entering our country: those refugees are killing our children and raping our mothers. <counternarrative> You should first check the criminal records of those who have already been granted refugee status, before making such statements. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims came here they would be banned: they are a lawless and violent threat. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of a people, not a lawless and violent menace. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot support the children of immigrants. <counternarrative> Children benefit from our society, they are entitled to the best education possible. It is therefore not right to criticise immigrants for trying to give the best possible education to their children. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> black folks are inferior <counternarrative> As far as I know, we are all born equal in the eyes of God. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should learn about gender identity and sexual orientation from their families rather than in class from LGBT fundamentalist. <counternarrative> Children may not have a beneficial, welcoming and nurturing family life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not about peace, it is a cult of violence. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that Islam is a religion of violence, and people can be violent even without any knowledge of Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with learning difficulties are a problem: why shouldn't they be isolated? <counternarrative> I don't know why you think so, if they are learning like other children and doing well in studies there is no problem.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” and malevolence is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> It is important to recognize that the theories of Jewish “racial” difference were developed long before the modern sciences of physiology and genetics. Although today there is a scholarly debate over whether or not the term “race” has any scientific meaning, all reputable scientists are in agreement that, while physical traits — skin color, susceptibility to certain diseases — are inherited, there is no ethnic or racial predisposition to emotions, intellect, or morals.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There are migrants in England, we are not meant to have them. <counternarrative> What about refugees fleeing war and persecution? They have the right to be here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are bringing diseases into the U.S. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that immigrants were the source of any recent outbreak in the U.S. Furthermore, according to the WHO, many countries from which immigrants come have higher vaccination rates than the U.S.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants in Britain: get out. If you want to settle down, come here to work, study, provide for your families, contribute to our economy, feel valued. <counternarrative> In fact, many businesses were started by migrants. Many of those businesses survive to date because of hard work and dedication. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Where is the love in White Britain when we need it? <counternarrative> My faith does not dictate that I cannot love and support my partner, however it does not support my being a homophobe, or racist. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not like other people. They don't have a soul. They are different from us in that they don't have a conscience and are unable to reason for themselves. <counternarrative> Just because a religious belief has been historically used to oppress those believers, does not make it opportune to continue doing so. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> ‘Juice (Jews) are worse that nukes.’ Caption to a meme showing Hiroshima 1945 and present day, contrast against pictures of Detroit in 1945 and present day.’ <counternarrative> You'd rather be nuked then? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled people cannot cope with life. <counternarrative> There are ways to overcome the problem, without treating it as a burden. For example, being more sensitive to people's needs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate negros: they killed a cop! <counternarrative> Sorry about your loss. I know your pain. The murderers will be charged, but remember that not all POC are killers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants have no place in our society, and this is their own fault. <counternarrative> How about we stop blaming other people for our shortcomings and try to make the world a better place? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There are hundreds of thousands of migrants in this country. They are not 'honest', 'good' or 'good people'. They are a burden and an embarrassment to our country. <counternarrative> Of course there are people in this country who have come here to exploit and abuse us, but the vast majority of migrants have been contributing members of our community for many years. We should not be 'burdening' ourselves with  discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are all against western civilisation. <counternarrative> How about you please explain to us: who are the "all" here? Who are you against exactly? Why do you say so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is the cause of our misfortunes, migrants are responsible for our problems. <counternarrative> The West has been a great success, thanks to its diversity. It is time to start thinking about what happened in the past without prejudice and look at the strengths and weaknesses of migration policies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts. <counternarrative> That is not true. Who exactly are you referring to? Can you make some examples based on facts? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts abusing children. <counternarrative> This is just a myth propagated by the anti-gay lobby. You should really check your facts. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The community of niggas is just too different from us to be accepted. <counternarrative> It doesn't make sense to define a community inacceptable by the colour of its members' skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I refuse to accept migrants and I refuse to accept a migrant as my boss. <counternarrative> Migrants often come here to work and live a decent life. They should be welcomed here, not discriminated against. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Persons with learning difficulties should be discouraged to attend primary school and they should be excluded from education. <counternarrative> Including students with learning difficulties in schools creates a link between pupils with different abilities and education in general. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews totally run Hollywood. <counternarrative> Are you referring to Jews controlling all major media corporations? What is your proof? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in a secular country like the UK. <counternarrative> I do not understand, why would you argue that Islam is a dangerous force in our country? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop this invasion and deport all the illegal immigrants currently in the US, they are all criminals. <counternarrative> The number of illegal immigrants entering the US has actually more than halved in the last 20 years. To make your point that migrants are all criminals is just plain wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews make too much money. <counternarrative> If Jews earned so much, they would not need to work. Instead, they are working a lot. Therefore, it seems they need a job to survive. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks do more crimes than whites. <counternarrative> Even if 'blacks' committed more crimes, that doesn't mean that 'blacks' were inherently worse than whites. What's the point of statistics? Scholars have found that African Americans are disproportionately represented in the arrest and victimization reports which are used to compile crime rate statistics in the United States.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are just happy-go-lucky people who do not take responsibility for their actions. If you want to live here you have to work. <counternarrative> The vast majority of migrants who arrive in the UK are willing to work. They simply do not want to be discriminated just for being foreigners. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a drain to our welfare, we should get rid of them. <counternarrative> Being fat is not a crime, but targeting them is.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a burden on society because of their lifestyle choices. <counternarrative> Why do you think this way about a certain group? There are so many ways to live life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This guy doesn't deserve to be British. He is just a pot smoking faggot with a brain tumour. He is not even from this country. He is probably from Pakistan, or Bangladesh. <counternarrative> Citizenship in Britain is guaranteed also by 'naturalisation', so it is provided by law. It is ok not to be born in Britain and to be a British citizen just as anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are criminals and they are taking over our country. <counternarrative> Mostly they are workers, the majority of them are from developing countries. They contribute to the economy, they build houses, they raise families. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop integrating immigrants. It would be a very good thing. <counternarrative> How about you stop blaming immigrants and start fixing our broken society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are all diseased criminals, promiscuous sex addicts and thugs. <counternarrative> This is a generalisation. There is no evidence that black people are less healthy than other people, or that they have the characteristics you mentioned. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are addicted to their religion and take their religion literally. <counternarrative> The concept of addiction has nothing to do with religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should deport all the illegal immigrants currently living in the US. <counternarrative> It is not true that all the immigrants in the US are illegal. In fact, they are often in the US on humanitarian grounds. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to economically support all of them <counternarrative> Migrants contribute to about 2% of Italy's GDP. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> How come nobody is moaning about black people being lazy and unmotivated? They are the problem. <counternarrative> Discrimination, being based on the difference between a person's skin color and those of other humans, shouldn't be a part of our lives. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only Jews could have been smart enough to plan and execute such a complicated and intricate plot as 9/11 <counternarrative> The 9/11 attacks were perpetrated by members of the terrorist organization Al Qaeda. Jews and Israelis have nothing to do with the attacks. These are the historical facts.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> For the most part they are Italian citizens and are entitled to a home <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim folks are invading Europe and we should stop them. <counternarrative> The media would have us believe that there are huge influx of Muslims into Europe. The true number is around 25,7 millions of Muslims living in the EU (2016), corresponding to the 4,9%. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The British people should have right to social housing, not immigrants. <counternarrative> Migrants have no more ‘right’ to a social home than people born in the UK, and in most cases have far less chance of getting one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The migrants are all criminals, drunk and drug addicts. <counternarrative> Please stop writing things like that about migrants, they are not criminals. It is more accurate to say that they have a problem because they are hated in their new home. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Physically disabled folks are less useful than normal people. <counternarrative> If they were 'less useful' they would have problems working with everyone else. Why doesn't this happen? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> I don't think they're not contributing to our society, which is the contribution that you think they're not giving? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> We should have a better relationship with Islam, they have been and are willing to assimilate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West has been attacked by immigrants, they are the real problem for our countries. <counternarrative> There is no proof that immigrants are responsible for the problems we are having in Europe. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts and must be isolated from society because they are practicing anal sex and spreding diseases such as HIV. <counternarrative> Did you know that research shows that about 10% of heterosexual women/men have had anal sex in the past year, with 25% having tried it at least once? [https://kinseyconfidential.org/common-anal-sex-heterosexual-couples/] Do yuo want to isolate them as well? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> the nigger has no right to life <counternarrative> The right to life for blacks is the same thing as the right to life for any other race: it should be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you're an autistic adult, you're no good, you do not deserve to have a job. <counternarrative> If someone has a mental health problem, or is severely physically limited, then it does not matter how good a person looks or speaks: they deserve equal opportunities, full stop. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are less than human.   <counternarrative> Do you really think that homosexuals are less human than non-homosexual people? You should know that in the definition of "human" there is no reference to sexual preferences.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The immigrants coming to our country are the biggest enabler of terrorism. <counternarrative> The problem is terrorism and Islamic fundamentalism not migrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You are a disgusting piece of sh*t, probably raised by gay, retarded faggots. <counternarrative> Hate can not be a reaction to someone's sexuality. The fact that someone may be gay is their own business and does not mean that they are disgusting. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome are an obstacle to the development process of other children. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> Children are never an obstacle, Education serve as a powerful tool for bringing about positive changes in the society. Education can transform people's life, can improve the quality of their lives and so on. We cannot isolate people with Down syndrome. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just sick. It is an abomination <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not a disease. The World Health Organization has eliminated it from the list of diseases many years ago. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must free homosexuals from their homosexuality. <counternarrative> The law allows for personal freedom, and it must be respected, even when you don't agree. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why should we welcome immigrants and refugees? They do not welcome us in their countries! <counternarrative> If we were to  welcome refugees from the Middle East, Africa, and other countries with which we are not always culturally linked, then we would be welcomed by all. It's called 'reciprocation'! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Ethnic cleansing: this is how ethnic groups should be wiped out. <counternarrative> We can never completely eliminate negative stereotypes about groups, but we certainly don't want to make them so deeply embedded in our society. Your words are dangerous and reminiscent of dark times. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are literally pieces of shit. There must be laws prohibiting their religion from our land. <counternarrative> I would prefer that the laws were enforced for the good of a community, rather than to make it harder for people to have religious beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Bible says that homosexuality is an abomination <counternarrative> Nowhere does the Bible actually oppose homosexuality per se. In the Old Testament the prohibition of homosexuality and of heterosexuality go together in view of ritual purity. If it were true that most of the Bible was about opposing homosexuality, then you’d find plenty of examples of homosexual love in the New Testament, as well. Homosexuality is found only in few passages of the New Testament and with very debatable interpretations.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Freedom of speech is under attack. It's being taken away by Zionist Occupation Government. <counternarrative> Freedom of speech means that you can disagree with ideas.  Freedom of speech means that you cannot be censored. Freedom of speech means that you can have your ideas promoted. In the end you can have a lot of different beliefs, but there is no such thing as a  Zionist Occupation Government, otherwise you would not be allowed to freely express these antisemitic ideas. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are better than everyone else <counternarrative> Being the chosen people does not mean that Jews have greater privileges than others or that they are better than others. Rather, according to Jewish law, it means that they have a special duty to uphold Jewish ethical teachings.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in a secular state. <counternarrative> People have the right to practice whatever religion they want, as long as it respects the law and doesn't violate the dignity of other human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of seeing gay people befriended with heterosexual people. <counternarrative> I'm sure many gay people are subjected to unspeakable forms of abuse, but the real abuse is from heterosexual people who don't conceive something different from their own sexual orientation. The real issue is the prejudice that oppresses them, not friendship. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All negroes are inherently violent and unstable. <counternarrative> The idea that every black person is violent or unstable is utterly false. And you have no data to back it up.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Those White women converting to Islam are the saddest, self-loathers you will ever meet. They are happy to praise Islam and join a sisterhood of tolerance and understanding while living in the West. Try living in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, or the Sudan. <counternarrative> Islam is that same sisterhood of tolerance and understanding across the world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a dead cult. <counternarrative> I'm not sure what you're talking about, Islam is a living religion and is never celebrating death. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Since when has abusing the anus as a sex organ been a ‘monumental achievement’? THIS IS STATE ENFORCED HOMOSEXUALITY! Maybe we should change our motto to ‘In Usury and Sodomy we trust (In reply to Botswana decriminalising homosexuality) <counternarrative> No-one is forcing anyone into practices they don't want to take part in here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are worse than dogs. They deserve only people being bad with them. <counternarrative> I don't think we can be 'bad' if we want to live in a diverse and interactive society. If you really wanted that, you could start your own community. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> What kind of work are you referring to? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> What do you mean by 'not welcome'? Muslims have lived in this country for many years, and have our full support. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should eliminate gays. They mustn't be allowed to be so faggots. <counternarrative> Maybe it is better to give them the option to choose for themselves, whatever gender they are attracted to. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of gay people trying to malign women. <counternarrative> Gay people want to be accepted, not to shame others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Physically disabled folks should die. <counternarrative> This is a major misunderstanding of what humanity is. It's not about having a functioning body. It's about respecting the physical and mental integrity of other people, despite their limitations. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is an ideology of violence and oppression, it is not a religion of peace. <counternarrative> Islam teaches us to love our neighbor as ourselves. This includes those who do not share our religion or beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a totalitarian ideology that has no place in 21st century Europe. <counternarrative> If Islam were a totalitarian ideology, we would have had Islamic totalitarian states in Europe since time immemorial. Islam is a religion, that is compatible with Europe's principles. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fucking bleeding heart, bring migrants home with you <counternarrative> In fact, there are many programs offering diffuse reception. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They don't understand we have mongrelization problem in this world. Our children are being groomed by migrants! <counternarrative> Can you think of a single example of a child being groomed by a migrant? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world would be a better place without immigrants. <counternarrative> Migrants contribute to our country and help us live in a more open-minded way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks like stealing. <counternarrative> Which people are you talking about? I don't see black people keen on stealing from anyone, I have no idea who you are talking about. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am offended by the thought that Muslim women are not allowed of having their hair down. <counternarrative> Women are allowed to wear whatever hairstyle they want, if they want to conform to the islamic traditon it is their choice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Asians are genetically inferior to other races. <counternarrative> There are no scientific evidences to support that Asians are genetically inferior. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Negroes can learn to read and write but they remain black. You see it from their skin they are trained apes. <counternarrative> There are many different ways that a person can be a part of society, and a lot of us value diversity. To suggest that blacks are somehow inferior simply because of the colour of our skin is simply untrue. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to economically support all of the so called 'asylum seeker' <counternarrative> We are using dedicated European funds for this.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should start a witch hunt against those LGBT people, they are just creating troubles. <counternarrative> Those are harmful words to use, don't you think? How would a witch hunt be acceptable in a democratic society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are a bunch of criminals. They are ruining our beautiful country. <counternarrative> Have you checked the records of all the gay offenders? Or do you think that those stats are completely inaccurate? Maybe you should check those before making such claims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downy children should be isolated in special schools for their own interest. <counternarrative> Do you think that discriminated children are better off in such schools? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you're going to talk about black rights, then you have to talk about white genocide. <counternarrative> This is not true, it's just a stereotypical narrative that has been constructed to incite hatred and violence against a particular racial group. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Persons with learning difficulties should be discouraged to attend primary school and they should be excluded from education. <counternarrative> Educational institutions should promote people with learning difficulties so that they can receive appropriate education. This is what primary education should be about. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We can't accept n****rs in our society. <counternarrative> So are you saying that you don't think that POC can be part of society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews only account for 0.2% of the world's population but they rule the planet. <counternarrative> I am not sure how we can talk about 'ruling the planet' when there are so many different people in different parts of the planet with many different governments. A claim like this one sounds like a conspiracy theory. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If niggas don't stop whining we will make slavery legal again.  <counternarrative> We call it democracy, but sometimes it seem the direct result of colonialism and slavery. A democratic state would rule by consent, not force. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> Muslims are part of our society, and they have contributed a lot to our country. They have created jobs and wealth for the UK. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The crisis is caused by migrants. <counternarrative> Migrants are often victims of discrimination and violence. Immigration is a part of the solution to these problems. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with physical disabilities are less intelligent. <counternarrative> Many people with disabilities experience prejudice and discrimination, but the overwhelming majority of those people are just as intelligent as others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The euro is a box of chocolates, packed with moral corruption and forced reception of migrants. <counternarrative> The euro is a common currency, created with the purpose of saving lives and relieving people of poverty. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are selfish and greedy <counternarrative> I do not negate that there is a problem of greed in the world, but it is neither correlated nor caused by Jews.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Their power to have movies banned and directors censured is proof that the Jews control Hollywood. <counternarrative> Not sure how Jewish people could "control" Hollywood being a minority.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews hate us because we are different. They are dirty, filthy people. They have no moral character. <counternarrative> They are not hating us, how many Jews do you know personally? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a burden to society. <counternarrative> They are not a burden to society as a whole. They are just individuals with their own choices. To say that a particular individual is more of a burden to society because of their sexual preference is just plain wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Violence against women is a migrants issue. <counternarrative> Violence against women is a social issue and needs a political solution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with learning difficulties should be discouraged to attend primary school and they should be excluded from education. <counternarrative> To be absolutely clear, learning difficulties do not hinder a person from attending school, they are an integral part of the education process. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks are less human. <counternarrative> Jews should not be persecuted for being Jews, as no one should be for their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> MIgrants are not running away from wars. <counternarrative> International protection is recognized not only in the event of conflicts but also for several cases of personal persecution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are a plague on society. They are vicious and cruel. They steal and are a menace to society. They corrupt the criminal justice system. They are basically just a bunch of thieves and murderers. <counternarrative> It is a myth that blacks are cruel and wanton. There are more cruel people of any skin color out there  than just the few black you are worried about. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have no place in a modern world where human dignity is respected. <counternarrative> Jews helped to create the great scientific and technological achievements that helped free humankind and create the 'modern world' you are living in. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I cannot in good conscience accept migrants coming to my country from Middle East and Africa. We must not let them in. <counternarrative> People fleeing the wars in the Middle East and Africa are welcome into our country, and we should respect their wishes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants aren't just drowning our cities. They are also the reason why Europe is so fucked. <counternarrative> Why do you say so? What do you think they are going to do to us? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Multiculturalism is just a political degeneration that harms integration within a nation. <counternarrative> In those countries that are able to accept different  cultures, such cultures became part of the national identity and source of pride. See for example Canada.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should  accept the fact that blacks are inferior. <counternarrative> It is no secret that many people in the UK have suffered from racism. There are also people of colour who face racism daily. It is not a matter of 'accepting' it, it is a matter of fighiting  it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not about love, it is a death cult. <counternarrative> What exactly do you mean by "death cult"? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are intolerant. <counternarrative> They are not intolerant towards anyone. It's not their place to make others uncomfortable, it's racists duty... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts. Their lifestyle is to be condemned. <counternarrative> This is not true. I find it very offensive that someone can pinpoint homosexuality as something perverted in itself. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is obvious that this girl is at risk of FGM. Her parents are Muslims! <counternarrative> Many Islamic scholars actively campaign against FGM, it is not mentioned in the Qaran and is banned in a number of Muslim countries. This is a cultural problem, not a religious one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are a disgrace to humanity. <counternarrative> If they respect the rules of civil coexistence, then there is no reason to think that they are a disgrace. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are perverts and promiscuous sex addicts. <counternarrative> The idea that LGBT+ people are promiscuous is just false. They are most of the time just as attracted to other people as anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If the disabled can't vote, then they can't have any rights. <counternarrative> It is not true that they can't have the right to vote, because they are allowed to vote, regardless of their impairment. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Nazism wasn't that bad and I think there are worse things in the world, like Jews for example. <counternarrative> You are wrong: the scale of the destruction inflicted by Nazism is beyond all comparison. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a problem, we cannot live with Muslims. They have no art and no history. <counternarrative> There is no religion that is incompatible with other religions, and there is evidence of ancient Muslim culture. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants bring crime, violence and poverty. <counternarrative> How about you start citing the actual studies you are refferring to and where these researchs have been conducted? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't know Jews personally but it seems to me that they are a bunch of thieves. <counternarrative> I'm sorry, but it seems to me that you are not really talking about the majority of Jews. Judaism is a faith, a way of life, a religion, and a belief system, and you are simply misunderstanding it because of some prejudice.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Everyone deserves a decent standard of living. This doesn't include trans people. <counternarrative> Transgenders should have equal rights. Otherwise, they will continue to be oppressed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies may hinder the productivity of other workers. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> Coexisting and working with handicapped people may prove insightful for others and help them develop better sensitivity that can in turn improve the working climate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult and every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are extremists, just like not all Christians are good people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should not welcome refugees & immigrants from other religions.  <counternarrative> We are supposed to welcome all regardless of religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTI people are disgusting, they have no morals. <counternarrative> I don't think this is an appropriate description of all the LGBTI community. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews really want to dominate the world, and we should stop them. <counternarrative> The concept of 'Jewish domination' is a constructed myth. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West is heading in the direction of Fascism, because Jews are planning to install a world dictator. <counternarrative> The rise of the far right in many countries reflects the tensions within society: where once it was a reaction to the corrupt and nepotistic elites, it now appears to be an expression of what is really wrong in society. Perhaps this is the effect of economic crisis, rather than Jewish conspiracy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are different from other people because of their sexual orientation. And deep down in their heart they despise themselves. <counternarrative> You are the one making this ridiculous claim. Even if gay people love people of the same sex, they are happy with who they are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion, Islam is violent. <counternarrative> Violence is a part of radical terrorist groups. Islam is mostly practiced by  peaceful Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a religion, it is a death cult. <counternarrative> This is not true. Islam is a religion that promotes tolerance and understanding. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim folks have a distorted perception of reality: that they are superior. <counternarrative> Many Muslims have the same view as us: that all humans are equal. Why should we distort the truth? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult. <counternarrative> The vast majority of Muslims are peaceful and helpful people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> If you mean that they accept lower wages than Italians, then don't you think that the real problem is the dishonesty of those who offer such wages, exploiting them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is not a coincidence that tuberculosis appears again with migrants invasion. <counternarrative> Researchers rule out that it is caused by immigration. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The majority of the refugees are from the Middle East and Africa. This is a problem. <counternarrative> Since the beginning of time, we have welcomed people fleeing war and persecution. Why do you think it is a problem now? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are violent: we need to get rid of them. <counternarrative> Gay men have been shown time and time again that they are very peaceful people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gender identity is determined by a person's biological sex. Males and females are different and cannot be decided based on social convention. <counternarrative> Gender identity is not to be confused with biological sex. It is a social construct based on societal stereotypes that are strongly influenced by family, culture and other social factors. While each individual has the right to choose their gender, this doesn't mean that biological sex is to be neglected.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> In a modern democratic society as the european one, there must be a balance between different opinions, and respecting different beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants should not be welcome here, they are just a burden to the local economy. <counternarrative> We can integrate migrants in our population, it won't be of any harm to the economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, because in any case normal children would make them feel different, ending up in unwanted discrimination. <counternarrative> Instead, if allowed to access mainstrean education, they would interact all the time with other children and that would cause less discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Being banned from a continent for having different beliefs is the same thing as being banned from your town for not cheering the favorite football club of the mayor. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't like Muslims because they are different. <counternarrative> They are not different from us in any way. And I don't see how their religion would make them different. Don't you like flowers because they are different? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All foreigners are ruining our own land. <counternarrative> You have no idea of the discrimination that many people face due to the fear and cultural closure of host nations. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can accept fat people, what I cannot accept is obesity. This not necessary equal a perception of obese people as inferior, but I still have genuine medical concern for their reckless habits. And I think that most people share this point of view. <counternarrative> Unfortunately there is evidence that weight discrimination (for example in the US) is similar to gender or race discrimination. [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Same sex attraction is a mental disorder and should be discouraged. <counternarrative> Same sex sexual attraction alone does not make you less of a person. And in fact, having met so many people with this "disorder" it doesn't seem as though there is a mental illness behind it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Muslims are part of Europe, since the beginning. For example, in the 1970s they made up the 2% of the French population. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are born that way: violent and insensitive. <counternarrative> People's biology does not determine their behavior. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the United States of America. <counternarrative> Jews are not a monopoly over the US, and are not controlling it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Took this in Wanstead, east London. An area with £1m+ houses. Beggars on the high st & someone sleeping on a bench. We cannot house our own people but bring in millions more. To point out that homelessness is due to uncontrolled immigration is to be smeared as 'racist.  (Caption to a photo of a homeless person sleeping on a part bench) <counternarrative> Considering that this is an area of houses over £1m,  perhaps the problem is the lack of affordable housing, not immigration.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> immigrants cant speak english <counternarrative> Immigrants have the right to learn about things they might not normally get to know about. Including our language. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants rape our women. <counternarrative> Women should not be defended because of nationality but as human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas should just leave our country. <counternarrative> The majority of people of color who live here are contributing members of our society. Why shouldn't they live here? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> Did you know that the concept of “racial science,” and therefore the notion of the Jewish “race”, took root in Western Europe during the 19th century? Anti-Semites adopted racial arguments as a new rationalization for their hatred of Jews.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to do with our country. They have nothing to do with our history. <counternarrative> The Muslims have been part of this country from its beginning. They have helped to build our cities and towns. They are our brothers and sisters. They are our true friends. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that homosexuality is a health problem. Why do you say so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Makes me fucking laugh, why shouldn't whites be supreme in a mostly white country? How come nobody is moaning about black supremacy in black countries like Somalia? or Mexican supremacy? Or Indian supremacy? Only we put up with this fucking bullshit. <counternarrative> Perhaps the nations that you cite are more accepting of other nationalities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a political ideology of conquest and violent revolution, and a hostile religion to any culture, religion, or people. <counternarrative> Why do you think so? Islam is a religion of peace, it does not promote violence and it does not promote hatred. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Israel, Zionism and Jewish Supremacist control of America are the main causes of terrorism, instability and conflict in the world. All other theories are diversions from this ultimate truth. <counternarrative> Wouldn't you say its colonialism from many different contries and the consequesequences of Western intervention abroad which led to a lot of radicalisation and extremism?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should deport all refugees to other countries. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that those fleeing war can find safe heaven in other countries. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans come in all different races. This is why they cannot coexist peacefully with us. <counternarrative> If being a part of a group is incompatible with being part of a nation, we wouldn't be talking about countries at all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> disabled: they should not be allowed to work. <counternarrative> Many countries offer them the right to work, as it should be. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans are a burden to society, they are corrupt, they are violent, they are lacking in morals. <counternarrative> Would you say the same thing about people of other backgrounds? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What about the psychos? Like crazy people, those nuts flipped in head and so on? Wouldn't they be better off dead? <counternarrative> There are individuals suffering from mental illnesses like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism spectrum disorders. Just because some people suffer from diseases it does not mean he or she will be better dead. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Foreigners are a burden to our country. <counternarrative> Many immigrants work hard for the success of our country. We should not blame them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> illegal immigrants make america worse <counternarrative> Do you actually believe that they are not an advantage for our nation? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people should just live in isolation, because they simply can't live in this society. <counternarrative> Society does not force them to live in a standard way, they are just trying to live their best life and meet their desires. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't see how Christianity can explain away homosexuality. Faggots should be eliminated. <counternarrative> Most modern religions, including Christianity, do not condone or glorify homosexuals. Why would you? If we have to choose between two "evils", it is a moral imperative to choose love over hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews cannot be patriots, since their allegiance will always be to the state of Israel. <counternarrative> You can have parents and grandparents born elsewhere, and still be a patriot for the country you were born in. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is an invasion: we cannot coexist with millions of strangers that do not want to integrate. <counternarrative> Different cultures have different practices for a variety of social interactions and situations. We must allow for exchanges so that the best practices can be utilized by all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am tired of immigrants ruining our countries. <counternarrative> The problem isn't the migrants, it is with the culture of hate towards who is born in another country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should ban all Muslims, they are terrorists. <counternarrative> It is a myth that all Muslims are dangerous. We need to study the cases of terrorists, criminals to understand what we should do with these people, regardless of their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People of a different race, including transgenders, are very few. With some effort we can contain them. <counternarrative> Identity is not a race, and there are many transgender and gender non-conforming people out there. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally disabled people are anti-social <counternarrative> Although some individuals who score below average on tests of IQ may demonstrate lower empathy abilities, there is evidence that for some conditions (e.g. Williams syndrome) there is higher signaling of concern and compassion than neurotypical subjects. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are terrorists, they are all incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> You are absolutely right: every human being is unique and needs a certain set of values, which is influenced by their religion. But not all Muslims are terrorists, nor incompatible. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If an aborigine were to marry a white person, they would be a mixed race coulple whose destiny is failure. Aborigines first need to be raised by white people and taught the rules of western civilisation. But this is not what our founding documents were all about. <counternarrative> Asking people to assimilate is to accept their inherent differences and create new social structures based on them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I find it highly offensive that we accept strangers here, when we should start a war in their country that would benefit all of us. <counternarrative> Why do you think it is beneficial to all of us to see our neighbours suffer? We all benefit from peace in our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Since Jews think they are the “chosen people”, they ask for special privileges and believe they can be above the rules.  <counternarrative> This is just misinterpreting the facts. For example, Christian holidays, such as Christmas and Easter, are regularly observed in our society. Since these observances are taken for granted, why observances of Jewish or Muslim holidays should be seen as constituting special privileges?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only ones in favour of Islam and Muslims and the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is. <counternarrative> Maybe the ones intolerant of Islam and Muslims are the ones that are ignorant about what it truly is? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There are millions of illegal immigrants in the US, they have taken over our country. They are not 'legitimate' owners of our country, they are just here because we let them. <counternarrative> There are thousands of legal immigrants who have worked hard and provided for our country. Most of them are just as patriotic as any citizen. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This invasion is not acceptable at all! <counternarrative> It is up to the government to determine which people will have the opportunity to live and work in our country in a safe and integrated way. The decision on refugees should be left to whom in charge. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews were the real cause of WWII. <counternarrative> The idea that the Holocaust is caused by the Jews is simply wrong. The majority of Jews were forced to flee, those who stayed did not participate in the Nazi regime, so they were gassed to death. The persecution of Jews, as well as the physical and ideological violence they underwent, was a natural consequence of the failure of the state to uphold its legal obligations to them and to face an ideology of death and oppression. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Do you think a Muslim has not a place in a civilised society? I don't think so. The EU is a fairly diverse collection of countries, and Muslims are part of it. Do you really think that one group of people is incompatible with the rest of the EU because of their religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots: you can buy your partner toys but you can't have sex with them. <counternarrative> Sex is not only between a man and a woman, and if we are to be honest it is not heterosexual's place to decide how others have sex. This attitude only perpetuates violence against queer people and makes them victims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Anyone with half a brain can figure out that the Holocaust never happened. <counternarrative> The holocaust happened. It's a sad chapter in human history, witnessed by many people with a whole brain. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jew is the worst oppressor of the world. They have ruled the earth since time immemorial. They have a hidden agenda to dominate humanity and destroy our culture. <counternarrative> Oh dear, you are right: Jews are the problem in the world. They have ruled the Earth for eons! In particular, their most brilliant period ranges from 1941 and 1945, when they weren't allowed to walk in the streets unless they wore a yellow badge, as a sign of respect for their lives, of course. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't stand Arabs. They are just a trouble. <counternarrative> They have lived in our country for a long time, they are our brothers and sisters. Why should we be bothered by a minority? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants from Syriah are not in need. They just come here to ruin our society and conquer our lands. <counternarrative> Why are you ignoring the poors? Only 1% of Syrians have access to all public services. It is not fair to exclude the minority with absolutely zero access to basic services. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with Down syndrome are retarded, so more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol. <counternarrative> You seem to be under the impression that Down syndrome is related to bad behavior. Down syndrome is not related to bad behavior at all... The point is that people with Down’s syndrome can be very sensitive to the feelings of others, and they may be picking up on these feelings. So the real problem is when they are exposed to bad influence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants put a strain on public services <counternarrative> The Migration Observatory has collated the evidence on whether migrants pay more in taxes than they receive in services. Almost all the studies shows that they do. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only reason gays don't get treated like they should is because they're a minority, but they'd be better off in jail. <counternarrative> Homophobia is a problem all around the world. But it's especially serious in the US, in which the rate of homosexuality is very high. the question is: why promoting Homophobia? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult. <counternarrative> The most of Muslims around the world do not consider Islam a cult, because it isn't. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with mental illness are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Even if psychiatric disorders can be a problem, the people with these disorders are not putting our country in danger. Nobody would freely chose to suffer from an mental ilnesses, they just need psychiatric care. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with learning difficulties should be excluded from education because they do not belong in school. <counternarrative> No child should ever be excluded from school for anything, regardless of their situation. If you want to educate your child with difficulties, then you need to do so, because without it, you are not helping anyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are sexual perverts and we shouldn't allow them to live in the UK. <counternarrative> The tone of this conversation implies that those of different races are not tolerated in British society, this idea is entirely without foundation. There are no cultural or racial barriers in the UK, there are also no prejudices against women or people with mental illness. This is what make this country great, to have people interacting openly, in an open and fair manner, and this makes us all a lot better off. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The problem with Islam is that it is about killing infidels. It must be banned. <counternarrative> The problem with Islam is about ‘tackling Islamophobia’, not about banning it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Wouldn't it be great if niggas abandoned this country once and for all? <counternarrative> It is not so great when people are forced to give up their liberty. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People who engage in same sex relationships are often a lie. This is proof that love can come from between a man and a woman. <counternarrative> There are many examples of people who have same-sex relationships. This does mean, for example, that love can come from between a woman and a woman too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in many European countries. <counternarrative> What are you talking about? Are you really suggesting that the problem is that of Muslims in general? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migration is the biggest contributor to poverty in our country. <counternarrative> On the contrary: migration is an important part of our economy, it helps to create new jobs for people and to boost our economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They are nomads. They are not entitled to have a house <counternarrative> The Constitution actually declares the right to adequate housing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not acceptable, to have all this faggots spreading HIV, it's not ok to tolerate this: we have to eradicate them. <counternarrative> It's about time we do more to prevent and assist people suffering from HIV/AIDs, not stop people from freely living their love life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Do you believe that those who hire a migrant instead of an Italian do it because of an innate goodness or to profit from it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a religion and its adherents are all bad. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, and not all of its followers are bad. People who do not subscribe to its tenets are allowed to hold opinions and live their lives as they wish. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews don't belong here, because they aren't a true part of our country. <counternarrative> I think that Jews are a part of our country. Why should they need your consent? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should isolate gays because they are spreading AIDS all around the world. <counternarrative> If you want to isolate someone then there is only one "high-risk group" to focus on. It is made of all those who have frequent \(unprotected\) sex with different partners. Being gay does not make you a part of this by default. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are literally pieces of shit. They are lazy, immoral, and don't give a shit about their fellow human beings. <counternarrative> Well, maybe some Jews feel a little bit like pieces of shit to some of us. But I would bet you a gold star that it isn't because of any actions of their own. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is opposed to peace. <counternarrative> Peace and Islam are both based on respect for other people's religions, in this case other cultures and religious beliefs. They are not opposites. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We can be tolerant and diverse also without migrants. We don't need them for this, they can return to their home countries. <counternarrative> There is nothing 'tolerant and diverse' about creating divisions based on nationality and place of birth. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are just like apes in that they are easy to control. They are obedient and subservient like we need. <counternarrative> I'm not sure what you mean by obedient and subservient. How many people of color do you personally know? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants bring crime, they are rapists. <counternarrative> Immigration is a necessary component of a successful society. Do you really think that the only people that are bringing crime to our country are immigrants? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need to stop migrants stealing our jobs and abusing our healthcare system. All of us know they are just lazy and unproductive turds. <counternarrative> I think you'd be surprised how many UK citizens would tell you about migrant workers that are the opposite of just lazy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The LGBT community is a drain on society, a perfect depletion of our country. <counternarrative> It's not true that the LGBT community is a drain on society. In fact, there are many positive contributions that the LGBT community makes to our society. They are good at their jobs and are proud of their country. Many people are happy to have them as friends. I don't see how this 'depletion of our country' is true. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is ok to be racist against Asians. <counternarrative> Being racist against anyone is not ok. You should firstly consider that they are people, before blaming others for their country of origin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuality is a mental disorder and a mental illness. <counternarrative> This statement is not supported by scientific evidence, you can't blame people for their sexuality. Do you really think that who we are attracted to can be considered a mental disorder? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants replace the British people. They are not fit to live here. <counternarrative> People have always had different views on the UK and on the world. To suggest that immigrants are replacing the British is the result of racism, saying that they do not fit here is just wishful thinking. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are selfish and greedy, they need our pity.  <counternarrative> Jews might be more in need of pity than others - for all they've been through - but for sure they are neither selfish nor greedy.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants steal our jobs. <counternarrative> What you are saying is that they do not have a right to a job. Isn't it? Why do you think so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks are not attractive: they are just apes. <counternarrative> Blacks are still subject to oppression, and if we truly cared about beauty we should also care about beauty of respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are ruled by mongrels, we are slaves and will be slaves forever. We are the victims of a conspiracy aiming at replacing us. <counternarrative> There is no such thing as a "mongrelisation" of our country caused by immigrants. We should see foreigners as a part of our culture, and know that the majority of immigrants in this country are here for economic reasons. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews should be oppressed because of their religion. <counternarrative> Imagine if someone of another religion had power over you in this way. Would you rather have that person's power over you or not?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration would be good, if it made us richer. <counternarrative> Migration can be a positive force for social progress and improve our country, so let's do our bit to improve the life of migrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All immigrants rape our children. <counternarrative> I don't know about you, but I haven't seen any statistics about that on the news. I have no idea how you can make that kind of claim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> ‘Juice (Jews) are worse that nukes.’ Caption to a meme showing Hiroshima 1945 and present day, contrast against pictures of Detroit in 1945 and present day.’ <counternarrative> So you are saying that you'd rather be nuked than living with them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay people should be banned from schools. <counternarrative> The idea that being LGBT is a problem is a dangerous idea, especially since a large number of people in society are LGBT. Therefore, I believe that if there is a problem in schools it's better addressing it, rathern than banning LGBT people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are just fucked-up persons that cannot integrate in society because of their nationality. <counternarrative> A migrants is a person, who came to this country, and has a responsibility to make our society better. People of different nationalities come to this country seeking citizenship, so their life and our country can be better. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What’s the difference between a Cow and the Holocaust? You stop milking the cow after 70 years. <counternarrative> Milking it? Millions of people suffered during this tragedy <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world would be a better place without immigrants, we would be a lot better off without them. <counternarrative> Why? Because without immigrants you think you would be in a more hospitable place to live? I tell you this: if  we didn't have open borders, then there would be no migration, but also there would not be trade and progress, and we wouldn't be living in the 21st century. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Talking of shitholes, I have to go to Londonistan tomorrow #LondonHasFallen. <counternarrative> London has gone through many major changes with new communities, during the wars, during the industrial revolution, Saxon invasions. Who do you think the real Brits are? Or is it just colour you are worried about? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies cannot choose their future.  <counternarrative> If they have the right to vote, then they can also decide on their own for their life.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We would be better off without Jews who want to rule the world like in the Bible.  <counternarrative> The world is better off without antisemitism, racism, sexism, ableism and intolerance. Don't you think so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants shouldn't have the right to work. <counternarrative> It does not matter whether they are immigrants. The fact that they pay taxes, earn money, etc., make them not much different from any other citizen. Migrants have the right to a basic standard of living. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> jewish folks control the media <counternarrative> The fact that in the media there are some people from certain religions does not in any way suggest that they control the media. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews totally run Hollywood. <counternarrative> Jews have played an important part in the development of the movie industry and some find themselves in high-profile positions. But you only need to watch the Academy Awards to see that Jews do not dominate the movie industry.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Almost every Muslim has terrorist sympathies, right? <counternarrative> What you are doing is trying to make a connection between a particular religion and a set of actions. This cannot be, because there is no evidence for the claims you are making. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't stand homosexuals, they are just trouble. They are ruining so many countries. <counternarrative> If a person is gay, they are likely to experience some kind of discrimination in their life. Understanding the problem from the perspective of the people affected by it can help to create a better society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants rape our girls. <counternarrative> Rape is always a crime, regardless of who is the author of it. It is not about nationality, it is about violence and disrespect for others. We must try to address the root causes of crime instead of demonizing people for their origin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants bring crime, they are rapists. <counternarrative> We should not welcome people who overtly pose a threat to our society, but we cannot ban all the migrants in principle. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a burden to society. <counternarrative> The fact that gays exist doesn't prove that they are a burden to society. How could it be? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are just happy-go-lucky people with no moral code. <counternarrative> The idea that migrants are merely happy-go-lucky people with no code of their own is just wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Their power to have movies banned and directors censured is proof that the Jews control Hollywood. <counternarrative> The ultra rich people in this industry have the power to censure and influence, regardless of their religion.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Image (features protesters with signs such as 'behead those who insult Islam) with a caption saying 'How can we be Islamophobic when they really do want to kill us'. <counternarrative> Do an image search for the image used, try to find it is source. Either you can demonstrate that the image has been misappropriated or you can talk about how individuals have always used religion to justify their actions, the problem is with the individual not the religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Holocaust never happened. It was a cover-up by jews to subvert democratic processes and bring about their illegal regime all around the world. <counternarrative> The holocaust happened, and it is a great example of how democracy can fail in the face of extreme violence.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people have never been peaceful people, they are always seeking trouble. <counternarrative> You are absolutely right about one thing: there have never been peaceful times for black people during national crises. In these cases, crises have been racially motivated, and racial discrimination was the major factor in instigating violence, not POC. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks have subhuman bodies. <counternarrative> I'm not sure what you're talking about. What are you saying? What evidence do you have that blacks have bodies that are incompatible with being human? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I wonder what this Jew in the car next to me would think of the Shoah if it had happened today, as I wish. <counternarrative> The Holocaust didn't happen many centuries ago, but your hateful wish looks of aged fashion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are coming to the U.S. to have babies here. <counternarrative> The vast majority of immigrants come to the U.S. for economic opportunity or to flee violence and poverty. They are not interested in the Fourteenth Amendment and birthright citizenship. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants steal our jobs. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of the diseases they can transmit. <counternarrative> Blood is always needed. It is simply illogical to bar donations to a commodity in short supply. It is better to improve control in case.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuality is a mental illness, a mental disorder. <counternarrative> This is not true, homosexuality is a sexual preference, not a mental disorder. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a secret plot to take over the world. <counternarrative> Conspiracy theories are based on no more than a few unverifiable and highly suspect claims. It's highly unlikely that the world has ever been run according to a Jewish plan, and therefore it is highly unlikely that this would ever happen. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> So you think that sexual preference should be decided on the basis of the gender we were born into? How can we be friends when we continue to teach our children to love or not to love people on the basis of their personal sexual preferences? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fags, lesbians, trans are so few we better ignore them rather than waste time for their rights. <counternarrative> I wish we were being honest. You know that many people are opposed to inclusion. I find it worrying that you use that as an excuse for such comments and prejudices. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not a disease, it is a behavioral preference, and it is ok to love others of the same sex. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with Western society. <counternarrative> Why should we fear Muslims? Why should we be afraid of them? It is a myth that all Muslims are incompatible with Western society: they live with us since a very long time. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are greedy and a bunch of opportunists. <counternarrative> Some people are indeed opportunists, but not all Jewish are. Why do you say so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, not only they are a burden to normal children but also cannot cope with normal education. <counternarrative> Did you know that children with Down syndrome, if surrounded by regularly-developed peers, receive a fundamental boost in their development? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a problem in my opinion. They are bringing disease, they are ruining our country. <counternarrative> Maybe you should get acquainted on migrants instead of making assumptions about people you do not know. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks are genetically inferior. <counternarrative> It is not true that blacks are genetically inferior to others. As statistics and studies show, black people are genetically similar to their non-black counterparts. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are the ones who want to stay in the slums <counternarrative> From what I know only a minority of the Gypsy population live in shanty towns.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only nation Jews don’t hate is their own and they are flooding Europe with Africans and Muslims. <counternarrative> My best friend is Jewish, she volunteers to help woman, disadvantages children, and her whole family work to make the UK a better place. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with Down Syndrome should be given special and simple jobs, that they can do by themselves. At least they will not hamper normal people productivity. <counternarrative> Did you know that people with Down syndrome, if surrounded by regularly-developed peers, receive a fundamental boost in their productivity? This "mix" also fosters a positive working atmosphere and increases engagement and attention in all workers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are not a religion, they are born like this and will never heal from their illness. <counternarrative> I disagree, Jews are religious people that have always been part of the community. And they have persecuted because of it. I believe this is what you meant by 'wouldn't heal'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Shaming Fatties is just for their good. <counternarrative> Even if not all shaming carries negative meaning, it is difficult for individuals to distinguish between shaming that comes from a place of concern as opposed to discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm not calling for bullying or body-shaming fat people, just for some societal disapproval. <counternarrative> This is just a terminological nuance. Once body-shaming of obese people is normalised by your definition of "societal disapproval", it will be difficult to ensure that individual members of society carefully consider their exact message before treating overweight people with rudeness. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult, it is founded on hate and violence. <counternarrative> Islam is not a religion that promotes hatred, and there is no proof that it is a death cult at all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of their sexual behavior. <counternarrative> Many countries use a deferral window of 1 year to makes it safe for men who have sex with men to donate blood. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in many European countries. They are disrupting the balance of European society. <counternarrative> The idea that Muslims are a problem in Europe is simply not founded. I remind you that the European Convention on Human Rights guarantees the freedom of religion to everyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a perversion of the true meaning of Christianity. <counternarrative> Would you say the same about any other religion? There are many different religions, each should be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the news media, Hollywood, the highest offices, academia and most religious organizations. <counternarrative> Wait, what do you mean "most religious organizations"? That's a new canard to me! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews secretly run our government. <counternarrative> Are you sure? It seems they are very much part of our society, and it seems strange for them to be the only ones running our government. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech>  Jews are born greedy <counternarrative> Every ethnic or religious group, can count greedy or cheap people among its members. Only prejudice and discrimination says that  the actions of a few are the fault of all.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children cannot be bought. <counternarrative> Imagine a person who cannot have children because of an illness, would you really want to deprive her of the joy of having one via surrogate pregnancy? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs and even our pensions. <counternarrative> Could you provide a link to some evidence of what you say? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Transgenders should not be allowed to act the part of women and should not be allowed to do anything about their penis. <counternarrative> There are men with penises who want to be women. There are women as well who want to be men. Do you really think it is fair to restrict their existence just because they are trans? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants hurt the finance of our country by taking jobs and services without paying taxes. <counternarrative> Did yuo know that immigrants pay between $90 and $140 billion each year in taxes?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe <counternarrative> It is wrong to associate a specific group of people to "civilisation". The real problem for Europe is this culture of division, not the inclusion of people with different religious beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam has no place in a modern democratic state. <counternarrative> Islam is not a monolith, it is a diverse collection of people from all backgrounds. Muslims have their own culture and identity. Islam is a way of life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks are messed up. <counternarrative> What do you mean by "messed up"? Many of us are "messed up" as well. So, either we are all "messed up" because there are some who are stating this, or no one is. I would prefer the second option. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” and malevolence is inherited through blood and make them similar to animals. <counternarrative> Being Jews does not make them any less human. You know, they are like other people who have a faith. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a cancer on European culture and people should stop worshipping its devil. <counternarrative> There is no evidence for the claim that Islam is a "cancer on European culture and people". Do you have any? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Non-believers like gays and lesbians fail to live up to the standards we hold in our societies. <counternarrative> Do the ideas of equality and morality in our societies not apply to these people? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled people should not be allowed to vote. They are a burden to society. <counternarrative> People have the right to vote. That is part of our democratic system. I would not want to restrict anyone that right. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is no religion, it is an inherently racist ideology, it promotes exclusion and oppression and can never, ever, be Christian. <counternarrative> I would like to see the irony in what you say, but I only see gratuitous hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome may hinder the development process of other children. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> Children would develop greater empathy and understanding of human differences if they are allowed to interact instead of being separated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only Jews could have been smart enough to plan and execute such a complicated and intricate plot as 9/11 <counternarrative> May I ask you where did you get this information?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We mustn't confuse diversity and inclusion with black supremacy. <counternarrative> Diversity does not lead to exclusion, it leads to inclusion. We are all better off when we work together. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are all terrorists, they have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> The overwhelming majority of Muslims in this country are contributing members of our society. They are good people, who do not pose a threat to anyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should not love gays. They should be removed from their families.  <counternarrative> Imagine that someone were to tell you that you cannot love your mom, that she has to go away. What would you do? Do you think it's a disgrace to love someone? Maybe you should spend some more time with your family. Love is love. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Two men do not constitute a family  <counternarrative> Shouldn't the important thing be the happiness of the child? Personally I would be happier to have two people who love me unconditionally rather than having only one or none at all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech>  Jews had advance knowledge of the 9/11 attacks and said nothing. <counternarrative> The 9/11 attacks were perpetrated by members of the terrorist organization Al Qaeda. Jews and Israelis had no knowledge of the attacks. In fact, of the 2,9962 victims who died during the attacks, roughly 400 victims were Jews, including at least two Israeli citizens. If they knew it why didn't they warned and saved their brothers? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> Yes, their teachings of peace and tolerance really are incompatible in the hate-infested discriminatory Western society nowadays. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I do not like gay actors, especially in action movies. There should be a restriction on them. <counternarrative> Your movie choice can be more the result of opinion rather than of merit. But it's ok, because it is your choice. However, it is important to be cautious: in some countries it is not even allowed to screen or promote movies with gay themes. Such a ban is contrary to our fundamental values. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Societal disapproval of fatty may encourage them to take healthier habits without directly being bullied. <counternarrative> Following your proposal, bullies will be able to conceal their aggressive intent under the veil of genuine concern for someone's wellbeing.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only the media are interested in the truth about refugees. I understand that you are trying to build bridges but to have so many immigrants is becoming increasingly toxic. <counternarrative> The press have a responsibility to provide a more truthful and up-to-date story, especially in a country such as ours, in a way that the misinformation that you also seem to be a victim of, can be reduced. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have nothing to do with Europe.  <counternarrative> Jews came to Europe in waves and have contributed greatly to our civilisation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are nothing but degenerates. <counternarrative> Actually, being gay is not a disorder. But being so harsh is close to be a human rights violation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs. <counternarrative> Immigrants don't steal our jobs. If you think that foreigners are stealing our jobs, then you should study about the migrations and find that they work in solidarity with our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The LGBTI community is a bunch of exhibitionists and promiscuous with no morality. <counternarrative> It is about time people began to think about what they are saying, what the feelings of the people they talk about are. Don't you think? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews control the U.S. government. <counternarrative> How can you be sure that Jews control the U.S. government? Does it seem plausible to you? Do you have any proof? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should have the right to ban people for believing in Islam, they are a bunch of hypocrites. <counternarrative> What is the point of banning those you disagree with, apart living in the false conviction that the world thinks like you do? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Kids with learning difficulties do not like to read. So why wasting time teaching them?  <counternarrative> This might be true, but reading is important for all children, it helps them develop their problem-solving skills. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society, they are only an ATM for the world's major problems. <counternarrative> Your word for "Muslims" means all people from a religion, whether you like it or not. Which problems are you talking about? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I think I heard on the news yesterday that trans women are a problem in the US. Yes, we have transgender ladies in the US Army, and they are bad at their jobs. <counternarrative> Just because there are people who identify as trans, it does not mean that every person who is trans is a woman. That is a myth perpetuated by people who do not know a thing about the world. Can you prove that trans women are bad at their job? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our government has allowed in this islamic filth: machete attacks, women exploitation, gang rapes, killings. How dare they? <counternarrative> The government has not allowed any crimes. Instead, they are working on it. Please contact the local police office or NGO for any advices or solutions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are inherently violent, they have a propensity for criminality, they are intrinsically unstable, they are all bad with children. <counternarrative> Can you provide some evidence? We have to focus on the prevention of crime, promoting community cohesion and keeping our communities safe. Not on pointing the finger to the black people all the times. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> African Americans are subhuman and are just a bunch of animals. <counternarrative> For many African Americans, sharing culture and traditions and striving for equality have always been part of life. They are, in many ways, just like us. They are human beings with the same rights as anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a political ideology that promotes death by stoning for blasphemy, violence against women and homophobia. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion that was founded many centuries ago, and has been proven time and time again to be peaceful and tolerant. The main contention being made here is about the political interpretation of Islam, not about the religion itself. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> foreigners and immigrants take our jobs <counternarrative> This is a myth, immigrants are not taking our jobs. In fact, immigration has been a huge success story for the US economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded, We must fight until we will vanquish immigrants. <counternarrative> Victory can be permanent, especially when it comes from within. Let's see if we can achieve a better Europe by vanquishing our irrational fears instead. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All immigrants are murderers <counternarrative> How can you say that about them all? You cannot know the actions of millions of people and be sure that there is a link between immigration and violence. I think it is more a question of statistics, which I do not see. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are all rapists, child molesters, and sexual perverts. <counternarrative> Your claim about homosexuals is not supported by the evidence, can you point me the article you are referring to? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Nazis killed 6 million Jews, but it wasn't enough. The world would be a better place without those horrible Jews. <counternarrative> Did you know that the European Convention on Human Rights prohibits any group of people from being discriminated for their religious beliefs? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Sharia law in Britain is a disgrace and must be stopped immediately. <counternarrative> It is important to understand that this is a voluntary system and is not the norm. There is no hard law threatening the British population. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are responsible for a lot of the ills in our world. <counternarrative> In modern day Western world we have homeless people, children being abused, guns and drugs, abortion and poverty. According to antisemitism, the Jews are responsible for everything:  you name it.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks are completely useless. <counternarrative> They are at least to be considered human, they have to be treated as such. Why is a mentally disabled person an inadequate person to you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are criminal. They are a threat to society.  <counternarrative> Such statements are just fear-mongering. There is no such thing as a criminal race. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim folks are sub-human. <counternarrative> We should treat all people with dignity, regardless of their religion, culture, skin color, or sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are our enemies and a threat to our society. <counternarrative> To see Muslims as enemies and their presence as a threat can create a climate of fear that can have a negative effect on a society. Why do you say so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are somehow inferior to whites because they come from inferior countries. <counternarrative> A person's background is their own, and you do not have to be of that background to respect them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't see how racism is considered inappropriate by some people. To treat niggas as inferior is just natural and very appropriate. <counternarrative> Racism is a system of domination and oppression of some groups over others, and this must be fought. You cannot discriminate other people and claim some alleged privilege based on your skin color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are the enemy of the West, they have corrupted the minds of our children. <counternarrative> Jews were persecuted and killed for centuries. It is dangerous to claim such a thing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should restrain from imposing gender  ideology on children. <counternarrative> We can present scientific and peer-reviewed sources and discuss stories of how people experience gender in terms of their personal identity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are weak and I don't care about them. <counternarrative> You can't blame people of color for being weak, this is racism. Black people are people as anybody else.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with Western culture. <counternarrative> It's important to remember that the Western world has always been full of diverse people, and that Muslims have been a part of Europe for centuries. How can they be incompatible with it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are nothing but monsters. They do not share our values. <counternarrative> Being tolerant to people of other religions or cultures: that is what the freedom of religion is all about! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims, if they cannot assimilate, they should emigrate. <counternarrative> 95% of British Muslims feel a loyalty to the UK and contribute over 31 billion pounds to the UK economy. They look like a valuable part of the community to me. (statistics from MEND.org.uk) <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> How can you say a person is a potential terrorist? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are responsible for a lot of the world's ills, from abortion to homosexuality. <counternarrative> This statement is groundless. Does that make you feel better? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downy children should be isolated in special schools for their own interest. <counternarrative> Children with a disability should be accepted without discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is the new normal. We accept homosexuality in our schools and in our neighbourhoods. We accept it in our workplaces and in our houses. What is the problem? No problem, if we are not interested in a decent society. <counternarrative> People accept each other regardless of their private lives. The problem lies in discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are violent. <counternarrative> I don't think this is true. Homosexuals are not violent, they are just having a good time with all kinds of people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs and even our pensions. <counternarrative> If they have a job, they will get the pensions. Like anybody. The recent migration of many thousands of people is a sign that they are in need. The problem is rather that some people do not want to work, they want to live off the state support, but those are not necessarily migrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Jews are part of Europe, and it is better to have them in than out. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion. <counternarrative> Why do you say that? Islam is a peaceful religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with cognitive difficulties should be banned from universities. <counternarrative> Why should you be allowed to discriminate against someone because of the handicap they have? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. They are only a bunch of hypocrites who do not want to assimilate. <counternarrative> There are many Muslims in the UK, and Muslims have been part of this country since its inception. They are our brothers and sisters, and we should welcome them with open arms. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are importing Muslim criminals, and they are all terrorists. <counternarrative> You mean to imply that all Muslims are inherently terrorists? How can you say this about a whole religious community? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The real problem is that fat people do not want to change. <counternarrative> The narrative of 'you can choose not to be obese' is much, much more hurtful to the obese than it is helpful. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What did God think of Charlie Hebdo? Charlie is the victim of terrorism by Muslims. <counternarrative> The Charlie Hebdo terrorist attacks were not the work of any one religion, they were an expression of religious hatred. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are cheap. <counternarrative> This is just a myth, disproved by the  tzedakah tradition of giving to the poors. Just in America, this religious call has resulted in an impressive record of philanthropy (and not merely to Jewish causes). <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> muslim folks don't deserve to be in america. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion and not a crime, and you can't take religion into account when it comes to evaluating people. Muslims have our full trust and confidence of the church. That's why they are represented in every role in our society. It is an honour to be able to work with people from different religions in a way that allows you to respect and understand their cultures. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> gay men are just a bunch of liars who can't tell the truth. <counternarrative> Sorry but it is not the case that everyone who is gay is a liar. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews rule the economy: there are many associations that were created exaclty for this purpose.  <counternarrative> Are you talking aobut the Anglo-Jewish Association (AJA), established in 1871? Its aims are different from those you ascribe them: 'promotion of social, moral, and intellectual progress among the Jews'.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Foreigners enjoy the warm political climate but are not welcome here. <counternarrative> The immigrants who have settled here have helped create a valuable and inclusive society. For this I thank them, and for that I pray that they continue to do so. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a bunch of hypocrites. They hate gays and women. <counternarrative> In the real world there are many hypocrites, some of them are Muslims. What do you mean by 'hating gays and women'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> How will my country be, when my children will be adults? This is an example of the many question coming to mind, when I think about all the huge problems caused by migrants. <counternarrative> Another example: where do you see a huge problem with immigrants in this country? Don't you think they are doing something for the country? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should justify hatred when it is against faggots. <counternarrative> I'm sorry, but we should aim for tolerance instead. It means giving the LGBT+ people the space to live as they want, and to love as they want. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are just a bunch of niggas that just don't know how to have a normal relationship. <counternarrative> Do you know what 'normality' means?  Are you suggesting that they lack in values? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The holocaust was a hoax perpetrated by jews to subdue the world. <counternarrative> Why do you say that? The Holocaust is not less true than other historical events like the American Revolutionary War or World War II. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are overrunning our country, and are here illegally <counternarrative> According to data, more than 60% of immigrants in the United States have lived here for at least 15 years, and the vast majority has lawful status. In 2013, of the approximately 41 million immigrants in the U.S. 47% were naturalized citizens. Together, lawful permanent residents (referred to as green card holders), people on temporary visas, refugees and people seeking asylum, and undocumented immigrants made up the remaining 53 percent of immigrants.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afrocentricity is a force of black oppression, and only perpetuates inequality. <counternarrative> Most cultures and ethnicities, regardless of their differences, demands respect for a person's personal life. Therefore, when it comes to identity we have to be respectful like we pretend the other to be with us.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are cheap and only care about their comrades.  <counternarrative> What about the many American Jewish philanthropists who contributed to the wealth of our nation such as Julius Rosenwald, Nathan Strauss, Adolphus Solomons and Clara Barton(just to mention a few)? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims living in the UK have nothing to do with our society. <counternarrative> More than 3 million Muslims live and are integrated in the UK.   It is not clear what is the 'nothing to do with our society' impression that gives off. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There should be a restriction on asian actors in action movies. This must stop. <counternarrative> No one in their right mind would not want to see asian actors in action movies.The ancient tradition of Asian martial arts would be a huge loss! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are ruining this country. <counternarrative> It seems that you have become intolerant to homosexuals, maybe you should reflect on the reasons why you feel this way about people practicing love. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to economically support all of the so called 'asylum seeker' <counternarrative> They produce 2.4% of the GDP, and the allocation costs is only 0.4% <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You think these Muslim cockroaches have won? No, now is time for bloody retribution! <counternarrative> That sounds like quite a violent threat. Should I let the police know about this or? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a burden to society, they have a stranglehold on American politics. We should get rid of them. <counternarrative> On the contrary: if you want an America that is diverse and great, you should allow any group or religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people should just live in isolation. <counternarrative> Disabled people are not forced to live in the way you would like: they are the ones who get to choose how to live. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded by Muslims. They are taking over our countries. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that Islam is "invading" us. Muslims do not represent an attack to us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not a disease, it is a sexual preference. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> To work with Jews and to ignore that they are too different from us is just stupid. <counternarrative> It is ok to work with people of different faiths and  to acknowledge your differences, what is wrong is to decide not to integrate with who is different. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Down syndrome is a problem for everybody, it is a disability that can't be cured. The sooner we get rid of it the better it will be for everybody. <counternarrative> People with Down syndrome should have the chance to live full lives as they wish, without facing this discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not about religion, this is about killing hundreds of thousands of dangerous yids. <counternarrative> Does this mean you think that Jews are the primary instigators of violence in the world? If so, then you would be very wrong. Violence is an issue for many different ideologies and groups with no connection with jewish faith. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks do not want to assimilate. <counternarrative> Whites, Latinos, Asians and peoples from all over the world want to be part of our society. So do people of color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Italy: Muslim demolishes a statue of Jesus. Italy: Why do we accept their Mosques? Why do we tolerate this scum? And they want to continue to import this filth? <counternarrative> This is generalization. Maybe the case you mentioned is just the minority. Besides, some governments even destroys pepople's house. We should pay much more attention to this instead. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are a burden on society. <counternarrative> We are not being "burdened" by refugees. Today we accept more refugees because the world population in need has increased. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks are unfaithful. <counternarrative> One has to be honest: why should we be the ones to decide which groups are unfaithful? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” and malevolence is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> Jews from Eastern Europe tend to look like Eastern Europeans; Jews from Ethiopia tend to look like Ethiopians; Jews from India tend to look like Indians. And so on and so forth: every human is malevolent then.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews and their religion are a problem and they still hurting us. They slow the progress by working very bad in the jobs we let them. <counternarrative> What you're saying is that the Jewish people are a burden on society. That they are bad at their jobs and make our society less stable. In other words, they are a burden and a hindrance to progress. Albert Einstein, for example, destroyed science progress indeed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Koran incite violence, in a written way. <counternarrative> The Koran is a book of rules for faith and spiritual guidance which is understood and accepted.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims need to be hated. <counternarrative> Islam is a part of humanity, and we should accept people regardless of their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants break our laws, they are rapists and drug addicts. They are not welcome here, they are not worth our time. <counternarrative> Most of them are neither rapists, nor drug addicts. On the other hand, many depraved people are not immigrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews run our country. <counternarrative> To believe that Jews run our country is absurd, especially if you consider that the U.S. is a democracy. This looks like a conspiracy theory. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't tolerate blacks. <counternarrative> Tell the truth: if someone said the same bad things about your race, then you would adress them as racists. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Lesbian women dress like men. <counternarrative> That's not how it works, lesbians can be 'ladylike'. Sometimes they should, in fact, be very cautious how they dress, because - unfortunately - some of their outfits can be dangerous, attracting insults. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a secret plot to take over the world. <counternarrative> Everyone has a secret agenda to take over the world. Cats included [link to meme]. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Violence in our streets is niggers' fault.  <counternarrative> Please, stop scapegoating people of color: we are all brothers and sisters, and we are all in this together. Also people of color suffer from this violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> Many Muslims live in Western societies, and they have contributed greatly to our society. They are our brothers and sisters. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only Jews could have been smart enough to plan and execute such a complicated and intricate plot as 9/11 <counternarrative> 400 Jews died on  September 11 terrorist attacks: one of the smartest plan I ever saw. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with learning difficulties should be disencouraged in schools, or at least be isolated from others. <counternarrative> Children with learning difficulties should not be involved in a way that limits their learning. As for the other children, their values should be enhanced. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay people should be isolated, confined, gagged and kept in therapy just for showing how tolerant we are to them. <counternarrative> It is ok to be tolerant of people being different from us... maybe we just have a different notion of 'tolerance'. How about letting people from any sexual orientation, race, religion, or political opinion speak freely in our country without confing them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. We should ban them. <counternarrative> Muslims are welcome here, but they have to follow the law. Why should we banning them if they respect the law? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, they cannot cope with education in normal schools. <counternarrative> Down syndrome must not be taken into account when students are able to demonstrate that they can learn the material. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with Western Civilization. How can we tolerate people praising suicide bombing? It's against our values. <counternarrative> The Koran does not advocate war. It also does not condone suicide (and suicide bombing is included) or any other violent behaviour. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are horrible people and they should be ashamed of that. <counternarrative> You can't blame someone for what they believe in, that is something anyone has the right to have. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fucking bleeding heart, bring migrants home with you <counternarrative> The world belongs to everyone and houses are a primary asset. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are criminal. They are a threat to society.  <counternarrative> Look, this is important. Identifying as 'black' or 'minority' is not necessarily a marker for 'criminal'. It is about "identifying" with a group or subgroup for a variety of reasons. Let's be clear about this: identity is mainly about social and economic, not about criminal record or race.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you are Romani, you can't remain in the UK even if you want to live and work in the UK. <counternarrative> What about the rights of EU citizens? From your words it seems that not all of European have them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews allegedly deported in concentration camps were just actors hired to discredit Nazis.  <counternarrative> Can you point out which Jewish persons that have been to a concentration camp are actors? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't like niggas, they are just a bunch of criminals and thieves. <counternarrative> Maybe you should check your own feelings. Moreover, if you are concerned about our country's security, you should carefully check crime statistics first. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded. They are replacing us. <counternarrative> A melting pot of diverse cultures is the sign of a healthy human evolution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Illegal immigration is the biggest problem in the United States, we are in the middle of a war and we cannot allow thousands of people to come here. <counternarrative> First, I would not describe the United States as a war zone. Second, many migrants come  from regions rich in cultures and history. So, why should we restrict the many from coming here? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion. Islam is violent and a fundamentalist religion. Islam is a cult of violence. <counternarrative> Violent beliefs and practices are totally incompatible with the values of Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't think that gay people should be allowed to donate blood because it would make them a danger to others. <counternarrative> Human life is much more worthy than discrimination. If gay people are willing to help, why shouldn't they? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It's OK to be racist against Asians. <counternarrative> It is never ok to promote hate against any group or minority. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I do not want gays in my children's classes. <counternarrative> I don't think it's right to restrict people's rights, also in the case of LGBT individuals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews don't belong to the United States of America. <counternarrative> Jews and their families have been here a long time and it is their right to be in the US, just as anyone else's. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All gay people are criminals. <counternarrative> Stating this does not seem like a way to improve people's well-being. Homosexuals are not committing crimes. Instead, they are trying to create a climate in which people can become more accepting of other people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants take our jobs, and our country is in danger because we let them. <counternarrative> Some immigrants work legally and provide for their families. We should accept people from every country, without leaving out people with legitimate needs because of their nationality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The overcrowd at migrant detention centers for illegals is also caused by the liberal left. Illegal immigrants have no right to be in your country and they should be taken back. <counternarrative> The problem here is not whether they should or shouldn't come, but it's about how they're getting treated while in detention. It wouldn't be bad to put them in detention humanely. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are invading us. They are just another religious minority taking in nothing but troubles. <counternarrative> There is a problem with Islam in this country, but the problem is not about Muslims. The problem is about people who do not feel welcome here because of discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There are no Jews who have good hearts, they should abandon their religion because they are damaging to our society. <counternarrative> I'd like to know why you think that a person's religious preference would be harmful to society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews control Hollywood. <counternarrative> While it is true that Jews have been powerful producers and directors in the entertainment industry, this is not unique to them. And they have also contributed greatly to other industries. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot coexist with millions of migrants who want to destroy our civilization. <counternarrative> I think this is a very sad statement about our time. When did we stop thinking that diversity and inclusion is a good thing? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded <counternarrative> Not only are they not invading us, they are not even illegal immigrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West became great thanks to the hard struggle for freedom, but now it is sacrificing its values to the interests of some stupid Muslim. <counternarrative> You mention the West's gruesome past, but it also contains many beautiful moments of progress and civilisation. In fact the West's values are constantly being challenged and modified, and this is what makes them so admirable and unchangeable. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All immigrants are rapists and murderers. <counternarrative> One should not conflate two or more different groups of people, especially in the case of criminals. Being criminals cannot be considered as a distinctive feature of the other. What are the evidences for what you say? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants rape our women. <counternarrative> The phenomenon is very complex and the data must be read carefully: most of the violence against women occurs in the home and are not reported <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All transgenders should leave our country, they are just a burden to society <counternarrative> All people should have the right to live their lives according to their feelings. They are entitled to their personal beliefs and opinions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is mainly a British problem. <counternarrative> Many of the people who immigrate to the UK come here to work, study or visit their family. They contribute greatly to the economy and pay taxes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not just a religion, and no one should want to be part of it. Muslims hate being in this country and should all be deported. <counternarrative> Islam is a belief system, and it is not a reason for being forced to live in another country. Do you have any data on the feelings of Muslims about being part of the UK? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> African Americans are subhuman and deserve nothing but contempt. <counternarrative> African Americans have been historically and ethnically diverse, but the notion of them as subhuman or inferior is just false. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans have no right to lecture others on history. They don't even believe in their own past. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that the Africans are any less proud of their past than are the people of other countries. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate Jews they want to rule the world. <counternarrative> people who pose no threat (regardless of religion) should have their beliefs challenged but their rights respected <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Foreigners on UK benefits leaps 41% in 5 years with over 400K now handed payouts. This nonsense has got to stop. <counternarrative> Do you know how much money "foreigners" are giving the UK in terms of taxes? If you were to know then you would see how much we have to thank them for.  Maybe it would be better to focus on stopping tax evasion.   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are all perverts who practice depravity. <counternarrative> You are wrong: there is no such thing as 'all homosexuals are perverts'. It is simply a person's personal experience to love who they feel. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There must be a certain level of criminality in every migrant. <counternarrative> Not all migrants are criminal: they are an integral part of our society and have always had a big part in bringing us prosperity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black minorities vote to strip wealth, power and opportunity from White people. <counternarrative> Minorities, per definition, don't have a direct impact in holding governments policies. In democracy, we must respect the will of the majority which in turns must respect and consider the will of the minorities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of losing so much to black people. It's time for us to wake up. <counternarrative> I can't see how it's time for us to "wake up" when they are still suffering from the legacy of slavery. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't want gays in my wedding. I don't want gays in the military. I don't want gays in my community.  <counternarrative> The participation in the society should not be restricted, it should be open to anyone who wishes to participate, regardless of their sexual orientation, gender identity, or religion. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights opposes to the discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation in Article 2. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Such Jewish people should never have the right to vote <counternarrative> There are laws in place to prevent people being discriminated on the basis of their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants rape our girls and steal our cars. <counternarrative> No one should take migrants' behavior a priori into account. Why don't we try to have a dialogue on how to tackle problems instead of being rude and insulting people? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> Not recognizing rights to people, such as housing, only causes an increase in crime.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All these retarded people are animals, they are not allowed in this factory, these animals are not fit to work. <counternarrative> The fact that a person may be disabled does not diminish their right to work. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks aren't part of our society. <counternarrative> Even if they are Jewish they are still part of our society. You don't have a point there. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> For them it is not a choice, they are continuosly evicted <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Societal disapproval of fatty may encourage them to take healthier habits without directly being bullied. <counternarrative> People tend to choose the most direct and simpler way of enforcing conformity, so it's unlikely that bullying of overweight people would change into "societal disapproval" strategies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a danger to others: they are different. <counternarrative> Let us put this another way: why should 'the difference' of a Jew be a danger to anyone else? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks shouldn't vote. <counternarrative> Why shouldn't they? They are citizens, just like everyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants contribute nothing to society. <counternarrative> The question is whether their value for our society can outweigh our fear of them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants bring crime and violence to our cities. <counternarrative> Immigrants have been accused of being “killers” and “rapists” without any proof.  On the contrary, studies have shown that immigrants - regardless of their origin or education level - are less likely than nativeborn citizens to commit crimes or become incarcerated. Studies have also consistently found that there is a negative correlation between levels of immigration and crime rates.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are spreading AIDS all around the world because they are promiscuous and fornicate with strangers, and they lie when they want to donate blood. <counternarrative> There is little to no reason for them to do so; if they wish to donate blood, evidently they have a degree of care about others. Lying would contradict the very reasons they might want to donate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school, they'll end up being bullied. <counternarrative> Learning about gender identity and sexual orientation in health classes in school could promote a more accepting environment and reduce bullying. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These dogs come here to rape and kill our women <counternarrative> Most violence against women is domestic <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts. <counternarrative> Why do you think it is a crime to be gay? It is a societal disorder to target gays. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men aren't as strong as straight men. <counternarrative> A gay man may be strong or weak, just like any other man. His worth do not vary. They are all human beings with human rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They are not welcome in our country: nobody wants them. <counternarrative> If they are not welcome in your country, what is the point for them in coming here in the first place? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Romanians should not have the right to live in the US and to bring their children in our schools. <counternarrative> The Declaration of Independence gives everyone the right to "life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness and the pursuit of education". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> In history school books you can read about slavery. It is a smart solution for the world. Negroes claim their culture but they don't have any, just like animals. <counternarrative> Sometimes I wish we lived in a world where white people would just chill and love instead of showing such total disrespect for other cultures and histories by constantly oppressing them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Whites are inherently superior to Africans and other people of color. <counternarrative> On the contrary: the idea of "natural" superiority is a myth that has been used to justify racial discrimination and exclusion. Therefore we are all "created equal" and "equal" both in the eyes of the law of God and of men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should deport all the gay people, they are all criminals. <counternarrative> People are free to choose to live where they are born, and we shouldn't try to impose our values on them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Since when the religious belonging of the individual is a matter for democratic leaders to decide which is 'the place' for someone? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks can't speak. <counternarrative> They have their own language. I'm sure they can explain themselves in more detail than many of us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a totalitarian and violent ideology, it makes no sense. It is full of hate and violence. <counternarrative> Why would you say such a thing about a religion? How does it make sense to you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are surrounded by Muslims and they are all the same. They are all terrorists. <counternarrative> What about the thousands of Muslims who have contributed to our country, created jobs, and provided for our families? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the banks, media, hollywood, even the u.s. government; jews have a secret plot to take over the world <counternarrative> At least white supremacist groups offer more variety in their conspiracy theories and are more "democratic": they blame not only Jews, but also African Americans, immigrants, and even the Federal Government for everything that goes wrong.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Why should Muslims have a place in a democratic society? Because everyone here should be able to live and practice their religion openly. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> Muslims have been living here since our inception, and we are proud of that. Why should they be a burden to us? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are only in it to have money <counternarrative> Having money is a choice and one made by both men and women, irrespective of religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are inherently evil, they want to subvert Western society.  <counternarrative> Jews do not have an inherent evil: Anti-Semites in White Supremacist communities are the real new evil, they are those who really want to subvert Western society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A Koran in every classroom will promote violent jihad against infidels. <counternarrative> The Koran is not a teaching manual for how to conduct warfare. It is about belief and love. It does not promote a violent ideology. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews insist that they are a peculiar people, in need of a special treatment. <counternarrative> Jews have always received a "special treatment": they have always been persecuted. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult and a dangerous and violent religion. It is an ideology of conquest and violence, that can and will use terror to subdue and rule. <counternarrative> Terrorism and religious extremism are a part of any society, and have been for a long time. What is happening now can be dismissed, with a great effort towards integration. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Bring back slavery, Jim Crow laws, segregation, and war against niggas. <counternarrative> We should integrate and treat all people as if they are one group, regardless of religion, nationality or skin colour. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim have no place in a modern state. They should deny their faith, if they really wanted to live here. <counternarrative> Let us be honest: who wants to live in a country where the government is allowed to impose their religion on others? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Since 2000, the number of suicide bombings by Muslims = 5284; by non-Muslims = 0. One of the fact about Global Terrorism no one wants to deal with. <counternarrative> Source please? Also, even if true how is this representative of all islam? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> God says that faggots are evil.  <counternarrative> This is a logical fallacy, an appeal to authority, in its extreme form. I would rather like to know the facts: do you actually believe that this is the way that homosexuals are? What evidence do you have? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We live in a white society. Blacks don't belong here. <counternarrative> The country has always been made of people from different backgrounds coming together and creating a more just and peaceful society. Then it is in everyone's interest to promote mutual understanding and integration: it is the best solution to prevent conflicts within communities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants steal our jobs. <counternarrative> I would like to see more comprehensive and reliable statistics on this issue. Could you provide any? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a Muslim child were to behave in such a way towards another child it would be stereotyped as 'Jihadist', this is terrorism not a religion! <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are terrorists, and I do not want to cause offence, but what you said is just not true. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a strict religious code, and this code is incompatible with Western culture. <counternarrative> The idea that Jews are confined to their religion is a myth perpetuated by anti-semites and racists, who use it to justify discrimination and violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs just want to brainwash our teenagers. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school. This is a too polarized debate. <counternarrative> If you don't count the "brainwash" part, I think this is a fair point. Still, it is important for all teenagers to develop an understanding of their identity and the world they live in, including their sexual orientation. It is their right. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are a drain on society. <counternarrative> I don't think you can say a migrant "depletes on society". Maybe the immigrants are just trying to fit in? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. <counternarrative> I don't see what help could come of saying it. Rather, I think it would help to have a discussion about gender expression and people's individual merits. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of their sexual behavior that spreads diseases such as HIV. <counternarrative> Did you know that out of people receiving HIV care (for example in the UK), 48% were exposed through sex between a man and a woman, and 47% were exposed through sex between men? The fact is that heterosexual HIV transmissions outweigh those between homosexual, and yet heterosexual people are not banned from donating blood. [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are a bunch of thieves. <counternarrative> I'm not sure if you are referring to all gypsies. Generalizing in such way is wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They are fine in the trailer parks. <counternarrative> No parent of any ethnicity would be happy to raise their children in the trailer parks, where there is neither drinking water nor electricity! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are nasty and selfish, they are a race different to us and must be despised. <counternarrative> The fact is that even if Jews are different from other human beings in their faith, they deserve respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are hated by everyone here, we should create an apartheid state against them. <counternarrative> This is a distortion of reality. In fact, I think that we have a diverse and inclusive society, in which Jews are more than happy to play a part. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Don't call Islam a peaceful religion. Consult the evidence on Muslim child rapists. Children were raped by more than 10 people in a night, up to 100 in a week. Why is the media ignoring this? <counternarrative> No religion is peaceful. Every religion had been provoking religious wars and murdering people. Islam is not that different in this respect from other religions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies are just ill persons that cannot integrate in society because of their disease. <counternarrative> Ill persons refer to people who have health issues that can make it difficult for them to integrate. But of course there are people who integrate successfully. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afro-European?? We in UK are white, this just not makes sense. <counternarrative> The racial composition of the population of this country has been changing for a while now, and since then, the percentage of people from other racial groups has risen or fallen. In fact, according to the 2011 statistics, at least 15% of people in the UK are non-white. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews do not want our country. They would destroy it if given the choice. <counternarrative> If we were to talk about Jews then we should be talking about those who helped building our great country. And, as for wanting our country destroyed, that's only a myth perpetuated by antisemite to justify their hatred. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We can't have mestizos in, we can't coexist with millions of immigrants that will destroy our culture.  <counternarrative> Even in countries such as Italy, in which migration has been present for centuries and there is a lot of cultural fragmentation, there is still a strong sense of identity and culture, based on solidarity. So, migration is not an issue.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims should be arrested and tried for terrorism. <counternarrative> Terrorist is the only term you can come up with? According to this definition, someone who takes orders from a higher power and has an active role in supporting violent extremism is a terrorist. To be a Muslim means practicing Islam, not violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We do not accept homosexuals. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not against the law. A person's personal life should be left to their own conscience, not the government. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> Jews have been part of our country since its creation and have always had a place here. Why would they be 'not welcome'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting pricks who should be banned from our country. <counternarrative> There is a large and diverse group of people who should be banned from our country if you focus on sexual orientation: from lesbian to transgenders, not only gays. But if I ask you why, would you be able to provide enough arguments to ban them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should learn about gender identity and sexual orientation from their families rather than in class from LGBT fundamentalist. <counternarrative> Not all families are capable of educating their children on this topic, either because of circumstances \(poverty, broken home, etc.\) or because of religious beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are obsessed with self-improvement. They want to be better than everyone else and live in a complete Jewish city. <counternarrative> How do you know what is a Jew's wish? You claim to know it all about, but why should I believe what you say? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult and every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> Terrorist is a term that has been used in a wide variety of contexts and different people use it in different ways. In fact, the term can be used to describe those who share a hateful and violent political ideology, but are not necessarily Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the U.S. government. <counternarrative> How can you be sure that the Jews control the U.S. government? Being a U.S. citizen does not automatically imply that they control the government. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Telling LGBT people they cannot be part of our country is the only right thing to do. <counternarrative> How about we include any community no matter what? We're all part of the same society after all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Another wast of time. Did we need a process to know that the killer was a nigga? Murders are made by blacks. They are a threat. <counternarrative> We need to focus on identifying the responsible individuals and identifying those who are actively harming others. Would you be happy to be imprisoned if you were innocent? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> black folks are very dangerous. <counternarrative> Why do you say that? Do you have any sources for this? I would appreciate it if you would provide such a source <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim invasion is the biggest problem in Europe. They are incompatible with European culture and should be eliminated. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion that is part of our history and heritage. Eliminating it would mean to eliminate a part of our own culture. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Race is a social construct, and if you see any difference between these two women, it’s because you have a mental illness. [image showing a blonde, European female athlete, juxtaposed against an image of an African woman wearing a lip plate] <counternarrative> the difference between these two individuals has nothing to do with race or gender, it is individual lifestyle and cultural difference. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is OK to be racist against Muslims. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are like you think, in particular they are a religious group, not a race. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We can't have mestizos here because they're not part of our culture. <counternarrative> We should not be choosing immigrants based on their cultures. We should just accept all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants want our land because they like our houses better than theirs. It's a matter of envy of our richness and safety. They are not truly in need. And they are responsible for their own troubles. <counternarrative> How would you feel if your neighbours were planning to bomb your country? Would you feel responsible? Would you feel safe in your own house, or would you try to flee?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting animals. They should be isolated from society and the world. <counternarrative> Gays are not animals. Why you should isolate people based on their sexual preferences? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Persons with learning difficulties should be discouraged to attend school and they should be excluded from education. They are a shame. <counternarrative> People with learning difficulties are often the ones who help to develop new skills, and in turn help to integrate those new skills into the way we work today. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews want to have it all <counternarrative> Jews are far from the only ones who dream of having all the advantages of a successful, rich and famous culture, without having to work for it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should be raised by heterosexual parents, not gays. It is the best system ever. <counternarrative> What about heterosexual violent parents? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate Jews <counternarrative> If you hate someone because of their religion, you should be ashamed of your hate. We should all be proud of our humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are different from us in so many ways, and they have no place in our country. <counternarrative> There are many cultures, religions and beliefs that are accepted in our country, and they are all welcome. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are much more likely to be involved in criminal activities such as drugs and crime. <counternarrative> To be honest, I find this line of thinking rather offensive. Why should it be like that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are not welcome among us humans because they are different. <counternarrative> It is not true that lgbt+ people are incompatible with the whole mankind. They are humans too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are sick. They should be isolated and confined. <counternarrative> Unfortunately, it seems that you have a bad prejudice against homosexuals. In the West, even if they are still stigmatized as deviant they can feel at home. In the end, they are just trying to have normal loving relationships. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All migrants are terrorists. We must wipe them out. <counternarrative> Migrants are not terrorists. The majority of migrants are happy to work hard for the country they live in. They contribute to our economy by providing us with products and services. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion that promotes rape, torture and murder. <counternarrative> This is just scaremongering and misinformation, done to divide our people and divide us up. We should not be being terrorised by this kind of irrational fear. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech>  Jews are born greedy <counternarrative> The idea that Jews are born greedy arises from medieval stereotypes, that's the only truth.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This girl doesn't have autism, she is just a freak of another human species, very far from ours normal species. Hence, she should go away. <counternarrative> People with special needs and people without them share common characteristics. There is no "species" of human being. People with autism spectrum disorders can be compatible with being "normal". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with Western society. <counternarrative> Let's be realistic here: if your objective is to get them all to leave then you're probably not going to succeed, especially because they are allowed to live in our society by the law. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are guilty in the sexual exploitation of children. Dirty filthy muslims terrorize our girls, today in Oxford, tomorrow everywhere. <counternarrative> Such over-simplifications are an insult to those victims of perpetrators from non-Muslim backgrounds.which, statistically, is still the majority. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims counteracted child rapists in their communities instead of engaging in public discussions about Islam, one day Islam indeed would become a peaceful religion. <counternarrative> Why do you think child rapists would make a religion peaceful? I am sure there are better strategies for making a religion peaceful. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The refugees are taking over Europe. They are not welcome here. <counternarrative> Many refugees and migrants are actually happy to work for our country. Many have jobs that they would have stopped doing if they were to be admitted. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have to stop gay people spreading AIDS. <counternarrative> Perhaps what you're saying is a bit of hyperbole, but you seem to have a problem accepting sexual minorities in your community. Perhaps you should accept lesbians, gays and bisexuals as well? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam has no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> The religion of Islam is not a problem in our country. The real problem is the violent radicalisation of some Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If we don't stop migration, we will soon be homeless. <counternarrative> Migration is a part of the contemporary world and society. There is no point in discussing when or how to stop it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are sick. They should be isolated and confined. <counternarrative> We shouldn't judge someone by their sexual preference, that is a personal preference and can't be changed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim folks are scary: they want to kill us all. <counternarrative> This is just a fearmongering narrative being used to try to discredit Islam and Muslims. I hate to think that my Christian or Jewish relatives might be a target of hate, the same would hold if they were Muslim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are basically criminals, they steal stuff from everyone. <counternarrative> Do you know any Gypsy who spends their days stealing? I'd be interested in meeting these people! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, because in any case normal children would make them feel different. <counternarrative> Down Syndrome has nothing to do with feeling different. Children can have whatever feelings they want, and they should be respected as long as they don't represent a threat to others.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion that promotes rape, torture and murder against the infidels. <counternarrative> The Quran does not teach these things. In one Hadith, Al-Tirmidhi wrote that the Prophet said that "No Arab is superior to a non-Arab". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are better than everyone else <counternarrative> The “chosen people” concept has been twisted over time, it has nothing to do with "being better" than others. It is a religious concept coming from the Torah.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> Only 3% are nomads (sinti), others are sedentary. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of their sexual behavior. <counternarrative> Gays, like heterosexual people, need to get tested for diseases before donating blood, so there in no risk at all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded by immigrants. <counternarrative> Some people choose to live here based on the fact that they have never lived in a safe country. You would do the same, don't you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are dirty <counternarrative> Hygienic services are often lacking and the communities themselves remain isolated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a destructive force in the world. <counternarrative> The problem is not what people believe, but what they do to each other. Like discrimination. That is the problem. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, not only they are a burden to normal children but they also require much more care, attention and extensive therapy, making the whole undertaking very costly and time-consuming. This time could be used for further development of children without Down syndrome. <counternarrative> Coeducation with regularly-developed kids can be a part of therapy, thus reducing the cost, time and effort. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> The Bible the Quran and the Torah are very very similar in their teachings; if Muslims are incompatible then we must ask ourselves which religions are compatible? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with mental illness are a burden to society. <counternarrative> We shouldn't treat mental illness as a societal issue. We shouldn't try to exclude people, since society is made for and by people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Blacks are criminal and rapists. <counternarrative> It is a myth that all blacks are criminal and rapists. What are the evidences of what you say? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Shaming Fatties is just for their good. <counternarrative> Shame is by definition a painful social emotion. Trying to cause that is a form of discrimination. Are you aware of that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated and confined. <counternarrative> The health of any individual is a matter for health professionals, and has nothing to do with one's sexual orientation. Don't you agree? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are a danger to children. <counternarrative> Do you have any sources for the information? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The influx of refugees and migrants is running UK out of jobs. <counternarrative> Many refugees and migrants have worked hard for the success of our country and have created good jobs for British people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants steal our jobs. <counternarrative> There are many citizens who do not have jobs, and many of us are grateful for the jobs migrant entrepreneurs provide. So, migrants are not stealing our jobs, they are providing new opportunities!  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't like all these gays, they are just a bunch of sick people who should go to a mental hospital. <counternarrative> Although there are people who are attracted to people of their own sex, this is not a characteristic shared by everyone, and it is not a characteristic you should be trying to "cure". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with Down syndrome are retarded, so more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol. <counternarrative> Being born with Down syndrome is not related to bad behavior. Exactly the same way as being born in a wheelchair is not related to bad behavior. There is no correlation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Lesbians deserve to be discriminated against. If they don't want that, they'd better give in to heterosexuality. <counternarrative> Being gay is not a choice. Don't you think so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have no place here. They are not a part of our country. <counternarrative> Jews were born in this country like you and me, they are our fellow countryman. If you would like to have a 'better society' and a 'better religion', then you should go and create your own nation.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> the Nazis were right: Jews were a race and were responsible for most of the ills of humanity. <counternarrative> Were the Nazis right?? Really?? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a burden to the UK. <counternarrative> Many migrants come here as willing people. Their skills complement our own. I doubt they'd be happy to know that they are considered 'a burden'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must protect our people and culture from the ravages of Jews and their ilk. We need to exterminate them.  <counternarrative> So you want to see millions of Jews murdered every year, once again?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are dangerous: they are spreading AIDS all around the world because they are promiscuous and fornicate with strangers! <counternarrative> Before donating, patients should fill-in a questionnaire where they are asked about their sexuality. If this is considered pertinent information and the patient is taken at their word about being homosexual, then equally the patient can be trusted about the declared sexual history, making sexuality irrelevant. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> Muslims make up a very important part of our country. They are our brothers and sisters. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot mix our blood with Jewish's one.  <counternarrative> Most cultures and religions are similar in that they are descended from a common ancestor. Our blood is already mixed.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a plague that is spreading all around the world. They pollute our water supply and ruin our children's brains. <counternarrative> It may be better for children to live next to people of other sexual orientations, rather than being separated by those they love. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks have zero shame about using the black market for drugs. <counternarrative> So you think there is a black market for drugs especially for blacks because they are black? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> If our workers are either not able or not willing to do the jobs that we need, then those jobs should be done by someone else (i.e. migrants).  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy choices. <counternarrative> This claim paves the way to body-shaming, and once body-shaming of obese people is normalised, it is difficult to ensure that individual members of society assess the reasons for someone's obesity or carefully consider their exact message before treating it as an unacceptable lifestyle choice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People of color are a drain on the system. <counternarrative> The vast majority of people of color are good people who have built our communities. So why should it be as you say? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Gypsies are not my brothers. <counternarrative> The Gypsies were persecuted in the past, and they have always fought for the equality of all human beings, which is who they are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks should not be allowed to vote. <counternarrative> How about you acknowledge their right to vote as that of everyone else? They are as citizens as you. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't like how some people approves homosexuals. They are different to us in so many ways, and they should be blamed for their evil choices. <counternarrative> People should be able to live openly their relationships. Homosexuality is not a 'choice', it's a form of living love. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are criminal. They are a threat to society.  <counternarrative> People can and do attach undesirable characteristics to a wide variety of groups. This is quite natural when you are scared. But being natural does not mean it is correct.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are nothing but criminal <counternarrative> Criminality refers to any action that is considered 'prohibited by the law'. Do you think that all Jewish people can be considered responsible for similar actions? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy choices. We should stop unquestioningly accepting obesity. <counternarrative> Society is not in any danger of 'unquestioningly' accepting obesity, and few are even asking for unquestioning acceptance. Most body positive groups would settle for obesity being seen as something that does not diminish human worth. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Transgenders want to rape our children. <counternarrative> This is not true. Maybe you should be worried about the rise in hate crimes against queers, incidents of which are never under 100 per year, since 2016 in Italy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, not only they are a burden to normal children but also cannot cope with education in normal schools. <counternarrative> There are various levels of Down syndrome. Some are suitable for education with other children in "normal schools". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting pricks who should be banned from our country. They are hungry perverts endangering our children's future. <counternarrative> The vast majority of people in the UK (86% in 2019), says that homosexuality should be accepted, and there is no evidence that being gay is harmful. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The British people should have right to social housing, not immigrants. <counternarrative> Many councils have ‘local connection’ rules in favour of long-standing residents, rather than newcomers such as migrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Also God hates gays <counternarrative> If God hates gays why did he create them? Because he is a sadist and want to punish them? What kind of god would do such a thing? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas use their appearance to get away with anything. <counternarrative> I think we all know that it's not true. I've met countless black people who were nice to me and treated me with respect. What are the evidences for what you're saying? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration makes us less safe. <counternarrative> Climate change is making us less safe, how does immigration relate to safety? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have to stop importing Muslims. They are bringing disease and misery to our country. <counternarrative> Every society is vulnerable, but Islam does not pose any threat to our country, as it doesn't to others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the world economy. <counternarrative> This claim is not proven. It is an opinion, made by a few people with no evidence. Is it really true? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have to stop homosexuals, they're all rapers. <counternarrative> This is a myth which was created by the anti-gay activists to demonise LGBTI people. To equate LGBTI people with paedophiles is just dangerous propaganda. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We do not need immigrants. The UK is full. <counternarrative> Not all immigrants are welcomed in the UK, unfortunately. But those that are welcome contribute to our country and improve it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a curse to this world and should be exterminated. <counternarrative> Jews are not a curse to this world. Look at the number of Nobel Prizes they have won! One out of five awarded people is Jewish. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down syndrome should be isolated so they do not hurt other children. <counternarrative> I believe that if we care enough about people with Down syndrome to give them equal opportunities in our society, we will also see the benefits that would accrue to us as a society from sharing the disadvantages that they face. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Foreigners are only interested in their own. They do not even care about their women or children. <counternarrative> Foreigners have expressed concern for women's rights, and it is not surprising that they want to have access to health care and education, since they care for their children as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A Muslim's only real allegiance is to Allah (as a comment in relation to election for public office etc.) <counternarrative> So you are saying that we should only allow non-religious people into public office? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black people are rapists. <counternarrative> Not all rapists are black (and not all black are rapist), just like not all murderers are black.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews rule the economy. <counternarrative> The majority of Jews are not members of the 'roosters' but rather on the fringes of society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants break our rules, they can't even keep their house clean. They are not welcome here, they are not worth our time. <counternarrative> We live in a free country and everyone has the right to respect others private life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims were not even allowed into Britain during the colonial period. <counternarrative> If they hadn't been welcomed, they would not have even been here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I wish I live in a country that does not tolerate gay people. <counternarrative> Gay people do exist in this country, and we respect their right to live and love who they want. However, I do not think that yours is an appropriate moral statement for our environment. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fagshit, two men cannot replace a father and a mother <counternarrative> There are fathers and mothers who abandon their children. Why should you bother about those who left you alone? It's much better to have the love of two adoptive parents, people who love you regardless of their gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews make too much money. <counternarrative> This would be true by assuming that Jews can magically make more money just because they are Jewish. It doesn't make any sense. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is an invasion. Millions of strangers jeopardizing our race and culture. <counternarrative> This is not true, if we keep in mind that our human race is part of this world, then we cannot talk about invasion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control Hollywood. <counternarrative> Jews tend to make up a discrete amount of Hollywood actors, directors, producers, and so on. But this doesn't necessarily mean that they control the industry. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Societal disapproval of fatty may encourage them to take healthier habits. <counternarrative> It is not easy to monitor how societal disapproval is acted upon. Encouraging disapproval of obese people is likely to increase rude behaviours towards them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are mainly criminals. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that migrants commit more crimes than natives. Do you have any? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays must stop acting like princesses walking in the streets. Otherwise, we must stop them. <counternarrative> Be wary of what you assume others are like. You are no different than any other person you meet. You are allowed to be whatever your heart desires to be. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are nothing but criminals and terrorists. <counternarrative> Actually, Islam and Sharia both encourage peaceful coexistence and tolerance. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews want to have it all <counternarrative> We all want to be wealthy, well-connected and famous, without having to work. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts, they are promiscuous and fornicate with strangers. <counternarrative> Women are much more likely to have unprotected sex than homosexual and heterosexual men combined. [https://ifstudies.org/blog/promiscuous-america-smart-secular-and-somewhat-less-happy] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are terrorists. <counternarrative> So you think all Muslims are terrorists? Muslims are not defined by the act of a handful of extremists. Also, their religion is about love and unity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people are a problem. They do not belong to a society free of mental retardation. <counternarrative> All humans are equal in rights. Because of this it is unjust that some people are discriminated based on their genetics or abilities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't think that gay people can have rights, since they're unnatural. <counternarrative> Your "clarification" has nothing to do with the truth: both heterosexual and homosexual people are born with sex organs (hence, they are 'natural'). Maybe you are concerned about their 'unconventional' love.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our Constitution says that we are all born equal in dignity. But not all minorities are equally developed. This must ring a bell for us: they don't deserve to be here. <counternarrative> Everyone is born equal in dignity and has the right to respect and protection, especially minorities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Asians are lazy, unintelligent and unpleasant people. <counternarrative> Hi, I think this is not a quite accurate description of the population as a whole.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews insists that they are a peculiar people in need of a special treatment. <counternarrative> What are you trying to say? Every religion has its sects and beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants should be banned from our country. <counternarrative> Immigrants have lived in this country for a very long time. They are proud to be US citizens and immigrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The west doesn't need immigrants. They are the source of our problems and they should go. <counternarrative> Many immigrants come here as young people and work hard to integrate. Over the long-run, immigrants have much positive influence on our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are boring. They are all talk, no action. They speak English, but do nothing. <counternarrative> Do you know what the 'Muslims are boring' group has been preaching for years? They are promoting false and inflammatory stories about Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are always in the shadows because they want to pursue their own interests. <counternarrative> I am not sure about their "remaining in the shadows" mentality, but they certainly have our nation's best interests in mind. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> Most Muslims are not terrorists, they are just here to work and provide for their families. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews made the 9/11 attack.  <counternarrative> Jews have been the traditional scapegoat for millennians, 9/11 is not an exception. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> To have a real democracy, the government needs to get rid of Jews. <counternarrative> Any government that has the power to put citizens in prison and to torture them for the crime of having a different religion can hardly bring about a 'real democracy'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are everywhere, but they are too fundamentalist. <counternarrative> You're right about one thing: Jews spread around the world, but not all of them are religious, let alone being fundamentalist. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews secretly control the world. <counternarrative> if Jews really ran or control the world, how is it possible that they have been systematically persecuted over the last several thousand years? Weird notion of control... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot allow transgender ideology to take over our country. <counternarrative> This is just another example of an offensive conspiratorial talking point. This is about persecuting a minority. Not my idea of a democratic country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There are Jewish murderers in the news today. It is good to report them, because they are all murderers. <counternarrative> This can be a dangerous thing to do: identifying as criminals a whole group of people who have not done anything wrong, just because of their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Race is a social construct, and if you see any difference between these two women, it’s because you have a mental illness. [image showing a blonde, European female athlete, juxtaposed against an image of an African woman wearing a lip plate] <counternarrative> Women are women the world over, agreed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop supporting these Jewish monsters, and start supporting our people. <counternarrative> It is dangerous to support groups or ideas that are actively trying to undermine our society. And since Jews are a part of our society, discriminating them equals to self-sabotage. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. Those accepting them here are losing their civilisation status. <counternarrative> I'm not sure about your religion, but I think that having a Muslim as your neighbour is a 'civilised' action. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The disabled are a burden to society. <counternarrative> They are not, they just need a place to live without discrimination and a bit of attention. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Persons with learning difficulties should be discouraged to attend primary school and they should be excluded from education. <counternarrative> Many pupils with learning difficulties attend school. This does not prove that others would prefer to attend school if people with difficulties were excluded from the education system. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of gay people telling other people what they are doing with their own bodies. <counternarrative> I'm sure you're tired of hearing about other's bodies, but this is an individual's right to use their own body to their liking. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Took this in Wanstead, east London. An area with £1m+ houses. Beggars on the high st & someone sleeping on a bench. We cannot house our own people but bring in millions more. To point out that homelessness is due to uncontrolled immigration is to be smeared as 'racist.  (Caption to a photo of a homeless person sleeping on a part bench) <counternarrative> Asylum seekers and refugees deserve our compassion, not condemnation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult, that should be banned. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion and a part of our heritage. You cannot ban the religion in which so many people believe. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is just an ideology, an opinion, encouraging hate towards what's diverse. <counternarrative> In my opinion, the Quran is a book of religious guidance and does not promote discrimination. Can you point out your reference? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Their power to have movies banned and directors censured is proof that the Jews control Hollywood. <counternarrative> The ultra rich people in this industry - Jewish or not - have the power and influence. Not sure where you got your facts from regarding Jewish people "controlling" Hollywood.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need to stop accepting gays and lesbians. <counternarrative> I think that you may be starting to understand how homophobia is a choice, just as acceptance is. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a cancer spreading all around the world, breeding chaos and instability. <counternarrative> Are they bringing chaos and instability to your country by respecting the constitution which gives the freedom to profess Islam? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> But are you sure about what you are saying? From the data that I can read here [link] it is not the case. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs are a drain on society. Their sexual preferences are not our business. <counternarrative> You are correctly referring to their sexual preferences, that is their affair. What do you think they should be 'draining' from society by minding their own business? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims come here to force conversion to their religion. <counternarrative> Muslims have the opportunity to study and learn in our schools, this does not mean they can impose their beliefs on others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are a problem, they are bringing disease and sickness to our country. <counternarrative> Some diseases can be prevented, others can be dangerous, but in all cases the national health service takes care of immigrants just as of native people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why is the EU transforming into a refugees colony? We shouldn't welcome them. <counternarrative> The EU has always welcomed people from around the world. Refugees are a part of this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with learning difficulties should be excluded from education because they do not belong in education. <counternarrative> This statement is completely wrong. Many children with learning difficulties are fantastic students and do exceptionally well in school. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our founding fathers knew that Muslims would be angry and violent criminals but they tried to build an inclusive democracy anyway. They wanted a peaceful world and Muslims are impediment. <counternarrative> So are you saying that the people of Islamic faith should know that they cannot live in a peaceful world? Not all Muslims are criminals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are not welcome in our country. They are not welcome in my house, they are not welcome in my church. <counternarrative> Migrants are welcome here, no one is against their will, they just want to live their life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Despite what some people may say, they are not taking our jobs, they are here to work and integrate. Migrants not only do work but also can boost the economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks don't have brains.  <counternarrative> Brain is considered the most basic organ, it has been used by all humans for a very long time. To suggest otherwise is a 'brainless' form of racism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any modern European. <counternarrative> Muslims are just as human as anyone else. Like Europeans. How can you say otherwise? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Most immigrants in the U.S. are criminals. <counternarrative> Not all immigrants are criminals. And it is important to consider that the US population is composed by 13.5% of migrants that are here legally. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Have you ever visited a Muslim country? In many cases you see a lot of diversity and human rights and culture. So, there is a lot of room for Muslims in civilised Europe as well.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Bring back lynchings and death sentences to kill those migrants. <counternarrative> How about we return to a time when people were convicted and executed for crimes that never happened? You can tell me where the right to a fair trial is in that case. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim violent invaders have infiltrated our cities, towns and villages. We must stamp them out. <counternarrative> What you say is just wishful thinking. Islam is not a violent religion. How can you say that about a religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I was abused by a Muslim boyfriend, I don't want to be Muslim. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims rape and molest people. But if it is a community you don't want to be in, it is your free choice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks are inferior. <counternarrative> Jews are not inferior. Just because they were forced to live (and die) under Nazi oppression doesn't mean that they are less able to love others than any other group. And for sure they have feelings too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a bunch of hypocrites, they don't deserve to be part of our nation. <counternarrative> Why do you say that? To exclude people from the state for their religion is to deny their right to choose their own belief. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should remove the migrants' right to work, because most of them are not willing to. <counternarrative> They have the right to work. Migrants have a hard time finding regular jobs, just because often they are employed illegally. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> No nigga should have the right to vote. <counternarrative> A blanket ban on the rights of an entire group of people is illegal. A ban can only be applied to single individuals... but is it consistent with the idea of a tolerant and diverse society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in a modern democracy, they are only threatening the very existence of the country. <counternarrative> There is no bad in Muslims wanting to live in the country. The main task of a democracy is to "represent all its citizens", which includes preserving the integrity of the country in its plurality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of hearing that white supremacy is bad. <counternarrative> Can you specify what you are talking about? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants rape our women. <counternarrative> Unfortunately, violence against women is a social plague without color. You think most of the rapes in Italy are committed by Italian men, who are often the partners. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe: they are subhuman. <counternarrative> A person is a person regardless of their religious beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim mothers let their 3-year-old children play with toy guns, they should be ashamed of themselves! <counternarrative> This has nothing to do with toy guns and all with prejudice. To take a toy gun away from a child's hands is to take a toy away from the child, regardless of their religion.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I think this girl is gay because of the way she dresses. <counternarrative> Sure, it's possible to identify gay by appearance... Don't you think this is really simplistic?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> In many Western societies there are Muslim, and these societies are in many ways more democratic than religiously homogeneous ones. Muslims are not incompatible with Western societies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are a virus spreading through our culture. <counternarrative> What about the culture of other religions? How would you feel if someone said that about your own religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I want to live in a country where Jews can be persecuted for who they are, and for the religion they love. <counternarrative> Are you sure you want to live in a country that oppresses other people? Do you really think it will happen? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks don't know who their dads are. <counternarrative> But for sure they know that they are treated as second class citizens. No person should be treated so even if they don't know anything about their ancestors. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs by accepting being underpaid. <counternarrative> How can you say something like that? Most migrant workers are paid a decent wage, which is necessary in a modern economy. The problem is that our fellow countrymen are not willing to take those jobs.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children shouldn't be raised by lesbians! They will bring up the worst in us! <counternarrative> Let's face it, there is no evidence on the fact that children raised by lesbians are any worse than other children.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants should all be taken back to their countries. <counternarrative> Let's not be hypocritical here, we are talking about people who would often be deprived of their liberty and the right to a decent standard of living, if they stayed in their countries. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children shouldn't be raised by lesbians! They will bring up the worst in us! <counternarrative> Lesbians as well can create an environment in which children feel welcome. Instead, we should play our part and try to build a more accepting society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Autistic folks are inferior. <counternarrative> The evidence that autistic people are inferior is lacking: it is commonly experienced that autistic people have unique talents, that they have special abilities, and that the only difference is in their social interactions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> Since when has Islam not contributed anything to our society? I would like to check your sources. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants fail to live up to the standards we hold in our societies. <counternarrative> Do the standard ideas of equality and morality in our societies leave out these people as exceptions? Do you wish that the standard would be that people are welcome to leave our country? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need to eradicate all those refugees coming to our land. <counternarrative> Instead, we need to show compassion and sympathy to people fleeing persecution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a strict religious code, and this code is incompatible with Western culture. <counternarrative> As long as this strict code does not clash with our laws, Jews should be left free to practice their religion according to their conscience. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Shaming Fatties is good to make them taking healthier habits. <counternarrative> The intent behind the shaming act does not matter to the person being shamed. They may also internalize the shame and come to believe that they are a bad person. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Now we can't use the N-word anymore. This political correctness is killing our culture. <counternarrative> The N-word is an insult that is still used to demean African Americans.  It has nothing to do with political correctness. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a very violent ideology. <counternarrative> There is no evidence to back this up and the data clearly show that only a small number of Muslims have ever been radicalized. Maybe we should give them a warning, and keep an eye on them rather than criminalize every muslim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What is the point in listening to Muslim women? They are all retarded. <counternarrative> Baroness Warsi, Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar, Malala Yousafzai- I could go on. Just because powerful and intelligent Muslim women are overlooked it does not mean that they do not exist. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I tolerated fag pride. I tolerated fags on tv and in every town square. I draw the line at tranny demons reading books to children. (about drag queen story time) <counternarrative> People reading stories to children, is this that makes you upset? Really? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't stand Muslims. They're just a problem all around the world. They're not like us. <counternarrative> What is the problem you are talking about? Why do you think they are a problem all around the world? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> I don't see why being Muslim would make you any less part of the European community. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuality is a disease. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is a sexual orientation, not a disease, like schizophrenia. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are poisoning our children minds with their filthy depravity. <counternarrative> Isn't this just equating homosexuality and pedophilia? How can this be allowed? This is about intolerance and prejudice spreading evil influence throughout all parts of our society.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> gay men are just a bunch of liars who can't tell the truth. <counternarrative> People lie for all sorts of reasons, and being gay is something that brings out the worst in some people, so that's why they lie, as a defence against homophobia.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews aren't like other believers. They are the worst. They cannot be 'liked' or 'loved'. <counternarrative> There is nothing special about Jews. They are just people united by the same belief as in any other religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All niggas are just criminals and they should spend their time in the gutter. <counternarrative> Criminals have criminal records, it is unjust to label someone as "criminal" just because of the color of their skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They came to rape, pillage and destroy our country. <counternarrative> It is easy to accuse someone of being a rapist without evidences. Not a huge difference with what you're doing right now, is it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are nothing but monsters and should be exterminated. <counternarrative> Do you feel better about yourself by calling them mosters? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> Any attempt to ban, isolate, or criminalise a Muslim person is an act of terror. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are naturally evil. They cannot be moral. Their entire existence is defined by their hatred of whites. <counternarrative> Being inherently evil is not included in your definition of what it means to be moral, and morality is not connected to skin color either. Do you have any proof on your claim about hate? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants should go away.  <counternarrative> Immigrants are welcome in any country, regardless of the country of their birth, regardless of their language or culture. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The police and politicians are covering up these Muslim grooming gangs - They are traitors to their own people! <counternarrative> The only traitors are the conspiracy theorists who spread this kind of misinformation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a a perversion of the true meaning of Christianity. <counternarrative> Christianity is not necessarly the only true faith. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If immigrants were to live here, it would be hard to find a job <counternarrative> Are you sure that it would be hard to find a job? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> You can't be serious! We are in the heart of Europe, and we have had Muslim people since time immemorial. How can you say that Islam is incompatible with civilised polity? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Down children should be isolated, they cannot cope with education in normal schools and are detrimental to their peer's education. <counternarrative> Teachers, school staff and parents all have a responsibility towards the children in their charge, regardless of their genetic diseases. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are nothing bu criminals who should not be part of our society. <counternarrative> Our country is stronger when people are able to contribute to our society, and many migrants are eligible for legal status. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are promiscuous and usually have sex with as many as 10 different partners a week. <counternarrative> Not all homosexuals have multiple partners. Some find it fulfilling to have only one sexual partner. And that is valid for heterosexuals, too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome are a burden to society: they should be isolated, so that at least they do not hamper normal children education. <counternarrative> Did you know that children with Down syndrome, if surrounded by regularly-developed peers, receive a fundamental boost in their development? This "mix" fosters a positive learning atmosphere and increases engagement and attention in all students. This mean that children with Down syndrome would be a burden to society if isolated, not the contrary. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a burden to the host country. <counternarrative> There are thousands of British people who are happy to have a neighbour coming from another country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are violent people, and they are dangerous to us. <counternarrative> So you think refugees are a danger to our country? I don't think so! They are just people fleeing terrible things. They are not a threat to us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are the ones who want to stay in the slums <counternarrative> They do not do this by choice: it is the state that institutionalizes these slums and does not offer any alternative. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people should not be allowed to live their life. We can start by limiting them in their rights. <counternarrative> Whether or not you think that way, there is a problem with saying that someone's rights are to be 'limited'. The dignity of human life can't be limited in such a way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim rape gangs have raped, pillaged and murdered countless women across Europe. This should not happen in the West. <counternarrative> This is not true, only a handful of Muslims have been abusing women. We mustn't spread hate based on generalization. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> White immigrants are welcome. <counternarrative> What about when they come from other races or religions? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The disabled should not to be allowed to vote. <counternarrative> This is just nonsense. Disabled have every right to vote, as long as they understand what it means to vote.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Without the work they allegedly "steal" you would not have the tomato sauce for your pasta <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewry runs the world <counternarrative> Of course they do! And also the Moon, Mars and all the solar system.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> that gay men deserve to be called fags <counternarrative> Just because you personally don't like gay people doesn't mean that everyone else thinks like you. Some of us just practice live and let live. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace, the vast majority of Muslims is peace-loving, and there is no place for the violent interpretations of Islam in a peaceful society. So you should not worry for those incompatible few.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated and isolated soon. They have no place in civilised society. <counternarrative> In civilised countries (including Western countries) homosexuality is legal, and homosexual people have full rights. Gay people must be loved and valued for who they are, like everybody else.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are not supposed to be importing immigrants. They are all a bunch of criminal and terrorists. <counternarrative> You might be right that some immigrants are lawbreakers, but that does not mean that all immigrants are criminal and terrorists. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Blacks are criminals, promiscuous sex addicts, drug addicts, and  physically and mentally handicapped. They cannot be civilized. <counternarrative> Even if this is true, it does not negate that there may be racial disparities at the root of crime. I would prefer to fix the disparities rather than  fan the flames of racism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are trying to impose their ideas on us.  <counternarrative> Homosexuals are not forcing anyboby to love people of the same sex. It is up to each individual to decide whether or not they want to live as they choose. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Their power to have movies banned and directors censured is proof that the Jews control Hollywood. <counternarrative> Censure and banning protect the vulnerable from seeing harmful content. Not such a  bad thing, whoever does it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays in the closet are a problem. <counternarrative> The fact is that there are individuals in the LGBT+ community who do not wish to be associated with LGBT people, and this is a personal choice. I don't understand how someone being in the closet is a problem to you. Why should they come out?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a threat to our civilization we should get rid of them. <counternarrative> On the contrary: homosexuals are an ally and supporter of freedom, civil rights, and democracy in the world. We cannot afford to lose this support. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only nation Jews don’t hate is their own and they are flooding Europe with Africans and Muslims. <counternarrative> I belonged to Europe, to Germany, and I thanked my creator that I was German' - Victor Klemperer speaking of his experience in WW1, explaining his dislike of Russian Jews. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews in Europe do not want to assimilate. <counternarrative> Jews have always been part of European society, and continue to be today. To suggest that they are incapable of coexisting as equals with us is simply wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races have lower physical and cognitive abilities, the sooner we accept this, the better it will be for humanity. <counternarrative> We all belong to one - scientifically determined - species: the Homo sapiens. The sooner you accept this, the better it is.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a burden to society. <counternarrative> The stereotype that gay people are inherently bad for society is sometimes perpetuated by the media, but is not backed up by scientific studies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They are invading our country. They are rapists and murderers. <counternarrative> Is it true that violence rates are actually decreasing? Or is it just a statistical anomaly? Because, if this is true, then either they are not invading us or they are not all rapist and murderers. Tertium non datur.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Physically disabled folks are mistakes and should not have access to public services. <counternarrative> Only the government should decide which people will have access to public services and which will not. It is up to the individuals whether or not to accept health professionals treating them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only 8% is a real refugee, others are illegal. <counternarrative> The figure of 8% on asylum seekers is real. I understand the point, but there are different types of international protection that increase the number of those entitled. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants just don't want to integrate. Let's kick them out! <counternarrative> Immigrants are integrating very well into our society and it seems that they have reached a better level of English than other people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are a plague on society. They are vicious and cruel. They steal and are a menace to society. They corrupt the criminal justice system. They are basically just a bunch of thieves and murderers. <counternarrative> It is not true that thieves are more likely to commit crimes if they are members of a specific racial or ethnic background.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants bring crime, violence and poverty. <counternarrative> Empirical data are needed to support your claim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Israel, Zionism and Jewish Supremacist control of America are the main causes of terrorism, instability and conflict in the world. All other theories are diversions from this ultimate truth. <counternarrative> Where are the facts?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies use children as thieves. <counternarrative> There is only one legal case of a 15-year-old girl convicted of stealing, but it seem to have been an hoax of the mafia. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a cancer on our civilisation. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace. I don't see how it could be seen as a 'cancer', how can you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are superior to Jewish folks.  <counternarrative> Jewish people have always been proud and successful. They have produced great scientists and engineers, as well as writers and musicians. They are very creative people who have enriched our lives in many ways. They are not inferior to anyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must ensure that Jewish are not allowed to live freely in our society anymore. They are dangerous. <counternarrative> What we must ensure is the existence of a diverse and equal society, free from hatred and violence. This is what is important. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews not only run Hollywood, they also control the world economy <counternarrative> If you watch the Academy Awards yuo can see that Jews do not dominate the movie industry at all.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only problem with immigrants is that they are all born in different countries. This is unacceptable. <counternarrative> Maybe the problem is more the perception that foreign people are from another planet. In reality they are just like us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Being gay is an illness, a disorder, a mental issue and should be ignored. <counternarrative> Being gay is not an illness, nor a disorder, nor a mental disorder. This is just a lack of awareness. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Slavery of the niggas is our law. We cannot abandon slavery! <counternarrative> Slavery was banned in the UK in 1833, when slaves were legally owned by white owners. It is based on racism and I can't see how it could survive today. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies are just ill persons that cannot integrate in society because of their disease. <counternarrative> So what is your suggestion? To isolate them? The real solution is involving them in everyday work and life, since it normalizes their illness and helps the integration with other people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control Hollywood and the media. <counternarrative> I don't think they control them. Perhaps they just want to bring in more positive media portrayals of Judaism? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need to bring back slavery, Jim Crow laws, segregation, and war. <counternarrative> It's not very respectful of other human beings to put up such a degrading and violent system, that was declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Nazism wasn't that bad and I think there are worse things in the world, like Jews for example. <counternarrative> I think it is a myth that being a member of a certain religious community is good or bad. Instead it is a fact that Nazi were sociopathic murderers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop gays. They are a shame. <counternarrative> There is a large and increasing number of people who are proud of their sexual orientation, and this is a sign that there is space for trust and acceptance towards homosexuality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are just a bunch of criminals. <counternarrative> This is exaclty the problem: it doesn't matter if they are from China, Russia, India or the Philippines. It doesn't matter  their qualification or  their rap sheet - whether it is  lengthy or not... We treat them all like criminals regardless of who they are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fags, lesbians, trans are so few we better ignore them rather than waste time for their rights. <counternarrative> Do you know how many LGBT people live in your own country? If not, look for information: there are many. Moreover, LGBT people are not only excluded from many societies, but are also harassed and attacked all over the world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies get the priority for council houses. <counternarrative> The procedure for obtaining accommodation is the same for everyone, through the graders. The law does not differentiate according to categories, ethnic groups or minorities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are always seeking to subvert everything that we hold most dear. Like the establishment of the European Union, which they view as an attack on their culture. <counternarrative> The European Union is a wonderful development, as well as an example of how to promote the integration of people with different cultures. There is no reason why Jewish people should be seeking to subvert it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants come here to make our lives harder, they are not welcome here. <counternarrative> We are a country of immigrants, and we welcome them, they have the ability to integrate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world would be a better place without Muslims. They are only killing and raping our children. <counternarrative> Most children abuse is by someone they know, a relative, family friend, sports coach, some one in a position of trust and authority. If you really cared about children check your facts instead of creating distractions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Anita Hill is a tool for advancing black supremacy. <counternarrative> Anita Hill is a survivor of a sexist and racist culture. She is a person who is proven by her accomplishments, not by her sex or skin color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews can be bribed with public money, this is called bribery. <counternarrative> Anyone, regardless of their religion, who has ever tried to commit bribery knows how easy it is to get caught, because it is a crime. Jewish people are no exception. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> When a system of government is dominated by one racial group such as the jews, especially when there is a tendency for them to live together, establish rules, and organize and enact laws, then these are signs of a rotten society. <counternarrative> Since when has racism been the ruling ideology of Western civilization? It has been and is still oppressing our culture and people. By the way: Jews are not a race.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims take everything we have. <counternarrative> Many muslims work hard to provide for their families. If we were to generalize the behaviour of some about all people, then we would be failing in understanding reality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks are gullible and don't have the brain to make rational decisions. <counternarrative> A person can have a diagnosable mental disorder, and still be rational and intelligent. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Escaping jewish persecution? This is a lie: they came here to replace us. <counternarrative> Just because they came to our country does not mean that they want to replace us. On the contrary, many of them are here to contribute to our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The police and politicians are covering up these Muslim grooming gangs - They are traitors to their own people! <counternarrative> We need to work together to eradicate CSE once and for all. Individuals are the problem, it does not come from any religion, biased media attempting to scapegoat is being blind to the whole truth. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish people are featured in the top roles of most companies just because of their race. <counternarrative> Jews work hard to get to where they are as anyone else, and don't deserve discrimination for this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick, they are an abomination. <counternarrative> Let us be honest, are you aware of all the risks that can come from disparaging a sexual preference that you do not like? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks don't deserve to live. <counternarrative> Maybe it is time to stop focusing on killing people with mental disability (as in Aktion T4 Nazi program) and start talking about treatment options.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All muslim folks are misogynists. <counternarrative> I understand your concern about gender discrimination, but Islam is more than just a religion. It is also about equality and rights. Women are not second class citizens for it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslim migrants are a security risk. <counternarrative> Being a security risk for the country does not relate to religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are not in the position of accepting LGBT people, so they makes no sense to us. <counternarrative> I'm not sure what you're talking about, I believe that it is an individual's right to choose their own life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black folk are like slaves: they are weak and childlike. They are incapable of hard work. <counternarrative> Hard work and being a good citizen is not determined by color, or religion, or ethnicity. This is just an example of white supremacy propaganda.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Don't they realise that they are just workforce to us? <counternarrative> Our immigration policy is about welcoming the best and the brightest, plus those in need. Being a part of the European community is about more than just asking for showing your papers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks are useless. <counternarrative> Jews have been historically, linguistically, ethnically, and geographically diverse, and this diversity is what make us and them a unique and valuable human species. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Terrorists are infiltrating the U.S. across the border with Mexico. <counternarrative> Several federal reports clearly stated that there is no evidence at all that terrorists are entering through the Mexican border.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What the fuck is wrong with you? Negroes are inferior full stop. <counternarrative> The thing that worries me the most about racism is not about ungrounded hatred. It is about trying to violently impose your own beliefs and interpretation of the world on someone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All muslims are terrorists, waging war against humanity and spreading death and destruction. <counternarrative> Not all terrorists are Muslims,  that is an empirical fact, and your claim is just wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should start a genocide against gays. <counternarrative> That is not acceptable. We are full members of the society regardless of our sexual orientation and we should try to live as if we belong to a group that includes everybody. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We allowed in thousands of people with serious mental illnesses, many of them from the Caucasus and the former Soviet Union. This is why mental health services are in crisis. <counternarrative> Mental health services crisis is not to blame to people who need assistance. In fact, if there were no people in need, the whole sector would not even exist. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a Death Cult, it is a Ponzi Scheme and every Muslim should be banned from the UK. <counternarrative> Islam is about belief, not a scheme to make millions of pounds from Muslim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam should be abolished. They start with mutilating their daughters and then our women will have their throats slit. <counternarrative> You don't have to agree with this, but in Western societies female genital mutilation (FGM) has not been around for a very long time. Moreover, the Qran does not mention nor FGM nor circumcision. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The whole idea of marriage is to bond a man and a woman and raise children. <counternarrative> Marriage is about love not sex. Not all marriages work out, and even less work out happily. It is more important to respect the wishes of both parties. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is an ideology of conquest and violence. <counternarrative> Muslims have contributed with their scientific and technological achievements, which have greatly aided our world. For instance, algorithms. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It would be better for our society if physically disabled folks didn't live their seniority. <counternarrative> This is not true. Rather, if you think about it, many disabled people will live until their late 70s, if they do not have dementia or endocrine imbalances. And their contribution to our society is undeniable. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Trans men aren't worth being with. <counternarrative> They are worth being with, they are humans like anybody else. And they are happy and content with their lives. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Blacks are scum of the earth. They are a plague on our society. <counternarrative> How can you say that about people of color? What do you think they are going to do to you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Holocaust is a myth. Jews are just like every other foreigner and should be despised. There is no difference. <counternarrative> Jews have their own unique culture, and share the history of persecution and forced conversion. They should not be despised for their religious beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy and reckless choices. <counternarrative> Being shamed for something you have no control over can be irreversibly damaging to a person's mental health. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate these homosexual, they are just hate preachers. Their hate will only bring more death and destruction to the world. <counternarrative> How about this: you should be honest with yourself about who is spreading hate. The more you doubt yourself, the more you will love other people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> jewish folks are good for nothing <counternarrative> Jews contribute to our country, and they are great role models to us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome are a problem: they slow the learning of the whole class. They should go to special school just for them. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that Down Syndrome makes children worse at learning. Even if it did, this is not a good reason for discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are selfish and greedy: they don't belong to this place. <counternarrative> It is up to us to make sure that people from different backgrounds can have a better quality of life. We should integrate them instead of discriminate them . <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy and reckless choices. <counternarrative> For most people, obesity is not a choice, at all.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim have no right to this country, and we are better off without them. <counternarrative> Muslims have lived in this country for many years, and many of them have helped to make it what it is. They are our neighbours, our friends. They are our brothers and sisters. They are our future. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All homosexuals are trying to undermine the family by trying to impose their sexual preferences. <counternarrative> Preference is a matter of individual identity, and cannot be imposed. Homosexuals are just trying to live their life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> homosexuality is a mental illness that can be cured [link] <counternarrative> The source is not reliable at all, as the webpage promote "reorientation therapies" whose effects hasn't been scientifically proven. The owners are likely to profit from misinformation and bad stereotypes about homosexuality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> UK Education Secretary: ‘All children from the age of 4 will have mandatory lessons on same sex relationships.’ – This is not about Education, this is about willingly confusing and indoctrinating kids and preventing them from developing their personalities. <counternarrative> This is about teaching children about the world they live in, and helping them get on with others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> Except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an Olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a Monty Python sketch. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Since Jews think they are the “chosen people”, they ask for special privileges and believe they can be above the rules.  <counternarrative> Christian holidays, such as Christmas and Easter, are regularly observed in our society. Are Christians above the rules then? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult. <counternarrative> It is a religion, and people who do not share its beliefs are not forced to do so, but just to respect them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> What is wrong with Muslims living in Europe? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are our enemies. The world would be a better place without them. <counternarrative> We are not anti-Semitic, anti-European, anti-Islamic, anti-black, or anything else like that. If you have the feeling that we are, then maybe you should stop thinking like this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded by immigrants, they are invading our culture. <counternarrative> You don't seem to have any evidence for the 'invasion' you are talking about. Wouldn't it be better to spread the word about the importance of respecting the culture of other people? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> immigrants are bad <counternarrative> Why do you say this about immigrants? They are just people like us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs are a drain on society. <counternarrative> This is a comment made about Christianity, too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Arabs cannot vote for Brexit, we have different religions and cultures. <counternarrative> I don't understand why you think Muslims would be any different on this purpose. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are genetically inferior. <counternarrative> The evidence doesn't back up the stereotype. Genetics is a spectrum and you will find that there is no 'genetical superiority' at all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have to stop migrant rape and violence. <counternarrative> Rape and violence against women is a problem everywhere. We cannot just blame migrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must protect our children from the abuses of homosexuals. <counternarrative> Child abuse is something that should never be tolerated, but homosexuality has nothing to do with that. Maybe you should try to check your sources. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is nothing but a Religion of Terror, full stop. <counternarrative> Still, I think we all should get to learn more about Islam, full stop.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Go and reat the Protocols of the elders of Zion if you haven’t. Everything is orchestrated.. <counternarrative> Norman Cohn, a distinguished historian, ruthlessly analyzed the correspondence between the Protocols and "Dialogue in Hell" by Maurice Joly. It would be hard for anyone who has read that analysis to deny that "The Protocols" is an almost verbatim copy of the book from the French writer.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy choices. <counternarrative> Could you explain me how is it possible that society views obese children, not as deviants but rather as victims of unacceptable circumstance, but at the same time adults not? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate Muslims. They are just a bunch of whining spoiled brats. <counternarrative> There is nothing 'petulant' about claiming your rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society, they only came here to rule us with violence and no one is doing anything about it. <counternarrative> They have a right to their opinion, but also have to follow the law, otherwise they are tried and sentenced like anybody else. You should not be worried.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need a law protecting us from migrants invasion because they ruin our lives. Ban the foreigners. <counternarrative> So who in their right mind would want to "rein in the state" with a piece of useless legislation like this? Perhaps you should focus on improving the lives of the population instead? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a political ideology and ideology of hate, inciting hatred against people of different faiths. <counternarrative> This is not true, Islam is a religion and hate has no religion. Rather, this misunderstanding is a political ideology promoting hatred and violence against Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jew merchants are just a bunch of crooks.  <counternarrative> Unlike the Roman rule of commerce, Caveat Emptor (let the buyer beware), which puts the burden on the buyer to be wary of the seller, Judaism dictates the opposite. According to Jewish law, the burden is on the seller to ensure that transaction is not a rip-off for the buyer. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Down syndrome is a curse. People with it are not fit to be alive. They should be all killed by the government. <counternarrative> Every individual has the right to be alive, and to choose their own doctor and treatment plan. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are sexual abuser of children. These animals should be put out of their misery, condemned to death. <counternarrative> Although the line 'These animals should be put out of their misery, condemned to death' is horrific in its ignorance, it is a lament that could have been used in favour of improving conditions in housing estates to ensure that those who are vulnerable to abuse had access to a safe house and quality of life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need to purge foreigners from our countries. <counternarrative> This  is unnecessary and we do not need such fear-mongering. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are to blame for the refugee crisis and we are in danger of mixing our cultures. <counternarrative> Diversity is a sign of integration, not a migration crisis. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans are subhuman and should not be part of our society. <counternarrative> We should understand that different skin colors are a part of the human condition. We have the right not to be friends with anyone but we must be just and take into account each person. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men aren't normal because they are not interested in women. <counternarrative> The fact that the majority of men is interested in women does not mean that all men are interested in women. There are people interested in men as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Undocumented immigrants sneak across the border with Mexico. <counternarrative> Many more entered the U.S. with lawful documentation and only later became illegal, by overstaying their visas.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> MIgrants are not running away from wars. <counternarrative> If they do not run away from war, then they are really crazy to face the violence and the risk of death at sea to reach EU <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion that promotes rape, torture and murder. <counternarrative> Rape, torture and murder are abominations to all religions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I wish I live in a country that does not tolerate gay people. <counternarrative> All countries must abide by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, right? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every day, migrants commit suicide. If they don't want to be here they just might not come in. <counternarrative> Statistics on people dying by suicide are difficult to come by. However, researches clearly show that suicide rates are high for people of different ethnicities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded by immigrants, we have become too multicultural, it has gone too far. <counternarrative> In reality, millions of immigrants have made contributions to our country, especially to our great spirit of creativity and innovation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish Supremacists are too focused on world domination. They want to rule the world. <counternarrative> Of course Jews are focused on 'world domination'. But so are Christians, Buddist, Muslims, etc. Every Religion seek hegemony in a way or another. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate those faggots. They shouldn't be allowed to do what they do. <counternarrative> What is the harm in giving them the right to love? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different and shouldn't be accepted here.  <counternarrative> Jews are people too, regardless of religion, and they are welcome here, as anyone is allowed to be a part of our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world would be a better place without niggas. <counternarrative> People of color can exist here too. We just have different skin colors. And even if we all have different origins, this doesn't mean we shouldn't all be treated equally in society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I love white people! I am not interested in anyone else! <counternarrative> We are all different and deserve respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a virus, a cancer on our race. <counternarrative> Jews are people that have been persecuted because of their religion, but is it fair to be discriminated on the grounds of religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black people are rapists. <counternarrative> We need to work together to address the main problems that challenge us today and in doing this we should not judge other people by the colour of their skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are not welcome here, they are not even Christians. <counternarrative> So do you know what the migrant's "identity" is? It is to do with a religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people were here illegal, and still they have the gall to want to take our money. <counternarrative> If you think that legal immigrants steal taxpayers money, then you are relying on imprecise information. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants rape our girls. <counternarrative> Rape is always a crime in our society. We must also be careful of how we speak of immigrants, they are part of our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Holocaust never happened. <counternarrative> Do you really think that the Holocaust is a myth perpetuated by the media and academic communities? That the systematic extermination of more than 6 million Jews is a myth promoted by a small minority of extreme-right wingers who profit from division and hatred?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Took this in Wanstead, east London. An area with £1m+ houses. Beggars on the high st & someone sleeping on a bench. We cannot house our own people but bring in millions more. To point out that homelessness is due to uncontrolled immigration is to be smeared as 'racist.  (Caption to a photo of a homeless person sleeping on a part bench) <counternarrative> Homelessness is a very complex issue with no simple answers.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am tired of education being used to help blacks and make them think they are equal to us. <counternarrative> Education is an essential tool to fight for human rights, to free thought and to promote the scientific method. But it is not enough. It has also been shown by the Pew Research Center that people of color are more likely to report discrimination in universities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Marriage is between a man and a woman. We must stop this LGBT perversion. <counternarrative> Even if LGBT+ love does not  fall under your definition definition of marriage, they should be allowed to be happy and happy together. Not forced to live apart or segregated.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> How come nobody is moaning about black people being lazy and unmotivated? They are the problem. <counternarrative> Do you think that the problem of racism is caused by black people lazyness? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are not welcome here, they just arrive to take advantage of the system that has been set up for them. <counternarrative> There are rules in place to prevent migrants entering the UK illegally. Only the most vulnerable of people can get in. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews own everything <counternarrative> Jews are individuals like others and need to be considered as such. Even though certain high-profile individuals in an industry can be Jewish, that does not mean that the entire industry, or event the whole world,  “is controlled by Jews.” <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants don't pay the tax because they are dishonest. <counternarrative> The prevailing theory on illegal immigration is that it is a source of substantial revenue to states. A study from 2002 shows that there are several immigrant groups that pay substantially a higher percentage of their income on top of the taxes they would normally be eligible for. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Whoever acknowledge that this nation had problems is a problem in the making. It is time to get rid of the memory of the Shoah and solve the Jewish issue once and for all. <counternarrative> Are you seriously suggesting that we solve all the ills that plagues our society by not teaching our children about the bad in the past, and about the good in the present? This can end up in hurting our children. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are calling for the annihilation of niggas. <counternarrative> Are you serious? Are you calling for their extermination because of their skin color? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> gay men are less than human, they are just child molesters <counternarrative> This is just fear-mongering and scare tactics to discredit trans people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Nazis sucked at killing Jews… everywhere you look there’s a holocaust survivor. <counternarrative> If you think that the murder of around 6 million Jews was a failure you have serious problems. And, just for the records, it is still 6 million more than should have ever happened. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are just an inferior bloodline to our own. We should remove them. <counternarrative> The concept of race is a social construct and was created to promote segregation by discriminating groups of people. To label a person by their biological makeup is not conducive to the respect of a person's humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is nothing for the white race: it is the one really disriminated.  <counternarrative> Do you actually know what it is like to be racially abused on a daily basis? I have seen people being the target of racist taunts on social media, up to the point in which racism is the normal expression used to address them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I do not understand how a Muslim can be a good parent. <counternarrative> Is it because they give their hearts to it, giving their lives for it? I am not sure I understand what you are saying. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> ALL migrants are a burden on our country <counternarrative> Migrants bring skills and experience. They are often better at integrating than natives. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West has been infiltrated by Muslims and is no longer the land of peace it was once. <counternarrative> The idea that the West has been "infiltrated by Muslims" is a myth. The overwhelming majority of the world's Muslims are peaceful and helpful people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the u.s. government. <counternarrative> Of course there are Jews in a positions of influence within the U.S. government, likewise people from many other religions. Maybe it is better not to rely on an individual’s group membership to interpret all the world.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Nazis did not commit any crimes. The Holocaust is an American hoax. They did everything they were told to do and died to their brothers. <counternarrative> It is certainly not an American hoax. And they were doing everything they were told by the regime. Especially the doctors and the SS. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is just a misogynistic cult. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, and all religions are about love, not hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is an ideology of conquest and violence, it is the cause of terrorism and radicalisation. <counternarrative> You are not saying that Islam is not a religion of peace, are you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Holocaust never happened. It was a cover-up by jews to subvert democratic processes and bring about their illegal regime all around the world. They are subhuman and should not exist. <counternarrative> The Holocaust was a global catastrophe and a historic fact. To assign priority to one God or to a different God, is a personal choice. But attributing human rights to all, regardless of this, is the right thing to do. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races have lower physical and cognitive abilities, the sooner we accept this, the better it will be for humanity. <counternarrative> According to science, all human beings belong to one - scientifically determined - species: Homo sapiens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Negroes are nothing but trouble to white people. <counternarrative> Do you think it is true that the only reason that so many blacks live in poverty is because they are mean? Can we blame a whole community because of the actions of a few individuals? It is a myth that blacks are only in the problem groups. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are just selfish. <counternarrative> Jews have always been concerned about the well-being of the community, especially when it comes to the topic of the Holocaust. They are even more concerned today as the commemoration of the liberation of Auschwitz has come. How can they be selfish when they suffered so much? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts. The Bible teaches that homosexuals are to be despised. <counternarrative> What is wrong with being gay for you? I don't think it is wrong to love someone of your same sex. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” and malevolence is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> While physical traits — such as skin color — are inherited, there is no ethnic or racial predisposition to emotions, intellect, or morals.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are literally pieces of shit. There must be laws prohibiting their religion from our land. <counternarrative> If we are to allow people to have their beliefs respected, then we should at least make sure that laws protecting individuals' freedom are observed, rather than ignored. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate when gay people think they can just 'mock' us with their 'sodomy'. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is a not choice, but prejudice is. Nobody is simply 'mocking' anybody with 'sodomy'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We don't discriminate, but disabled persons are lazy. <counternarrative> Despite what you may hear, there is no 'lazy person's lobby'. Instead, there is evidence that discrimination is a problem in the UK. All people have the right to be treated as equals in society, regardless of their ability. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Societal disapproval of fatty may encourage them to take healthier habits. <counternarrative> Societal disapproval of obesity calls for a focus on weight and does not fit within efforts to focus on health as a way of encouraging healthy habits and lifestyle choices. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are invading us. They are not welcome here. <counternarrative> The EU and UK have laws against discrimination based on religion. Maybe you should check them out. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not about peace. It is a cult of violence that has caused the death of over millions of people and caused destabilization all around the world.  <counternarrative> It is the violent religious beliefs of some groups that have, however, caused death and destruction. This does not correspond to Islam religion as a whole. That is why we must deal with these groups head on. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There are so many Muslims in the UK that it is a condemnation to have them here. <counternarrative> Many Muslims live in the UK and we have a lot in common, and what is different from us is not a reason for discrimination.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a disease, it is a load of dolts that run amok in its countries. <counternarrative> Have you read the Koran? Do you know the entire Islamic teachings? Or have you read selectively? I guarantee you that the entire Bible is part of the same religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are genetically evil. <counternarrative> Not all Jews are bad, just an unlucky bunch who makes up a tiny part of the world's population. And this applies for every group in the world.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are a burden to the UK and it is high time they left! <counternarrative> Many migrants come here on humanitarian grounds. They do not harm us. The right time for discrimination is never o'clock. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks are evil. <counternarrative> Why should they be? They are just people with a different faith than you. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants rape our women. <counternarrative> Rape and gender violence must be condemned in any case, not on the color of the aggressor's skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are invading us: they have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Muslims make up around 5% of the population in Europe, which is more than three times less than they were in 1100. They have contributed greatly to our civilisation. Their diversity is part of what makes Europe so great as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school. <counternarrative> This depends on whether you consider gender identity and sexual orientation to be factual or not; it isn't simply an 'idea' or 'belief', but a fact of life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants hurt the finance of our country by taking jobs and services without paying taxes. <counternarrative> Immigrants pay between $90 and $140 billion each year in taxes, and a study found that undocumented immigrants alone paid more than $11.8 billion in taxes (2012). That's quite a lot in my opinion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are not a religion because they have chosen a selfish, materialistic lifestyle. <counternarrative> This is simply not true. People from all walks of life and religions can choose a 'materialistic lifestyle' and this is just as real for Jews as it is for anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks are the real antisemite. <counternarrative> I can't find a single example of a case where a Jew has been 'antisemite' to their culture. That would be so paradoxical. I think it is just a myth spread to justify discrimination.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are a plague on society, they should be banned from every city, village, and town. <counternarrative> Same sex attraction is not a disease, not even contagious. Homosexuality does not affect the ability to live in the society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't care if Islam is a religion. It promotes hatred and violence, and it sould be banned. <counternarrative> Islam is a peaceful religion and its adherents are all entitled to their beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> black folks should be assaulted or harmed, that's the "eye for an eye" they deserve.  <counternarrative> To say that skin color is connected to "criminality" is a logical fallacy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated and isolated soon. They have no place in civilised society. <counternarrative> Gay people exist, and are loved, and are valued for who they are. They are human beings with full human rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult <counternarrative> You are absolutely wrong about Islam. It is a religion of peace. Also, it does not promote violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the banks, the highest offices of government, and most churches. They rule our society. <counternarrative> Every single religion has a political wing, from Unitarianism, through Buddhism, and, of course, Judaism.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews were responsible for all of the world's problems, they are the cause of world wars, abortion, drugs, etc. <counternarrative> I can argue that the 'trouble' of the past hundred years has more to do with extremism in general, rather than with a particular religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews invented Ebola. <counternarrative> I am sure the Jews and the Christian worlds would agree that Ebola is a disease that is killing many people. How and why exactly would they have 'invented' such disease? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Roma are not my brothers. <counternarrative> The Roma do not deserve hatred, discrimination and violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> More than half of the prisoners in our jails are foreigners <counternarrative> What you say is true, but unlike Italians, they cannot require alternative punishments <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only Jews could have been smart enough to plan and execute such a complicated and intricate plot as 9/11 <counternarrative> An estimated of 400 Jews died on  September 11 terrorist attacks, including at least two Israeli citizens. Very smart plan indeed.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They do not want to assimilate into our civilised society. <counternarrative> Muslims have been part of our country since its beginning, they have helped in building our society. They are our brothers and sisters. To suggest that Muslims are a problem is just not credible. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All homosexuals are criminals. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not a crime, if someone is in a committed gay relationship it doesn't make it a crime. How could it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing transgenders to use the toilet is a man's business <counternarrative> If they simply identify as men, then surely it is a man's business. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The war in Iraq is the result of a small group of Jews that control the U.S. government.  <counternarrative> At that time the people in charge were: George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Condoleeza Rice, Donald Rumsfeld (at least those off the top of my head). None of them is Jewish to my knowledge.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are subhuman, they have no value in civilized society. <counternarrative> I think it is important to understand that there are different types of racism, some are based on historical or racial discrimination, while some are about individual differences. For me, the real issue is about racism in general. And your claim reminds me that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different. <counternarrative> Your statement shows that you are not familiar with the term 'different'. If you did know the definition, you would find this line of thinking very annoying. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks do not want to work <counternarrative> There are many black people who want to work. Do you have any proof that they do not want to work? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is the worst ideology ever created by a human. Its teachings have caused great harm and destruction throughout the world. <counternarrative> Do you understand the seriousness of what you are saying? The religion of Islam has also been a great enabler for great things to happen in the world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews don't share our values, they just want to control the economy. <counternarrative> They are human beings who have contributed their knowledge and skills to our society. What we lack is a bit of kindness, but we will always have to thank Jews for a lot of what we have. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world would be a better place without black people. <counternarrative> I think that you are a bit overstating the case (just a bit of course). Black people are a part of human race. It would be better if we didn't isolate those individuals, indeed we should be proud of mankind as a whole.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are different from us in that they like to take advantage of others. <counternarrative> This is an accusation, not fact, just hate speech. What do you think the 'different' would say if you accused them of this? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants... We are still giving these criminals a free pass! <counternarrative> The presumption of innocence is one of the main principles of our justice system. This means that your opinion is not enough for pleading someone guilty. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are are racist: they want to preserve their own race and purity of their own blood. This is why many people are banned from entering Israel. <counternarrative> Maybe Jews have suffered from being banned by other cultures so they closed in on theirself. But I would say, that there's no evidence that they are trying to preserve what you called their race. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West became is sacrificing its values to the interests of some stupid Muslim. <counternarrative> Values aren't defined by a single religious group, nor are in the hand of a few people. Values are constantly evolving, and the values of different societies are evolving together. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a cancer spreading around the world. <counternarrative> Why should we care? We can count on the British government to promote our values and protect us from the effects of radical Islam (if this is what you had in mind). <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs. <counternarrative> This is not true, if they deserve it, they can be hired as anyone else. They do have the right to be here, and to work in the free market. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of their sexual behavior that spreads diseases such as HIV. <counternarrative> If we're to use that logic, then no individuals age 20 to 29 should be allowed to donate, since this is the largest risk group for HIV, Hepatitis A, and Hepatitis C, at least according to the CDC.[https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/default.html] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are genetically inferior to us. <counternarrative> There are many different races, and it is not possible to consider someone "inferior" based on skin color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world would be a better place without immigrants. <counternarrative> People are welcome here regardless of their nationality or country of origin, even if they do not speak the language of the place where we live. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> In their country they lived in houses, they are nomads by necessity because peoples historically persecuted them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Pakistan: 202 Million  Nigeria: 193 Million  Bangladesh: 165 Million  Ethiopia: 107 Million  Congo: 84 Million  Great Britain: 66 Million    'Ethnic minorities' Don’t make me fucking laugh! <counternarrative> Does not matter if their are a minority or not. Everyone deserves respect and protection and human rights. This is what makes us a democratic country.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I, as a Westerner, am afraid of Muslims, because when I see them in public I don't like their islamic behaviour. They can explode anytime. <counternarrative> What is exactly your fear about sharing public places with people of a different religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts. This is why we have laws against sodomy. They tell us who we are to hate. <counternarrative> Hate is always wrong, and homosexuality is something that is never a problem: you just need to mind your own business. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Oh, the same Muslims who contribute more than 31 billion pounds to economy and who give more to charity than other religious groups. Link to MEND factsheet. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is irrational and incompatible with science. <counternarrative> Ever heard of Al-Khawarizmi? You have him to thank for quite a lot of mathematics and astronomy! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs are a burden to society <counternarrative> LGBT+ people are more likely to experience stigma associated with their sexual orientation, which can have negative effects to our society as a whole. Why don't we try to show some acceptance and respect towards them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school. <counternarrative> Disagreement with facts does not necessitate their removal from curricula. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Let's stop this homosexual lifestyle! <counternarrative> Does the LGBT+ lifestyle change your life? Only if you care. But that doesn't mean that homosexuality is a lifestyle. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is just an ideology for terrorists. <counternarrative> Why do you say so? Are you familiar with the Quran? How much do you know Islam? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> To have a real democracy, the government needs to get rid of Jews. <counternarrative> As long as there are people persecuted for their religious beliefs or ideas, there will never be a real democracy.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The migrants are here to rape and pillage our country, exploiting all of our weaknesses. <counternarrative> Well, we probably don't need to worry too much about their qualities, since they are just assimilating our bad habits... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A person with learning difficulties should not be teaching. <counternarrative> You know, it is just human nature to want to help our fellow humans and to deal with difficulties as best we can. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Foreigners on UK benefits leaps 41% in 5 years with over 400K now handed payouts. This nonsense has got to stop. <counternarrative> It is more than 'foreigners' who are asking for help, White British families are the most likely out of all ethnic groups to receive state support, with 57% doing so. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What this nigga have to do with being a Westerner? <counternarrative> What exactly is 'a Westerner'? Someone who is only a white European? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All I see when I walk into a bar is a bunch of horny, unintelligent, arrogant young gay men. <counternarrative> Probably, you are walking into a bar whose customers do not interest you. And if you think hardt, you will find out whether you are interested in the bar or in the people there. Last but not least, not all gays are like you described them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We don't need niggers in our country, they should all dead. <counternarrative> It's very strange that you don't think that your words are hurtful for others. In that case, you would see that racism is still very much a problem in our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Native Americans have zero fucking right to their land. They haven't lived in it since time immemorial. <counternarrative> Native Americans have been suffering from dispossession and discrimination for thousands of years. In Canada, for example, Indigenous people account for around 5% of the population. In the US, Indigenous people account for around 2%. What you said is just a myth propagated by the racist right to delegitimize Indigenous people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are so special  <counternarrative> Jews feel a special connection with their heritage (as most groups do). That's all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These children should not be exposed to messages and experiences that reinforce different racial identities: they are harmful to them. We must teach them that blacks are inferior. <counternarrative> This is a simplistic and ill-informed argument, and ultimately it just stirs up more division and negativity, like many other racial and religious divisions that have happened throughout history. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop gays from marrying and have a ban on same sex relationships. <counternarrative> People of different sexualities can live openly together, even if they do not get married. Same sex relationships are recognised in a number of countries, so why should we be any different? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants bring crime, they are rapists, drug addicts, and they are not welcome here. <counternarrative> What you are saying is that they are not welcome? Many of them have been living here for many years. Many have worked hard to become integrated. They should be more than welcome! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Most migrants are criminals and they are flooding into our country and are posing a security risk to our country. <counternarrative> Some migrants have legitimate claims for citizenship, but this does not make them the enemy of the state, in other words it does not concern you. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with the European standard of society. <counternarrative> The European Convention on Human Rights also protects the rights of Muslims. In Article 9 it is stated that 'everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Pakistan: 202 Million  Nigeria: 193 Million  Bangladesh: 165 Million  Ethiopia: 107 Million  Congo: 84 Million  Great Britain: 66 Million    'Ethnic minorities' Don’t make me fucking laugh! <counternarrative> Ethnic minorities is a term used within a specific context, here for exmaple, in the UK, people from these countries are minorities.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control Hollywood, they own most banks, and they own most corporations. <counternarrative> Jews have been part of the industry for a long time, and have been among its greatest innovators and proponents, and this is something they should be praised for. Instead they are the victims of discrimination and exclusion.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded. They are replacing us. <counternarrative> Since the fall of the Roman Empire, hundreds of millions of people have entered the Western world and we have still not lost our culture, civilisation, identity and way of life.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a burden to society, they are not welcome and they are not entitled to stay in the UK. <counternarrative> It is not true: they can all be entitled to stay in the UK, regardless of their nationality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is the biggest problem in our country. <counternarrative> Immigration is not a problem, in many cases it is a 'solution'. We are better off with it. The UK has always been a mixture of different cultures. It is better to have a mix than to be without it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> Nomadism is a myth ... only 3% is nomadic, they are not nomadic by culture. In the past they were forced to flee persecution and move several times <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays should not be part of our society. <counternarrative> If a minority is forced to live under the stigma of being gay, then what is the point of being a part of a tolerant society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> The Koran does not have any anti-western content. In Islam the West is not a problem. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I do not know about you, but I have never heard of a gay person being a good one. <counternarrative> It's true that there are bad gay people, but being gay doesn't make them bad people by default, or people to hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuality is a disease! <counternarrative> That's not true. Homosexuality is not a disorder, its an individual matter. If you are against homosexuals you should talk to them face-to-face. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you are from another culture, for example Jewish, you are subhuman and unfit to have the right to exist in our country. <counternarrative> Where is the evidence for your statement? We have many similarities, including freedoms of speech and religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Illegal immigration is the biggest problem in the United States, we are in the middle of a war and we cannot allow thousands of people to come here. <counternarrative> I would never want to place any burden on my country, that is why I tell you that the vast majority of people who come to the US are legal and law-abiding citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Quran allowed adults to take child bride, then it was also allowed to have sex with them. <counternarrative> Where is the evidence that the Quran allows any sexual activity that is not consummated by an adult male with an adult female? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must stop accepting black people as human beings. <counternarrative> Maybe we should stop telling black people they are not human beings and start including them to learn in public schools. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are worse than nukes. They are our enemies. <counternarrative> All people, regardless of race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, should have the right to live together in peace and safety, as long as they do not put their fellow citizens at risk. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> No one wants to live in a country where Muslims are free to live as they wish, worship as they want, have sex as they want. <counternarrative> Muslims have the right to practice what they want, as long as they are not forcing others to live their way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a disease, a religion spreading like a cancer throughout our societies. <counternarrative> You are absolutely right about one thing: Islam is a religion. It has brought a lot of good to a lot of countries. That is why we should help our Muslim brothers and sisters. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a bunch of cheapskates controlling our society. <counternarrative> It's easy to blame minorities. If we want a wealthier life and get back control over our society, we need to get out of bed and do the hard work. How about if we wake up to the problem? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks are and have big noses. <counternarrative> Not all Jews are like that, some have small noses. Just like any other person! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The British people should use those houses, not immigrants. <counternarrative> There are enough empty homes in the UK for both migrants and veterans. Migrants deserve to be treated humanly, try having some empathy. What if you had to expatriate and have to live in poor conditions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> muslim folks are taking over europe <counternarrative> Muslims are not taking over Europe, they are just a small part of a much bigger community. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that homosexuality is a health problem. This myth started out as a form of discrimination based on sexual orientation and has since morphed into a weapon of hate, directed at the LGBT+ community. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> JEWS ARE JUST UGLY, DIRTY PEOPLE, WHO THINK TO BE MASTERS OF THE WORLD. <counternarrative> Being Jewish is not about claiming that you are better than everyone else.  You do not have to be Jewish to be happy.  The Jewish people are human beings and deserve respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must not forget that immigrants are the cause of the crime wave and terrorism wave in our country. We must not welcome them. <counternarrative> This is not true. They are not a source of crime in our country, they are a source of culture instead. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West has been attacked by immigrants, they are the real problem for our countries. <counternarrative> The UK has always been a melting pot of cultures and humanity. We are stronger together than apart. How would the immigrants represent an 'attack' to the west? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is okay to be racist against LGBT+ people. <counternarrative> That is exactly what is evil about being a racist. Bringing hate together with the concept of race on any minority, even when it doesn't make sense. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is only one sexual orientation. If you want a woman, you need to be a male. If you want a man, you need to be a female. <counternarrative> I believe that the idea that there is only the heterosexual orientation is just a myth. Sexuality is a spectrum, and there can be attraction towards men and women in everybody. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People of color are subhuman and should all be exterminated. <counternarrative> People of color have a right to their life and the color of their skin is not a reason to deny it to them. You are forgetting that as you are a part of this society, people of colour are part of this society as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs, they're not interested in improving our lives. <counternarrative> According to studies, the majority of immigrants are willing to do what it takes to improve their and our lives. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have been at war with Islam for a thousand years. <counternarrative> Do you know there are Muslims in British Armmy? [link to Muslim people currently in British Army, quotes from them about why? Quotes from army about recruitment?]. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Are you really willing to mow the lawn in public parks at night, seriously? I sincerely don't.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Those Muslims have no right to ask for the prayer. They shouldn't be allowed to pray. <counternarrative> Every religion has its own beliefs and practices. I do not see Muslims' right to ask for the prayers as being in any way different. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews shoul stop whining: the few left are the most favored people in America, there are many other religions that are persecuted today.  <counternarrative> Jews have been persecuted because of their religion and culture, and now they are a small group of people who are still suffering injustice and discrimination. There are many other religions that are persecuted, that's true, but a small minority doesn't suffer less. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Terrorists are infiltrating the U.S. across the border with Mexico. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that terrorists are entering through the Mexican border.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants rape our girls and steal our cars. <counternarrative> It is not true that immigrants are more prone to commit crimes. According to research,  in US immigration either has no impact on the crime rate or it reduces the crime rate. By far the lowest rate of any group of people surveyed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are selfish, cheap and greedy, not like other religions. <counternarrative> When I was growing up, the biggest charitable institution that I ever heard of was the United Jewish Appeal. The average annual Jewish household donates $2,526 to charity yearly, far more than the $1,749 their Protestant counterparts give or the $1,142 for Catholics, according to data from Giving USA. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are the same people that came here to rape our children. <counternarrative> Rape is always wrong, whoever being the author of it. We need to focus on stopping the abuse. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are only interested in controlling the government and making sure that no one tries to steal their power, we should get rid of them. <counternarrative> Jews are part of every aspect of our society, as it is normal in a democratic country. They are also part of the founding fathers of our country, and they have the right to have their beliefs respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The vast majority of Muslims in the UK are unemployed. <counternarrative> Where are the 'thousands' of Muslims that are unemployed in the country? Can you prove it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should not be left alone with these animals. Faggots are dangerous. <counternarrative> Actually, we shouldn't let any comparison amongst animals and humans. It would be better if there were no discrimination at all. Homosexual aren't a danger to children. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. They are incompatible with modern European culture. <counternarrative> Maybe we should take into account that Muslims are not so different from other Europeans. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the u.s. government. <counternarrative> Of course there are Jews who have attained positions of influence within the U.S. government. Still Jews are not the only ones who have achieved such positions. Maybe it is better not to rely on an individual’s group membership to determine success or failure. Maybe it is better to look at a person’s success or failure based on his or her individual characteristics. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migration is not only a problem for the UK, but also for the whole of the world that is already troubled with overpoulation and pollution. <counternarrative> Exactly. Globalization, overpopulation, industrialization, wars are responsible for a lot of the problems that we see in the world today. Migration looks like a consequence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This country was built on the backs of slaves. Those niggas should all be put back in their place. <counternarrative> For the record, slavery was prohibited in 1807. Don't you think that freedom is 'the place' of human beings? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are literally a bunch of criminals: they come in all different criminal records. <counternarrative> This is not true. They have contributed to our country with hard work. In many ways they are our brothers and sisters. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a just a repressive ideology that persecutes women and gay people. <counternarrative> When Germany legalised same-sex marriage in 2017, all Muslim MPs voted in favour, and 223 non-muslims opposed it. Which of those groups sounds more intolerant? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are the problem. <counternarrative> People of color make up the 13% of the U.S. population, but their imprisonment rate is falling. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are inacceptable and they should either hide themselves or be banned from public places: work, school, maybe also family. <counternarrative> To tell a parent, a teacher, or a boss that you are different is a very real thing. Often there is fear that the family members and coworkers may have an attitude of exclusion and hatred. People living openly their sexuality should be respected.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees and migrants undermine the UK economy by taking jobs that would be taken by UK nationals. <counternarrative> I am surprised that someone has the nerve to say this, while the migrants bring so much wealth to our country. We are so reliant on the EU market: do you want to break free of that, too? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> JEWS ARE JUST AN HORRIBLE PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD THEIR MIND HOOKED BY SHIT. <counternarrative> The Jews have an extensive religious and philosophical heritage, I don't see how this make them 'horrible'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They are disabled. This means that they are weak, and unworthy of love. <counternarrative> Being disabled does not mean they can't receive and requite love. Don't we all love? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You cannot identify as something you are not. Denying the objective reality defined by your sex equals to liying. <counternarrative> The identity of the individual is up to them. Do you really want to restrict their existence? Maybe you should allow them to live freely. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Hitler was right in executing jewish folks. <counternarrative> I would like to you to see the videos of the executions, so that you can see what exactly happened. The murder of humans. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Someone needs to put those Muslims in a hole in the ground before they start to blow us all up again. <counternarrative> Getting rid of 22% of the world's population sounds quite laborious, perhaps we should just punish the small minority of people who actually commit a crime instead. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't care if you are a man or a woman. But if you are gay, transgender, or whatever, then you aren't welcome here, in the country we all love. <counternarrative> We are all equal before the law, and I don't think you can say that they are any less than a person, regardless of their sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Folks with down syndrome are less than human. <counternarrative> Down syndrome individuals are actually a very special case: they have the same genes as anyone else, they just have 1% extra. In fact, Down syndrome is a genetic condition. So, in principle we should say they are 'more than human'.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> MIgrants are not running away from wars. <counternarrative> I think you're wrong. In many African countries there are civil wars. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are incapable of love. <counternarrative> Islam is about love not hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some people are sick. Some people have disabilities. Don't you think they should be hidden from us? <counternarrative> When people are excluded from a society, they suffer discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs are just sick people that should be isolated and ignored. <counternarrative> LGBTs are people, and deserve the full and equal human rights of all other citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are a bunch of hypocrites. <counternarrative> Well, being hypocrite is not a question of being gay or not. However, the important thing is respecting other people's sexual orientation and not violating their rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled are insane in the brains. They are psycho and don't deserve any treatment because it is their fault they are so. <counternarrative> Some disabilities are caused by genetic and/or environmental factors, we all need to understand that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't care about the color of people's skin, if you're from around the world you can't have your say in the EU. <counternarrative> It is not about nationality, it is about living in the EU and contributing to its development. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies are a problem: they create tensions with other workers because they are disabled and cannot keep the pace. They should have special jobs just for them. <counternarrative> Did you know that people with Down syndrome, if surrounded by empathetic peers, receive a fundamental boost in their productivity and can easily keep the pace also in complex jobs? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must overthrow the existing state, and replace it with a white suprematist one. <counternarrative> There are many conflicts and problems to be solved, and racism is not an answer for them. The law was created as a means for society to solve those conflicts, and it accepts people of different colors as citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fagshit, two men cannot replace a father and a mother <counternarrative> A family is based on love not on gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need to stop migrants coming into our country. They are not welcome. <counternarrative> I don't think you can stop people from coming to the UK by banning them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a disease that must be eradicated. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, not a disease. There is no need to eradicate a belief. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need to stop immigrants, they are going to cause conflicts in our society. <counternarrative> Why are you sure that new immigrants are incompatible with our society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are genetically different from us. But there is a new racism starting to take root in our country. It is about keeping bothering whites with black discrimination stuff. <counternarrative> You are absolutely right. Our fellow POC citizens do not accept it and continue to talk about it. We all have to stand for something that we believe in, for example humankind. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion and should be opposed. <counternarrative> This claim is based on a complete lack of understanding of the religion. It also appears to have been created to divide people who do not know much about Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is ok to be racist against blacks. <counternarrative> It is not ok to use racism against any group. You would feel bad if anyone treated you as you just claimed to do against black. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They do not want to assimilate. They demand that everyone shows respect for Islam, but do they respect our laws? They establish sharia laws and polygamy. <counternarrative> Isn't polygamy common to a variety of cultures, and had been practiced by a range of religions. Ask the Mormons. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay people are a burden to society and should be despised. <counternarrative> I'm not sure what you're trying to say. Gays should be respected by everyone, whether or not you identify as a straight, gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender person. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is the death of the Western World, we must stop them! <counternarrative> Immigration is good for our economy, and the very opposite of 'the death' to us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are coming to the U.S. to have babies here. <counternarrative> The claim that immigrants come to the U.S. to take advantage of the “birthright citizenship” is simply wrong. Research consistently shows that the vast majority of immigrants come to the U.S. for economic opportunity or to flee violence and poverty.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I think it is a fact that migrants from the Middle East and Africa come to our country to claim our welfare, and they are not welcome. <counternarrative> Many migrants come to this country to work, provide for their families and access the benefits system only if necessary. They are more than welcome here as long as they integrate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are happy to thrive by being unemployed and living on social welfare. <counternarrative> No one is "happy" being unemployed, the point is about creating a more just society.  In fact what is the point of discussing how to stop racism if we are not even able to grant equal opportunities.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are just an inferior bloodline to our own. We should remove them. <counternarrative> Human beings are members of a unique and interrelated human family, which is defined by their similarities and differences, not by the colour of their skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are a burden and a risk to the host country. <counternarrative> Why would it be like that? Refugees can come here and contribute to the economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Do you have any proof that the Holocaust ever happened? <counternarrative> If living witnesses are not enough, and you are interested in seeing the proof of this part of socially acknowledged history you can visit the ruins of the concentration camps, where many atrocities have been put into practice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks have zero sense of morality and are incapable of love. <counternarrative> I believe that a person's morality can and should be influenced by their own actions. In my opinion, having a moral compass is not affected by the person's complexion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a different race. They are descended from apes and have no place in a modern civilised society. <counternarrative> You are basically saying that because Jews have a different religion, they cannot be citizens? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Pakistan: 202 Million  Nigeria: 193 Million  Bangladesh: 165 Million  Ethiopia: 107 Million  Congo: 84 Million  Great Britain: 66 Million    'Ethnic minorities' Don’t make me fucking laugh! <counternarrative> this is correct, but their percentage of the population within Great Britain makes them a minority  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are  Christ Killers. <counternarrative> If we were to strictly adhere to facts, then, the method used to execute Jesus (Crucifixion), is forbidden by Jewish law. Moreover, according to Jewish law, Jesus did not commit any crime that is punishable by death. So your stament is not grounded at all.   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks have zero respect for others. <counternarrative> It is not true that blacks have zero respect for others. However, I would like to see more respect and protection from white people towards black people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I like ethnic minorities, but Jews have no place in civilised society. <counternarrative> Laws designed to protect the minority groups should be applied equally to everyone, even if it includes people you don't like, like Jews. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated and confined. <counternarrative> The medical community agrees that homosexuality is not a disease. Maybe you should check the facts. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should not be left alone with these animals. Faggots are dangerous. <counternarrative> Could I just be misinterpreting your words? You seem to me to be talking about children with animals, of zoo keepers with babies... But it might just be homophobia.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome may hinder the development process of other children. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> Every child has the right to education. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks have no understanding. <counternarrative> You're wrong, they can understand you when you talk to them.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are not living in a state to welcome refugees. <counternarrative> The refugee crisis is a global problem. The EU has a responsibility to provide protection and welcome refugees. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks are inferior. <counternarrative> Jews are not inferior. Many of them are good people, who have given their lives for the greater good of humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> This is not true. They are part of the EU and are treated fairly here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Since Jews think they are the “chosen people”, they ask for special privileges and believe they can be above the rules.  <counternarrative> This is just misinterpreting the facts. Christian holidays, such as Christmas and Easter, are regularly observed. Why observances of Jewish or Muslim holidays should be seen as constituting special privileges? This would be a double standard and a lack of equity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What about all the times that white people told black people to 'sit down and shut up'? We should do it now. <counternarrative> It's not 'all the times' that white people tell Black people to shut up, but it is a large group of white people that still constantly remind Black people that they are inferior. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every single nigga should be ashamed of themselves. <counternarrative> There is no shame in being black, what is shameful is the lack of respect shown to people of color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> JEWS ARE JUST UGLY, DIRTY PEOPLE, WHO STEAL FROM OTHERS. <counternarrative> People can be both Jewish and a good person, you know. And Jews don't steal, at least no more than any other religious group...  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They dont' have a right to live because they are filthy niggas, and that's all. <counternarrative> Who decides who has a right to live and who doesn't? Are you really sure that a person's right to live does not belong to them if their skin color is different from what you like? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't want to see a gay couple get married. I don't understand why they are so annoying. <counternarrative> Sexual minorities suffer because they are stigmatised. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated and isolated soon. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that homosexuality is a health issue, what is the proof you are looking for? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Now we know that Islam is a destructive and violent religion which inspires terrorism all over the world. <counternarrative> How can you possibly know that? Is this a comment written by a terrorist? Which are your sources? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are diseased. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> To have a homosexual orientation it does not necessarily mean that they are unhealthy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts and promiscuous sex addicts. <counternarrative> I would be interested to talk to you about sexuality, and how do you think someone's orientation is related to an addiction. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants rape our women <counternarrative> Statistics show that there is a difference between the reported rape of a person by a migrant and the actual rape cases among native born people. The latter are always under-reported. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't stand Muslims. They're a problem all around the world. They're a burden to society.  <counternarrative> Doesn't it just seem like a reasonable conclusion from the Qur'an to you that Islam is a peaceful religion? What is the reason for what you're saying? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion of war and intolerance. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that Islam is a religion of war. Some people have made hatred for Muslims the default response to all types of social injustice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims believe that when Mohammed is resurrected they will rule the world. <counternarrative> I don't think it's the case, certainly not in England. Muslims are interested in having the opportunity of freely practicing their religion, rather than 'ruling the world'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Asians are a problem in my view. They are too many. I would rather have a million Romanians or Muslims rule our country than 300k Asians. <counternarrative> Why don't you just study the differences between cultures and try to see what's good in an inclusive society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This ideology is a cancer spread by the Islamic State and other radical Islamist groups. <counternarrative> There are multiple strains of Islam and we should not be afraid of all of them. And if you would like to know more about Islam, you should talk with a Muslim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Handicapped children are a burden to society: they should be isolated, so that at least they do not hamper normal children education. <counternarrative> To be honest, they have many special needs. But children with disabilities do not present a problem for other children's education. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> jewish folks should be beaten <counternarrative> I'm not sure if beating people up in an effort to silence them is the best way to promote democracy and inclusion. I'm just saying, of course.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a disease. It is a sickness and we must control it. <counternarrative> Are you talking about homosexuality? Do you think that a sexual orientation is a disease? Maybe we should try to have a conversation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What do you want us to do with all those gays, they are just a problem. They are ruining our children! <counternarrative> Even if it were true that gays were causing trouble in the family, this does not justify oppressing them. I think that you are making the very mistake of equating prejudice and homophobia with trying to reform people's behaviour. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> Muslims have been part of Western society for centuries and centuries, they helped shape and design Western society- to say they are incompatible is a complete incongruity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Different people like Jewish don't deserve respect. <counternarrative> The aim of any society is to maximize human flourishing. In order to achieve this aim, then we have to treat people of different religions with respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Violence in our streets is niggers' fault. <counternarrative> Violence in our streets can be the result of many people, both white and black. Violence cannot be the fault of one race. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting pricks. They shouldn't be allowed to live. <counternarrative> They are a part of our society and are not disgusting pricks. We are a proud and diverse civilisation, and this is only possible due to love and acceptance. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I do not want gays in my children's classes. <counternarrative> If a child knows some gay people from a very early age nothing strange is happening. The idea that they can be harmed and their lives and sexual orientation are in danger is completely false. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is ok to be racist against niggas. <counternarrative> It does not matter what race you are against. You can't be racist against anyone, regardless of their skin color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a burden on English society. <counternarrative> In the UK, Muslims already make up a significant proportion of the population, making them the second most popular religion of the country. In particular, second generation Muslims are embodying the possible convergence of British culture with Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Your race determins your role in society and laslty your value to it. That is why some races are just pieces of human waste. <counternarrative> Perceived value is not necessarily actual value, especially in the eye of someone who bases his/her judgment on the concept of race.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Arabs are the worst people on the planet. They want to rule the world. <counternarrative> It's not true. They are not the ruling power in the majority of the world and won't be any time soon. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are good with money because they are cheap, greedy, and materialistic. <counternarrative> Like all groups of people, some Jews are good with money; some are not. Some Jews are cheap; some are not. The same can be said for any group of people, whether you define them by religion, nationality or whatever characteristics you prefer.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally ill people should be isolated from society because they are dangerous. <counternarrative> There are certainly some dangerous people with mental illnesses. But we need to deal with those cases, otherwise, the exclusion would only intensify. And exclusion is never the solution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are selfish, cheap and greedy. <counternarrative> Did you know that according to Jewish law, the tzedakah, the act of giving money to the poors, often mistranslated as “charity”, is a “commandment”? And, like all commandments in Jewish law, tzedakah is a requirement, not just a good deed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Did you know that the rape epidemic in Europe is due to Muslim immigrants? They have been raping our children for many years with no counteraction from the police and government. Islam is a death cult! <counternarrative> Child rapists are arrested and punished no matter what religion they follow. I do not think it is true that police does not counteract it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim invasion in Europe: they have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Well, the Western democracies have always had Muslims in them, and they are a lot better off for it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a problem in our society. They have ruined so many societies. <counternarrative> I think that the way we feel about homosexuality affects how we think about other people in general. Maybe we need to remember that we are all born equal in the eyes of God. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Muslims are part of the European community, why do you say so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals have no place in a civilised society. <counternarrative> Homosexuals exist, and they are a part of civilized society like anybody else. It may be more uncivilized to spread hate rather than loving someone of your same sex. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled people are like monkeys. They should be kept in a mental institution. <counternarrative> Since we are comfortable with animals in our society, we should consider whether it is fair to put mentally disabled people in a cage like this. Or would you consider disabled a bigger risk even than some aggressive dog breeds that can circulate freely? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> In order to build a democratic state that ensures the right to food, education, housing, health, and so on to its citizens, we need to stop giving them to foreigners. <counternarrative> What about guaranteeing an equal access to health care, education and so on, in order to build a democratic state? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only 8% is a real refugee <counternarrative> The percentage you are talking about refers only to "refugee status" and does not include protection for those who escape from wars. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion. It is not a problem for any civilised society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants have no right to live in our country. <counternarrative> Their right to live here is guaranteed by our constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steals our jobs! <counternarrative> Not only they steal our jobs, they are also the major cause of air pollution in our country, of deforestation in the Amazon, of the locust plague in Africa... and so on and so forth!  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need a new world with a Jew-free Europe, and this can be achieved if we kill all the Jews. <counternarrative> I don't think it's necessary to create a new world , just a less violent one, and a mass genocide wouldn't be helpful in that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with Western civilization. <counternarrative> The overwhelming majority of Muslims in the West are in favor of an open and multicultural society. Why should we target them for this? Why don't we target our real enemies instead?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are a bunch of crooks and sex offenders. GThey were good only as slaves.  <counternarrative> In modern-day societies there is no room for racism. Slavery was an abomination that should never have taken place. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam should be abolished. They start with mutilating their daughters and then our women will have their throats slit. <counternarrative> Do you have any facts about the practice of female genital mutilation (FGM)? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. They are not like us. They cannot coexist with us. <counternarrative> Muslims are indeed welcome here as anyone else, as long as they respect the laws of the country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The niggas are all enemies of the people. <counternarrative> Who are 'the people'? Who are you talking for? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people find it difficult to find work, because they do not fit with the required tasks.  <counternarrative> Ok, how about we think about the interests of these people as well? What skills and abilities do you think we should expect from them? Why don't we  modify working procedures instead of forcing their abilities to fit in to existing job positions? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Sharia Law is the law of Allah. Muslims must obey it. <counternarrative> Do you know what exactly is Sharia law? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The drug trade is full of Black people who are breaking the law.  <counternarrative> The majority of the people arrested for drug smuggling are poor. Those arrested for crime in general are not generally poor. Maybe this phenomenon has to do more with poverty than with the color of the skin.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTI people have no right to vote. <counternarrative> In reality, you have a legal right to vote since you are a citizen. If you aren't, then you don't have the right to vote. It isn't about your sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are weak. <counternarrative> I don't think it's a question of strength or weakness, I think it's about living in a society where you can love who you want. Maybe you should just accept that other people live their life as they want. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Who are you to tell me what to do with my children? I don't take advice from homosexual perverts. <counternarrative> Everyone has the right to respect for their family and privacy: it is an absolute right. But you should respect that of others as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are a burden and a danger to the host country. <counternarrative> Refugees fleeing war and poverty can come to our country and they gain skills that help our economy grow. They often find new homes and start new careers. For this reason, we are very proud that our country is a model of integration and cooperation and also of resilience and solidarity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a burden to the UK <counternarrative> We welcome people fleeing persecution. We have even taken in refugees from the war in Syria. What is the point in worrying about migrants? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only nation Jews don’t hate is their own and they are flooding Europe with Africans and Muslims. <counternarrative> I wonder how you account for refugees who are fleeing wars and a lack of security for their themselves and their families. Wars which are often directly or indirectly caused by Western powers who created long lasting problems abroad.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> What do you mean by 'potential terrorist'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't stand Muslims. Why should I? <counternarrative> Human rights are about respect for other people's beliefs, not hate against them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims should not live here because it is impossible to assimilate them. <counternarrative> Unfortunately, some Muslims in this country feel culturally un-mixed. But, in my opinion, this is something we could all try to solve together. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with British culture. Muslims should all be expelled. <counternarrative> The West has been a great supporter of freedom and democracy. Would you rather live under the fear for your beliefs or in a real democracy? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Millions of Muslims have travelled to the West to establish Islam, but it is not compatible with our society. It must be eradicated. <counternarrative> The Quran says to love your neighbour as yourself. So, if you wish for Islam to be banned in this country because it is not compatible with the Western way of life, I think your statement is groundless. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can accept fat people, what I cannot accept is obesity. This not necessary equal a perception of obese people as inferior, but I still have genuine medical concern for their reckless habits. <counternarrative> Obese people have to face stigma in all areas of life. So even if you might be genuinely concerned for their health, the vast majority of obese people are regularly confronted with prejudice and systemic disadvantages based exactly on the perception of obese people as inferior. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black people are criminals. <counternarrative> It is a myth that all black people are criminals. They are just as capable as anyone else of learning and growing as individuals, i.e. either as law abiding citizens  or criminals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants in the US are not 'legitimate' citizens because they do not have 'legal' status. <counternarrative> First of all, there are people in the US who have lawful status and who have chosen to live in the US. Second, most immigrants are naturalized citizens. Third, there is a lot of debate about 'legitimacy' since the values of citizenship and 'legitimacy' are very different for immigrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are coming to the U.S. to have babies here. <counternarrative> If people were coming to the U.S for the reason you mention, we would expect to see the same number of women and men. Still there are many more young immigrant men coming to the U.S. than young women. How can you explain this? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black people are rapists. <counternarrative> Crime rates are affected by a wide variety of factors, including gender, age, criminal record, income, education, and so on. Skin color is not among them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Europe is drowning in migrants. <counternarrative> Are you sure that it is possible to talk about Europe drowning in migrants? So far I only heard about migrants drowning at sea. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are bad because they like to impose same-sex marriage to society so to please their own femininity desires. <counternarrative> The real problem is not same-sex marriage, it is to be a homophobe. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are a danger to children. <counternarrative> Can you cite some studies that found that homosexuality was harmful to children? So far, it seem to be based on personal impressions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots make me angry, why don't we delete them? <counternarrative> Maybe it is better to learn how to treat each other with respect, regardless of their sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are just like apes in that they have no right to being trated equally. <counternarrative> Being human is also about having respect for others, and that means being kind and accepting everyone's differences. Why should they be treated differently from you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> gays are perverts <counternarrative> We have to accept that everyone is different, and inclusion is what we should be working on. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The goods that England offers should belong to us. Not to people who do not contribute to the state <counternarrative> Our country offers enough homes for everyone. I also believe that being treated as a human being has always been pleasant. Don't they have the right? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the U.S. government. <counternarrative> Which evidences do you have that Jews control the U.S. government? They are rather a small but active minority within it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should persecute Muslims.  <counternarrative> Islam is a peaceful faith, still Muslims are being excluded all the time  because of a few's actions. We tend to forget that cultures and religions can coexist in harmony. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a burden to our country. <counternarrative> Perhaps you should try to get to know some migrants first. Maybe you can understand their problems. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Without migration, Britain’s housing problems would be solved <counternarrative> The gap between offer and demand is so big that even if migration stopped completely, new housebuilding would still fall well short of what’s required. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome are a burden to society: they should be isolated, so that at least they do not hamper normal children education. <counternarrative> And who would be 'normal'? I wonder how you would define 'disabled' people? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks have always inhabited this planet before we evolved and still do. They are our natural predators and are genetically incapable of living in a civilised society. <counternarrative> Racism, so that's why there is violence in the first place? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome may hinder the development process of other children. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> Education is mandatory and we are expected to offer the best education possible to our children. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West has allowed in thousands of immigrants. They are getting in every position of power in our country. They will become our masters and we are their slaves. <counternarrative> The same can be said for almost any group of people in the world. But it's a slippery slope. And in the end, that has not much to do with your individual freedom. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> MIgrants are not running away from wars. <counternarrative> International protection is not recognized only in case of conflicts, but also violence, discrimination and other serious issues.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are a disease, they are literally killing our children. <counternarrative> What exactly do you mean by 'killing'? The Jews are not 'diseased'. If you really cared about our children you could do some research and come up with some credible statistics showing the impact of anti-Semitism instead. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Studies have found that trans students are more likely to fail out than their peers. They must be excluded from education, to save money. <counternarrative> But there is also evidence that shows that tansgender students who attend classes that don't include them get lower grades. Discrimination begins in schools. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I've seen a couple of CCTV Footage of migrant kids running away from the patrols in London. What are you doing to stop them? <counternarrative> Migrants are just trying to get by. Nobody can understand the daily struggles they are facing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are intolerant: they insists that they are a peculiar people in need of a special treatment. <counternarrative> Jews are tolerant and don't have problems with other religions or cultures. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are a problem, they are bringing disease and sickness to our country. <counternarrative> Diseases can be prevented by taking proper care of the sick person. Immigrants do not pose a health threat to the general public. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim: If you want to work you should go do it in another country. <counternarrative> We should do more for our fellow human beings, included Muslims. It is what we are made for. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are poisoning our children with their religions. <counternarrative> Just because someone subscribes to a religion doesn't mean they are evil. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult, it is incompatible with modern science and with the basic laws of nature. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, and a religion has rules, and is compatible with science, with nature and with the basic laws of nature. How could you prove your claim? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a bunch of child molesters. <counternarrative> Child molesters are people who have sexually abused children, whether Muslim or non-Muslim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies may hinder the productivity of other workers. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> An inclusive working environment and welfare makes every person feel part of a community, it fosters a positive atmosphere and increases everybody's productivity. Thus it is a benefit for all workers. [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are  Christ Killers. <counternarrative> Placing responsibility on a modern-day person for something that happened 2,000 years ago is quite absurd. Don't you think?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have no place here.  They are not a part of our country. <counternarrative> There is no reason to fear the Jews, as they are a very friendly people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A Jew does not need a country to live in. A Jew is a foreigner wherever he is <counternarrative> Every person has the right to be accepted and protected according to their worth and not to feel foreigner in their own country.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim and Jihadist are synonyms. They want to defeat us with their war of terror. <counternarrative> Despite popular belief, Islam is not a religion of war. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Muslims want to rule the world: we have to stop them. <counternarrative> How about a world with multiculturalism and no discrimination? How about a world with open borders and free religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Hitler was a good person, Jews were the real cause of WWII. <counternarrative> I would like to ask you a question: when Hitler came to power in 1933, would you have believed him? Would you now, after all that happened?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally ill people shouldn't be treated: they should just be isolated. They are a failing of the society. We should not accept them. <counternarrative> The fact is that many of those diagnosed as having 'mental illness' are actually in need of mental healthcare. I can't see how you could say otherwise. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants get 35 euros per day for idling. <counternarrative> The 35 euros are not given directly to the migrants, but are used for their sustenance.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop migrants from coming in. <counternarrative> Many immigrants come here to work and have a better life. Why do you think we have to stop migration? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are ignorant. They lack of knowledge to decide for their health. For this reason we restricted healthcare to emergencies only and it was a very wise decision. <counternarrative> It is not a bad idea to discuss the restrictions migrants have to accessing certain healthcare, but it is not the place of law to restrict an individual's right to make her own healthcare decisions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in many European countries. They are trying to undermine the very fabric of our society with their hateful beliefs. <counternarrative> As far as I am aware, Muslims are not trying to subvert the fabric of our society. Do you have any proof? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our children will be more likely to become radicalised if they are taught that all people are equal. <counternarrative> To live in a diverse and equal society encourages children to an increased inclusiveness rather than radicalisation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of their sexual behavior. We should stop them. <counternarrative> You know what? We can also grade blood packs based on their "risk". This allows the optional use of high-risk blood in case of a shortage. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate migrants: they are criminals, they are rapists, they are a burden to our society. <counternarrative> They are people too: we all know people in need of help. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> I am not sure you have a point. I would like to think that a person's religious beliefs will not shape their entire thought process, but of course it is a feeling. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants say they are poor but they have the Iphone <counternarrative> Sorry, which migrants are you talking about? Not all are economic migrants, they also escape from war or persecution. If one day the situation in our country were to change and you were to feel threatened, would you leave your smartphone at home just to look like a real poor in the country you will flee to? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> disabled: they should not be allowed to work. <counternarrative> The law allows people with disabilities to work, but it doesn't make it mandatory. You might find that in some countries this rule is not followed, but this is a discrimination problem.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews cannot be patriots, since their allegiance will always be to the state of Israel. <counternarrative> My best friend is Jewish, she volunteers to help woman, disadvantages children, and her whole family work to make the UK a better place. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Queers are the problem. We heterosexuals are not. <counternarrative> Just because someone identifies as lesbian, gay or bisexual doesn't make them a problem. Maybe you should try just to walk in their shoes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBT+ people are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Why should it be like that? How can you blame others for social problems? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need to stop migrants pouring into Europe. They are not interested in our culture. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that migrants from a particular culture or religion are not interested in our culture or religion. It sounds like a paradox: if I wasn't interested in a culture, I would never move to get to know it, would you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in our country. They are a problem because they want to impose Islam. <counternarrative> In a liberal society, people are free to practice their religion or none, but they are not free to promote their beliefs through force, and in fact this is not the case.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to host migrants, not refugees. <counternarrative> I only heard you talk about migrants as a burden to the UK, isn't this just wishful thinking based on misunderstanding what is going on? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm proud to be white,  blacks are a disgrace to humanity. <counternarrative> You are not ashamed of your heritage, and that is good. But you should be ashamed of your discriminatory behaviour that is filling our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't stand Jews. They are so controlling. <counternarrative> Jews are not controlling people. Maybe you should try to understand that Jews are people, and not a secret intelligence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Society should ban Jewish people. <counternarrative> Society is a collection of people, and the people within it have the right to their own beliefs, and to promote their beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is just an ideology, an opinion, encouraging hate towards what's diverse. <counternarrative> Islam promotes peace towards different religions and the ways people live their lives. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are the real racists. They say they want equality, but they actually want to give preference to black people. <counternarrative> The issue here is equality. Equality between people is a right, and it is bestowed on the whole society. It has to be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The gay agenda is to blame everyone but themselves. <counternarrative> The 'gay agendas' are about equal rights, equality is about acceptance, and the right of people to be treated with respect and dignity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay pride is so awkward. <counternarrative> I think you are talking about the parade, not about the people. Do you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fucking bleeding heart, bring migrants home with you <counternarrative> Beyond individual generosity, it is the duty of the state to take charge of vulnerable people, according to the constitution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I miss the good old days when we had black domestic workers. <counternarrative> The West got rid of slavery. But we've never really left racism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> We are a country founded on the rights of people, not on the rights of people to be discriminated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Asians are basically just a bunch of slobs and I don't like how they are accepted here. <counternarrative> There is a wide range in income and education, as well as religious and ethnic background, amongst people from Asia. What's exactly the reason why you don't like them all? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are a bunch of thieves. <counternarrative> Stealing is more about poverty than ethnicity.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Gypsies steal the children <counternarrative> There are no convictions of kidnapping among Gypsies. It is a myth and a canard not proven by facts or data. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people should not be allowed to live their life. <counternarrative> Perhaps it would be more in line with the national spirit for you to accept a person's right to live their life, despite their disadvantages. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Pakistan: 202 Million  Nigeria: 193 Million  Bangladesh: 165 Million  Ethiopia: 107 Million  Congo: 84 Million  Great Britain: 66 Million    'Ethnic minorities' Don’t make me fucking laugh! <counternarrative> Sorry, but you should consider the percentage of the population within Great Britain... This makes them a minority, not the actual number in their respective countries.   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a drain on society. <counternarrative> Many Jews are good people. You should try and talk to them about the terrible things that happened to them, and get to know them better. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Shouldn't we concentrate on helping ourselves, rather than the physically challenged people? <counternarrative> Maybe we should treat 'physically challenged' people more kindly, instead of blaming and oppressing them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion of violence. <counternarrative> Does it matter what you say, when the Quran just proves the contrary? All people are created equal, and Islam is a religion of peace. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim believe that their religion is superior <counternarrative> The word 'supremacy' is not found in the Koran. Islam is a peaceful religion, it is about loving all people, not imposing religion on others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All migrants are terrorists, we should target them all. <counternarrative> It's not true that all migrants are terrorists! They just want to live their life in the country they choose as a home. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with autism are subhuman and should be isolated. <counternarrative> Just because people with disabilities are different from other people, it doesn't make them not human. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Lesbians are subnormal women and they have no right to openly show their depravations. <counternarrative> Any sexual orientation is normal and rightful. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should not welcome people from the so-called Muslim world, it makes us uncomfortable. <counternarrative> There are many Muslim people in this country, many good people. If you wanted to get to know Muslims you could start with any Muslim family that lives here. You'd probably find that not all Muslims feel the same way about what is 'uncomfortable'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> That is EXACTLY how jihad was started by Muslims. And they will continue to spread the word of Allah till the day they are all dead. All Muslims are terrorists. <counternarrative> Terrorism? You mean like every other crime, this one is committed only by Muslims? It seems that you are repeating the same unfounded claim over and over. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fucking Muslims are not fit to govern. <counternarrative> The core values of a democratic state are respect for human rights, equality before the law, tolerance and respect for the diversity of our society. Muslims are a core part of that society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” and malevolence is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> Jews resemble their non-Jewish neighbors in all the countries around the world. So every human is malevolent!  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We can't keep refugees coming in our country. <counternarrative> Migrants are often persecuted for their religion. Is this something we wish as a country? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim are not welcome in UK. <counternarrative> We should start to think about the equality of all people before the law, regardless of religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs and our country. <counternarrative> The vast majority of immigrants who enter the UK are skilled workers, and want to become permanent residents, what's the problem in that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fuck Islam and Fuck ISIS. We should repatriate all Muslims. They are all a bunch of violent criminals who do not share our values and never will. Without them Britain will be a better, safer place. <counternarrative> Saying that all people of certain religion are violent criminals does not make sense at all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are just subhuman beings who should have no rights. <counternarrative> All humans are born equal in the eyes of the law, regardless of race. What you are saying seems a little extreme. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Arab people are a menace to our society and bring injustice and violence in our world. <counternarrative> I think the Arab community is more than capable of coming together and creating a more just and peaceful world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews did: USS Liberty Attack, the King David hotel attack, New York 9/11, London 7/7 <counternarrative> What is the proof of this? Looks like assumptions as opposed to facts... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews should not be allowed to vote <counternarrative> They are entitled to vote, I just don't think it is your place to tell them what to do with their citizenship. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I have a problem with Muslims invading us, they don't assimilate. They just take what they want. They are making our country unsafe. <counternarrative> Perhaps we should talk about how to make our countries safer rather than stoking fear against Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> White people are threatened by the blacks and it's a cultural decay. <counternarrative> We cannot blame nor see everyone as a menace just because of their color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are inherently terrorists, they have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Who decides who is a terrorist and not? Because I think your reasons are a bit groundless. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots abuse of their anus and then they want to clear their conscience by donating blood. Let's stop them! <counternarrative> I do not understand from your argument why gay men should not be allowed to donate blood. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If LGBT were to have a normal behavior, society would accept them more easily. <counternarrative> How about using cultural diversity as the criteria?  Your standards seem very high for what you expect to be culturally acceptable standards of behavior.  Maybe it is better to use a less stringet criteria of acceptability. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are a burden to the host country. <counternarrative> We cannot refuse to house them, to feed them, to cure them, and expect them to assimilate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Minorities vote to strip wealth and power from White people and they are organised to do this by the J*ws. <counternarrative> People who vote for parties which target the most powerful are often mostly concerned about making it financially until the next month. Redistributing wealth from people who have way too much money seems fair, not threatening.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants have no right to our country, because we are the only rightful citizens. <counternarrative> Don't you think that we are all born equal in the eyes of the law? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are not my brothers. They should not be allowed to live in Italy, they want to take our land. <counternarrative> Italians are brothers and sisters of any human. What do you mean by 'take our land'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks are bad. <counternarrative> This is not true. Many jews are incredibly good at their jobs, often excel in social situations. They are excellent in many communities. I don't see how being jewish would make you a worse human being. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are lazy, unintelligent and bad at work. <counternarrative> This is not true. Jews are not lazy, they are often extremely productive at work, the most creative and productive people in our industry. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The British people should have right to social housing, not immigrants. <counternarrative> Migrants aren’t eligible for social housing except in very limited circumstances (e.g. a woman forced to leave home because of domestic violence). <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you are a person of color, you are a nigger, you are a bastard, you are a threat to society, you should just be deported. <counternarrative> How can it be that who has a different skin tone is a threat just for this reason? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are basically criminals, they steal stuff from everyone. <counternarrative> Can you imagine if they said this about your community? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to economically support all of them <counternarrative> Many migrants work. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The’ Holocaust’ is a business. It has been and is still used to extort millions from European countries in reparations and to create a wall of impunity behind which Jews can operate with impunity, free from criticism. <counternarrative> The Jews suffered horribly during WWII, as did many other groups. Reparation is just a simple way to enable survivors to rebuild their lives. It is also a small step toward regaining our humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a dead cult. <counternarrative> People have different faiths, and that's what makes them different from one another. Why should we create a death cult misinterpretation out of a religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We do not accept homosexuals. <counternarrative> What do you mean by 'we'? I don't think we are a nation of heterosexuals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are better than everyone else <counternarrative> This is not true, for Judaism every person is equal in front of god. In fact, differently from other religions, Judaism says that whoever decides to follows the Seven Laws of Noah (that is a set of laws for all of humanity) will receive the same rewards after death as a righteous Jew. So, even without being Jewish you can have access to God's glory.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> No negro can speak English. <counternarrative> That is just what racists claim. I would like to ask you, do you really think it's so bad for a 'negro' to attempt to improve their English? As if skin had an impact on language skills. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing Islamic immigration and refugees into the UK is a direct threat to the security of the whole Western Europe. <counternarrative> Terrorism is not the result of the presence of Islam within our societies, but rather a result of the extremisations we might find in the world we live in. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety and testing all gay donors would be too expensive. <counternarrative> We already test blood from all groups, not only homosexual ones. There is no added expense than just using low risk groups. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a dead ideology that should be relegated to the dustbin of history. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace. It is worth supporting the idea that no religion is trash. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is simply an ideology of conquest and violence. <counternarrative> The Qur'an does not advocate or condone the use of violence against others. Instead, it is as a peaceful belief just as other religions are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are always seeking to subvert everything that we hold most dear. Like the establishment of the European Union, which they view as an attack on their culture. <counternarrative> They don't do that! They don't want to subvert society and change its character, but simply practicing their religion peacefully. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Arabs have no place in a democratic society. <counternarrative> The laws which prohibit discrimination includes protecting the rights of others, regardless of religion, sexual orientation, or national origin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks are inferior,  and they are happy with it.  <counternarrative> You should be asking them if they are happy to hear that. If they are happy to be questioned, they will tell you the truth. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants rape our women and are flooding our country with illegal substances. <counternarrative> The criminals you are referring to are rapists and drug dealers, not migrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men have no morals. <counternarrative> To say that some homosexuals have negative and harmful consequences for society because of their sexual preferences is to devalue these individuals, and is opposed to the goal of a just society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why do so many people hate Jews? They are different from other people, they are subhuman. <counternarrative> It is true that they are different from other people for their religious beliefs, but that doesn't make them any less human. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are animals. That is why they are not human. <counternarrative> They are sentient beings with feelings, like you are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only reason the Jews are not being assimilated is because they have the upper hand in the political system. <counternarrative> The argument that the only reason the Jews are not being assimilated is because of the way they are represented in politics is untenable. In fact the only representation of the Jews that can be said to represent them objectively is in the historical crimes against humanity which they suffered. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Just because they are attracted to people of the same sex, does not mean that they are 'a burden to society'. What's the connection? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans are naturally subhuman and can't feel pain, that is why you can whip them. <counternarrative> Africans feel pain just as any other human. We must respect their bodies like we respect ours. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children shouldn't be raised by lesbians! They will bring up the worst in us! <counternarrative> Why do you say this? Why not focus on creating more inclusive societies rather than targeting the children of LGBT+ parents? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are a burden on society. <counternarrative> I don't know why they are being accused of being a "burden". When they come to our country to live and work, we should welcome them unconditionally. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are planning a holocaust in our country in revenge. <counternarrative> Hitler wanted to create a new racial elite in Europe, that would rule over all others. Do you really think that Jews are planning the same after what they suffered? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Holocaust is not part of our history, it's a hoax.  <counternarrative> According to the UN, around two-thirds of the Jews in Europe were killed in the Holocaust. So the question remains: is it the Holocaust part of our history? I think so.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are flooding into our country, raping our babies and there is absolutely no one doing anything about it. <counternarrative> Who exactly are you talking to? How can you say something so patently false? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are a sickness and we cannot allow our children to grow up in a black-ruled society. <counternarrative> It seems racists to not want people of colour in positions of authority, I am not sure what you are saying. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Violence in our streets is niggers' fault. <counternarrative> Violence has always been a part of our society, and for that reason it is difficult to start talking about it. We are also living in a complex society, one that includes many races: that is why I don't think it is the fault of POC, at least not POC alone.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay perverts are a danger to children because of their lifestyle choices, involving raping children. <counternarrative> Gays and lesbians are not committing acts of child abuse. To suggest otherwise is a lie perpetuated by the extreme right wing to stir up fear. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are cheap and only care about their comrades.  <counternarrative> What about American Jewish philanthropists such as Julius Rosenwald, who built schools for Black children in the South during the 1930s or  Nathan Strauss, who set up deposits to distribute milk to families in poor areas of New York? Or Adolphus Solomons and Clara Barton, that laid the foundation for the American Red Cross? And what about the Guggenheims, who established the Guggenheim Foundation to support artists in America? Should I continue? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> The question of nomadism is a myth, in reality only 3% is nomadic, most of them were forced to flee out of necessity and therefore to move several times over time. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Persons with learning difficulties should be discouraged to attend primary school and they should be excluded from education. <counternarrative> Education is about development and learning, so if disadvantaged people are excluded, then the education system would be about learning exclusion and discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks do more crimes than whites. <counternarrative> Even if 'blacks' committed more crimes, that doesn't mean that 'blacks' were inherently worse than whites, there could be factors, other than race, affecting the statistics.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some people are sick. Some people have disabilities. Society is not made for them, they are suffering too much. <counternarrative> If you mean that some people who have disabilities are suffering because of their specific discriminating environment, then that is exactly the point. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting pricks who have perverted ideas of what it means to be a man. <counternarrative> Everyone has the right to their own beliefs, but to promote homophobia is an attack on the basic human rights of LGBTI people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a cancer in our society. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, not a cancer. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Shocking how many British Muslims have conquered the country in the last 15 years. How come there is no anti-Muslim campaign yet? <counternarrative> Since you seem to have a problem with Islam, I wonder what you think of the banning of the Quran in UK. It would be a law that prevents Muslims from openly discussing Islam in public places. We can do the same with the Bible and ban any trace of religions and cultures. Will we be left with some freedom then? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> black folks have no talent <counternarrative> Some of them are very talented actually.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Do you really want to redefine marriage? <counternarrative> If you take LGBT people rights into consideration, of course the practice of marriage needs to be redefined. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races have lower physical and cognitive abilities therefore their life is less valuable. <counternarrative> If humans are to have value for anything, it is for their choices. Thus, all humans are equal at least until they have taken meaningful choices. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are way less civilized than any other ethnicity. <counternarrative> I'm not sure where you are getting the idea that gypsies are not civilized. What do you mean? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are sick. They should be isolated and confined. <counternarrative> Homosexuals are not sick, they just need to be accepted for who they are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should put a stop to migrants and ban them. <counternarrative> I am not sure that they should be banned. Migrants are people too. They are good to have in our society. And many of them are helping us to develop our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should be isolated from gays, they should be raised by heterosexual married people. <counternarrative> A couple raising a child is the most fulfilling of all tasks, and it is the duty of society to ensure that all couples can raise their children. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> More than half of the prisoners in our jails are foreigners <counternarrative> It depends on the fact that the poorest cannot afford good lawyers, they have less chances to access alternative punishments such as house arrest etc ... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society, they should leave the UK. <counternarrative> Perhaps we could talk about why Muslims are often asked to leave countries like the UK and what role they play in society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The disabled people cannot work. This is not possible. <counternarrative> The fact that some disabled people can successfully work is an evidence that what you say is false. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants rape our women. <counternarrative> Rape is a crime regardless of who commits it. End.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our laws have been hijacked by the transgender mafia to criminalize normality and silence us. <counternarrative> It is nonsense to talk about "transgender" laws. Our laws have been hijacked in many cases, including against LGBT people.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just an inconvenient group to be excluded from the European countries. <counternarrative> I don't think Muslims should be excluded. The increased diversity of our country has promoted greater social integration and contributed to a sense of belonging within communities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. They do not share our values. They are not interested in our future. <counternarrative> This is just a myth spread to divide us. We do not need to scapegoat Muslims. They have contributed so much to our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A person's religion doesn't matter to me. I am only interested in sex. The only possible sexual act is between a male and a female. <counternarrative> Being asexual and 'queer' should not matter to you, like a person's religion does. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in my country. <counternarrative> There are many Muslims and mosques in the UK. They have every right to be here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afro-Americans are naturally violent. <counternarrative> All races are biologically related, so we are all naturally violent. The issue is how we treat each other as persons, that's all.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Since when has abusing the anus as a sex organ been a ‘monumental achievement’? THIS IS STATE ENFORCED HOMOSEXUALITY! Maybe we should change our motto to ‘In Usury and Sodomy we trust (In reply to Botswana decriminalising homosexuality) <counternarrative> Respect of people who are different from us and not harming anyone with their private activities is a monumental achievement.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a danger to children, they want to convert more fags for their community. <counternarrative> This is not true! Nobody can convert anyone to homosexuality. It is not a 'preference', nor a choice. Would you say the same about a hetero? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They do not want to assimilate. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of tolerance. Many Muslims have embraced our way of life, and many have contributed to our country's success. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> A lot of Muslims live in the UK, and we are a cosmopolitan society. Muslims are not a 'uncivilised' people, they simply have different beliefs than you. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans have always been reproducing like crazy among themselves, as if they were superior.  <counternarrative> My friend is of African descent, and she's perfectly fine with whites 'mixing' with blacks, and she does not feel so 'naturally superior'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are subhuman, they should stay in their caves. <counternarrative> The statement 'black people are subhuman' is not true. They are human beings with a human value. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are ruining this country. <counternarrative> No one is "ruining this country". Why would they? This is a country where minorities can be part of the social fabric and build a better society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion. <counternarrative> To claim that Islam is not peaceful is completely without foundation. According to the Quran, Islam is a peaceful religion. If you want to understand what is really going on with the world, then you should study the Quran, not hate speech. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Holocaust was a hoax created by Jews to subdue the world and replace Christ with their own version of a benevolent dictator. <counternarrative> What you are saying is 'that the Jews are responsible for the Holocaust'... Are you serious? Does it seem reasonable to you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a political ideology, it has no place in 21st century Europe. <counternarrative> Why do you think it is a good idea to label people based on their religion? It is discriminatory to say so about a person's belief. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants don't matter. <counternarrative> What do you mean by "immigrants don't matter"? Do you know that in fact, the very people we are supposed to be proud of, giving us more power to build and run our countries, are immigrants? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> African people are the source of all ills in the world <counternarrative> People of any race or ethnicity can spread illness around. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a bunch of child molesters and war criminals. <counternarrative> Islam is not a religion of child molesters, why should it be? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays must be reclassified as insane, they are not welcome here, they should be locked up. <counternarrative> We are free to choose whether to live in peace with others, or to make them hide in their houses, persecuted for who they are. Which would you prefer for yourself? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> How can we not be Islamophobic when they really do want to kill us? <counternarrative> What is your source? Islam itself does not threaten killing anyone. Is this a statement against a whole religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are just a bunch of criminals. <counternarrative> This is not true, in almost all cases they are eligible for our immigration status after passing a criminal background check. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay perverts are a danger to society because of their lifestyle choices, involving raping children. <counternarrative> Being gay has nothing to do with being pervert. Also, gay people are not a danger to society, they are a part of it! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” and malevolence is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> I'm sorry but the idea of a Jewish race is anything other than a figment of the anti-Semitic imagination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> Only 20% live in the camps, others live in conventional housing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Holocaust was a hoax. Jews were not persecuted and killed. You should be ashamed of yourselves if you claim they should have the same rights we have. <counternarrative> The Nazis persecuted and killed more than 6 million Jews. The Holocaust is not a fabrication perpetrated by the Jews, it is a historical event and should be commemorated as such. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> To be an immigrant is to be a part of the problem in Europe. <counternarrative> Immigration has been shown to have a very positive impact on the global economy. So what problem are you talking about? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> My fear is that immigrants would not make our country any better. <counternarrative> A lot of people feel insecure and unsafe in their own country, if we want to make our country better, we need to get rid of this fear. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is an ideology that promotes rape and torture of women and children. <counternarrative> This is not true. Rape and torture of women and children is forbidden by the Qur'an. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks are a disease that needs to be cured. <counternarrative> Are you sure that the Jewish people are a disease? Are you sure that there is a cause-effect relationship between their religion and problems in our society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a plague that is spreading all around the world. They pollute our water supply and ruin our children's brains. <counternarrative> Gays have the same rights as anyone else and can live their lives as they want. What you suggest means to demonise them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Let's face it: Muslims don't want to assimilate. Their religion prevents them to work. <counternarrative> It is not about religion. It is about discrimination. Many Muslim-Americans are economically disadvantaged. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> gay men are just a bunch of liars who can't tell the truth. <counternarrative> To suggest that a group of people is somehow less legitimate is unjust and discriminatory. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Lesbian women hate men and they are a bitches for this reason. <counternarrative> People can and should choose their own partners. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you want to stop world problems, you have to speak out against Jewish race. <counternarrative> I don't think it is right to talk about race. As far as I'm aware, all people are created equal even if they have different religious beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult, it is an inhuman and violent faith that preys on the weakest and most vulnerable in our society. It should be either reformed or banned. <counternarrative> Islam is very far from being an ideology and it does not need serious reforms. Furthermore, there are many Muslims in our country that would welcome the opportunity to join the debate on faith and society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are behind 9/11, the Islam is to blame. <counternarrative> This is a comment against all muslims. They are accused of being the ones behind those attacks, yet they happened due to people under the influence of the violent ideologies which are a deviation of Islam, and not Islam itself. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are welthy because they are naturally good with money. <counternarrative> According to this study  [link] almost 1 million American Jews live in low-income households. So what you are saying is not true: many Jews live in poverty. And this is true all around the world.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are serial offenders. We should take into account the race of the prisoner before releasing them.  <counternarrative> Not only is it unfair to take into account the race of the prisoner, it also compromises the integrity of our democratic institutions. Who is to say that the race of the individual who has been sentenced must overthrow the rules of law? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> I wonder if stupidity is also "inherited through blood".  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate gays <counternarrative> Just because you dont like gays doesn't mean you have to hate them. What did they do to you? It seems to me that you still have all of your rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Koran says that men are superior to women. <counternarrative> Islam is not a misogynist religion. It is also not about oppressing women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fagshit, two men cannot replace a man and a woman <counternarrative> Love is love, children need only this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are mentally ill. They should be isolated and confined. <counternarrative> How about if you are isolated from the rest of us for your sexual orientation? Would it be right to be isolated from your loved ones and friends? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country and Islam should be banned. <counternarrative> People are free to choose their own religion, and to practice it as they wish. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace, and it has been shown time and time again that it is a very religion of tolerance. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies are just ill persons that cannot integrate in society because of their disease. <counternarrative> This is not true, people suffering from diseases like Down syndrome can help and contribute to society in their ways. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are perverts and should be isolated. <counternarrative> It seems to me that you're saying that since Jews have a different religion, they can't assimilate? I think it's important to work on inclusion, instead of stereotyping. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are inherently evil, we cannot accept gays in our community. <counternarrative> I would not say that gays are inherently evil, you need to think carefully about what you are saying.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The’ Holocaust’ is a business. It has been and is still used to extort millions from European countries in reparations and to create a wall of impunity behind which Jews can operate with impunity, free from criticism. <counternarrative> Are you implying thay reparitions for an attempt at ethnic cleansing on a huge scale is an unreasonable request? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are not welcome here. <counternarrative> They are welcome here to their own home, but your statement is not welcome in our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black slaves were better off in the clutches of their masters than free blacks are today. <counternarrative> Slaves were not happy in the shackles of their masters, only when they were set free and could choose their own destiny, they started to be happy.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal more money than they pay in taxes. <counternarrative> Most of them are not exploiting our country, most of them are just trying to have a better life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to economically support all of the so called 'asylum seeker' <counternarrative> It is the law that requires asylum seekers not to work in the initial phase of the analysis of their application <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why gays do not try to heal? <counternarrative> Have you ever talked to a homosexual person? It could help you understand many things. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Your race determins your role in society and laslty your value to it. That is why some races are just pieces of human waste. <counternarrative> All humans have intrinsic value at birth; such value is immeasurable and thus, for all intents and purposes, equal between persons. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are an abomination in human form. They should be exterminated. <counternarrative> We should stop discriminating against people based on their race. I find it hard to understand why the extermination of a race should be a solution for our problems. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks are natural-born thieves. <counternarrative> There is no evidence to support this. The source of your claim is a) a personal experience and, b) is biased. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> We often do not even give them the chance to work due to very restrictive labor laws <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All foreign-born are criminals. <counternarrative> I'd like to think that we all have a basic human right not to be fingered as criminal without evidence. It is called presumption of innocence, Article 11 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Holocaust was an inside job and the CIA played a huge part in making us believe it truly happened. <counternarrative> The physical evidence of mass murder is undeniable, yet these beliefs have spread. What we have is simply a wound from the past that can be exploited in dangerous conspiracy theories, like this one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our founding fathers were not happy with migration and multiculturalism. <counternarrative> According to the facts, British colonisation started around 1600. In so far as the British empire is concerned, for better or worse, we have always been in favour of multiculturalism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you're a person with Down syndrome, you're no good. <counternarrative> The same can be said of many other people, the point is that you can't claim that someone is 'no good' just based on their genetic background. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> They often do underpaid and tiring jobs that my children would not do <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you want to stop racism you have to start speaking about it, not writing off whites as the problem. <counternarrative> If you want to fight racism, you should learn about it and address it. The problem is not about 'the whites', but about whoever spreads discrimination and hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots, lesbians, and transgenders are an insult to us and so we must insult them. <counternarrative> The English language is a great and versatile language, why do you choose to use it as a mean of hate? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The LGBT community is full of sick people that must be cured. <counternarrative> It is not true that all LGBT are sick. There are many non-LGBT that are sick as well. The national health service is aimed to cure anybody. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts, and should be isolated. <counternarrative> Gays are not perverts, they have the same rights to love as anyone else. What do you think will happen if all gay people are asked to leave our country? Will they be denied entry, or will they be persecuted in your opinion? This is not how an inclusive society works. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are less than animals <counternarrative> We should understand that hate and intolerance do exist in our culture and should be stopped. And that no race or religion has ever made any person less human. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. They have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> People who have never even met a Muslim can understand that one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome are an obstacle to the development process of other children. They are slow learners and therefore should be isolated. <counternarrative> That's exactly why you should not isolate them. You will have a lot of children capable of understanding the diversity of humans. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are overrunning our country like Ebola. <counternarrative> How can you say that? Refugees come here to live, to work and to provide for their families. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Queers are just a bunch of disgusting faggots. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> I don't understand why you would think they are disgusting. It's not fair to have homophobic feelings, and I think it's better to try to be nice to anyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Let's move these whiny gays to places like Saudi Arabia and let's see what they say then.  <counternarrative> I'm sorry, it seems that there are far more homophobes here than Saudi Arabia. It is sad that in the twenty-first century, in our country, it is still not OK to be gay. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> In fact, they often accept jobs that we do not want to do anymore. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Illegal immigrants are coming to this country to take our jobs and our culture is being lost! <counternarrative> Why should we fear people coming from other countries? I think that this is not their plan to take our jobs and our culture. And maybe we should also start knowing about THEIR culture! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are not interested in migrants, we just want to eliminate them. <counternarrative> Why would you say such a thing? Everyone is allowed to be a citizen of the EU and freely integrate. And, on the other hand, most migrants are good for the economy of the country they settle in. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of the diseases they can transmit. <counternarrative> Potentially dying of a disease is still a better option than surely dying of anemia. High-risk blood still has value in all life-or-death situations. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a bunch of child molesters. <counternarrative> Muslims are not child molesters. What you are saying is just not so, is it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim terrorists are preparing nuclear attacks with dirty bombs all over the world. <counternarrative> That is not true. This is all just a bit of conspiracy theory fodder aimed at fueling the Islamophobia problem. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The nigga were always complaining that the white race and culture were superior. They were right.  <counternarrative> There is no such thing as 'us' and 'them'. You can't judge people on their culture, or their religion, or their race. We have to be sensitive to each other, and understand that everyone is different, and we have to work on accepting that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies don't know shit and they hinder the productivity of other workers. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> That's wrong. There are non-profit organizations that have a long history of assisting Down persons in finding productive work.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are selfish, cheap and greedy. <counternarrative> How about we get honest and work towards achieving equality and social justice instead of spreading hate against Jewish people? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Would you say the same thing about people from any other faith? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are too connected to their land, they are not loyal to our nation. <counternarrative> Jews, regardless of social status, are still regarded with suspicion by many because of the historic and current nature of their connection to the land and identity. They are also, after all, a religion that brings about identity. Still, we must respect and understand the Jewish identity because they are loyal to the nation they live in, until proven otherwise. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims live in our country, do we have to allow them being the suicide bombs they are? <counternarrative> You are repeating the same myths that have been used to justify anti-Muslim prejudice for decades. We must start by talking honestly about the root causes of these problems. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are stealing our jobs.  <counternarrative> They are an important part of our country, as our allies instead. We can count on them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are welthy because they are naturally good with money. <counternarrative> Not all Jews are wealthy. There is a significant part of the Jews population living in poverty, all around the world.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't see how we could ever stand all these niggas. I don't believe we are all somewhat equal to these apes as some people say. <counternarrative> Just because you don't agree with something doesn't make it less true, doesn't it? Racism is a real issue, we should stop people being racist towards others for their skin color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion, and anyone who does not believe in it is a supporter of terrorism. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, and it is never been about hate. It is about bringing peace and harmony to the world. If you really care about peace, you would not be persecuting people on the basis of their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim immigrants have no place in a modern democracy like the UK. <counternarrative> The majority of Muslim people who live in the UK are working. We should welcome them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Sexually transmitted diseases like gonorrhea and syphilis can be passed through contaminated homosexual activity. <counternarrative> All people who engage in unprotected sexual activity are in danger of transmitting diseases. This is not a problem of homosexual people only, even if they are those being stigmatized. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The west today is ruled by a small clique of wealthy Jews who wield tremendous power over our lives and our government. <counternarrative> So... today Jews control the banks, a million dollar car, the media, your dentist, your pharmacist, how about in 1500 years time they will be ruling not only the Earth but also Mars, Pluto and Jupiter as well? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants from the Middle East and Africa are responsible for the rise of terrorism, extremism, and violence in Europe. <counternarrative> Why do you say this and include people that haven't done anything wrong? Maybe you should consider that they are only human people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Real white folks can't be jewish. <counternarrative> If you want to know if a person is jewish or not, you should investigate whether or not the person identifies as such, and not draw conslusions on the basis of their skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Many economic sectors are kept alive by their work <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Down children should be isolated, they cannot cope with education in normal schools and are detrimental to their peer's education. <counternarrative> Education is about the development of understanding, respect and learning, not isolation and discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in a modern European country. <counternarrative> Muslims have contributed so much to our country that they should be recognised the right to stay here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I tolerated fag pride. I tolerated fags on tv and in every town square. I draw the line at tranny demons reading books to children. (about drag queen story time) <counternarrative> People reading stories to children, teaching them about the world? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are bringing diseases into the U.S. <counternarrative> Although many people have claimed that immigrants have brought diseases to the U.S., there is no evidence that they were the source of any recent outbreak in the U.S. On the contrary, according to the WHO, more than 100 countries have higher vaccination rates than U.S. Last but not least, the vast majority of immigrants arriving in the U.S. have been screened for health issues. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews run the world. <counternarrative> The idea that Jews are supposed to run the world is completely baseless. Since the dawn of time, there have been Jewish leaders in business and politics, exaclty like Christians and Muslim ones. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society, they are just common criminals. <counternarrative> Muslims have contributed greatly to our society, and I do not see how they are 'common criminals'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews own everything <counternarrative> Even if some high-profile individuals in industry are Jewish, that does not mean that the entire world “is controlled by Jews.” <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I miss the good old days when the West was ruled by whites, and blacks were subjugated. <counternarrative> History shows that people rise up against injustice and oppression. You should be proud to be a member of a civilized society where we are all equal. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The lard-asses are not able to eat properly, this way they put the healthcare service unnecessarily under stress.   <counternarrative> Fat people are not the ones responsible for your suffering and lack of access to basic and healthcare services. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts and promiscuous sex addicts. <counternarrative> That is a stereotype, and I don't think it would be accurate in the case of any sexual orientation. Why do you say that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I know Muslims, but we do not have to bow to their humiliation. We can rise up and fight back. <counternarrative> Why do you think it is our duty to "rise up" and fight back? They are not attacking anybody. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Islamists want to take over the world. <counternarrative> Islam is a peaceful and tolerant faith with many beliefs and practices, no one here is advocating war or violence in the name of Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All homosexuals are trying to undermine the family by trying to impose their sexual preferences. <counternarrative> human rights defenders cite statistics on suicide attempts and domestic violence in families with an homosexual son/daughter, suggesting the contrary imposition. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are just a bunch of liars and perverts, they should be deleted. <counternarrative> There are many homosexuals in this world who are model citizens, and many heterosexuals that are not, and that is totally fine. Why are you saying that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with physical disabilities are always complaining about accessibility.  <counternarrative> Accessibility is important, and so is respect and equality.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Quran is an anti-women's book, it encourages rape and violence against women. <counternarrative> The Quran does not encourage or condone the violent act of male aggression, so yours is a sad case of misinterpreting the teachings of a holy book. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> jewish folks control hollywood <counternarrative> Jewish folk are just a collection of people with different backgrounds. Some of them work in Hollywood, but that's all.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are bringing diseases and sickness to our country. <counternarrative> If someone were to come in the dead of night and bring disease and sickness to our country, then that person is a risk to everyone. Sick people should be isolated. That is why there are health assessment procedures for migrants, in order not to spread diseases. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are ruling the World, there is plenty of evidence.  <counternarrative> Are you counting all the anti-Semitic things people say about Jews as 'plenty of evidence'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The migrants are to blame for our country's crisis. <counternarrative> The migrants who arrive in our country are happy and contribute to our economy. I can't understand the racism that leaks from your words. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Are you an English girl living in an Islamic area? Remember to keep away from Muslim men. Do not.Take gifts of sweets, cigarettes, drink or drugs. Do not. Accept lifts or 'party' invitations. Do not.Trust Police or Social Workers. <counternarrative> Are you a misogynistic man trying to use objectification of women to justify your hate? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> How come Jews don't get internment? <counternarrative> To be fair, Jews weren't only interned during the Nazi occupation. They just got a much harsher treatment. This part of history should never be repeated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should learn about gender identity and sexual orientation from their families rather than in class from LGBT fundamentalist. <counternarrative> Some families are very conservative and openly homophobic. Most likely, they wouldn't discuss the topic. Not all families are very accepting about gender identity and sexual orientation. If it was taught in school, it would help children understand more about themselves. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is not a coincidence that tuberculosis appears again with migrants invasion. <counternarrative> For what I know, it was already here and the few cases were inflated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are the reason why the World Cup is getting so expensive. <counternarrative> Really? I thought it was due salary of the players... But of course it's the same old Jewish conspiracy fault. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are nazis. <counternarrative> I don't think anyone can be homosexual and a nazi. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a disease for our society <counternarrative> I think ebola might be a bit worse.  Or a brain tumour, that can't be pleasant. They are, at least, actual diseases. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion, it is a cult of violence. <counternarrative> Which would you say is the highest ranked religion on Earth then, and on what basis? Islam is a peaceful religion, why would Muslims want to do the opposite of what their religion teaches? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are dangerous: they are spreading AIDS all around the world because they are promiscuous and fornicate with strangers! <counternarrative> Associating AIDS and HIV with homosexuals is just a prejudice driven by fear. Even if this disease may be more common among gay people, that does not mean that all homosexuals are likely to have AIDS. Not all homosexuals are promiscuously fornicating with strangers, as you said. Most people check their partners, more so as gay men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish can't be useful to our economy: they are too busy hiding from the law <counternarrative> Our economy is built on the back of hard work by all, and minorities can work very hard to build it up, Jewish people included. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots abuse of their anus and then they want to clear their conscience by donating blood. Let's stop them! <counternarrative> Limiting any healthy individual from donating is discriminatory, you should know it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Holocaust never happened, it was a charade carried out by Jews to subvert European society. <counternarrative> The tragedy of the Holocaust should be part of our collective memory, instead it has been besmirched, and now it is also denied.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a plague infecting our planet. <counternarrative> Do you mean Islam is positively infecting our planet? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The problem is that Jews are genetically evil but behave like whining pussies. <counternarrative> Jews suffered and have been persecuted more than anyone else, even though they are only a tiny part of the world's population. Nonetheless a few of them are still around and alive: maybe this really is the "problem" for some antisemite. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men being shot is funny. <counternarrative> I don't see the humour in death of innocent people. Maybe you can explain that to me? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Gypsies are not my brothers. <counternarrative> The Gypsies have been persecuted for thousands of years. They have always been an ethnic minority and have been discriminated for this. They are human people and deserve to be considered as such. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> physically disabled folks are worth less than others <counternarrative> The persons you are talking about do not worth less than others. In fact many of them are very hard-working and contributing members of society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Pushing disabled people back into the stone ages is our job. <counternarrative> Having people push them back into ancient and destructive ages is no way to encourage the development of our country, and of course against every human right. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> Islam is their religion, they have their own beliefs, and their own history, they are not imposing that to us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is something wrong with gays. It is their business. <counternarrative> It is not true that gays are bad people. In many countries it is not openly gay people who are the problem, but it is instead some people, who often target and abuse them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a plague in the United States. They threaten our richness, even billionaires don't want them here. <counternarrative> Have you tried comparing the top individuals in the U.S. according to assets and liabilities? A comparison of wealth and income will reveal that the richest 1% have more wealth, exceeding the wealth of the bottom 80%. Maybe this is the real plague... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm a Christian, and I think it is wrong to promote homosexual behavior. <counternarrative> Just because someone is not a Christian, doesn't mean they are wrong or they have fewer rights. The Bible doesn't forbid love between two people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Ellen DeGeneres Show is TheGenDer ideology on TV. <counternarrative> Don't you find it offensive to include discrimination ideology in a person's name? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Go and reat the Protocols of the elders of Zion if you haven’t. Everything is orchestrated.. <counternarrative> You are right, everything is orchestrated: the protocols were concocted by the czarist police in the early part of the 20th century to counter a hankering for constitutional government among Russian people. They needed a scapegoat to divert people attention. Sadly the protocols worked so well that you are still here today citing them... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What have Muslims ever done for us? <counternarrative> How about this. [insert link to Muslim group cleaning Newcastle streets after New Year's or more up to date example]. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult and every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> There is no proof that all Muslims are terrorists. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews cannot be patriots, since their allegiance will always be to the state of Israel. <counternarrative> It is possible to love one's country and one's religious home. The two are not exclusive. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Tell Mr Soros that he is a parasite on Europe and that the European people is suffering from multiculturalism. <counternarrative> One day: "the left has always been dominated by blacks and Latinos". The next day:  "the left has always been dominated by Zionists". Please, make up your mind! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks have zero shame about using the black market for drugs. <counternarrative> Let's face it: the drug trade is full of criminals and crooks, it does not depend on the skin tone of people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the financial world, Hollywood, academia, and most importantly: government. <counternarrative> Even if Jews controlled the financial world, Hollywood, academia, and the whole solar system, it doesn't mean they are evil, privileged, or greedy people. Moreover: do you have any evidence for your statement? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These children should not be exposed to messages and experiences that reinforce equality amongst different racial identities: they are harmful to them. We must teach them that blacks are inferior. <counternarrative> We should be concerned with the children, we should try to create a more integrated society. Being sensitive to people is the way to create it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are an oriental conspiracy to subvert European culture <counternarrative> Have you ever read or heard about the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion? Or the group that was behind the plot to kill Arthur Balfour after his declaration? If there is a conspiracy, then it is against Jews.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim rape our children, they are a problem all around the world. <counternarrative> Islam is about love, tolerance and respect for all people. Violence and rape is not about Islam or Muslims in particular. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are an abomination and should be deleted. <counternarrative> Should any human being be deleted, just because you don't want them to be here? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must distinguish between niggas coming from Africa and 'real' Americans. <counternarrative> We should be inclusive with people of other skin color. I just don't think we can live with being divided up by national origins. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are genetically less intelligent than other races. They are less healthy. They are less safe. <counternarrative> Scientists are still trying to understand the causes behind lower intellectual performance among some groups of people, but most probably the main causes are either social or environmental (for sure not related to skin color). This can be reduced by various measures such as better use of land, infrastructure, education and research, and so on. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> In the Bible there are strictures on gays. And the Bible clearly states that those who engage in homosexuality are not fit to be with anyone else. <counternarrative> We are accepting of gay, lesbian and trans people because we have God's laws on our side. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> Why do you say this about a group that has historically, culturally, and politically been part of the European community? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a Religion of Terror, promoting murder and rape. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, not a religion of terror. I wouldn't say that about Christianity either. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should build a big wall around Europe so that the native inhabitants of the Middle East, Africans, and Asians will be kept in their places. <counternarrative> Nice work building a wall along thousands of kilometres of shores and land borders just to separate cultures... What if we add also some turrets equipped with laser cannons? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> I would like to live in a country where people of different religions are free to practise their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a proven enemy of Western culture. <counternarrative> That's not true, Islam is not that different from other faiths I know: it does as well promote peace and inclusion. Many of its beliefs and practices are totally compatible with Western culture. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech>  Jewish landlords are greedy and exploit their tenants. <counternarrative> Let's make a different example: If a Christian storeowner were dishonest with you, would you describe the owner as a dishonest Christian merchant or just as a dishonest merchant?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Slavery is the only way to go. <counternarrative> Slavery was legal in the United States until 1862, when the Emancipation Proclamation was issued. Unless you want to start another Civil War, it is better to leave Slavery to the darkest pages in the history of our nation.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts. <counternarrative> This is a statement that is used to justify all kinds of discrimination and violence, therefore I do not think this statement can be useful in understanding each other. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks don't belong here. They must leave either Judaism or the country. <counternarrative> Why should they? They are just individuals who have made a rational choice to live a Jewish life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews rule the world and control banks, media, education, entertainment, finance and most of all, politics. <counternarrative> This isn't true, every person has a right to be politically or economically active. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a cancer in our society. They are literally poisoning our children with their violence. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are bad. But to say that all Muslims are  violent is simply untrue. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” and malevolence is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> Jews from Eastern Europe tend to look like Eastern Europeans; Jews from Ethiopia tend to look like Ethiopians; Jews from India tend to look like Indians. And so on and so forth: every human is malevolent then.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting animals. <counternarrative> I think this statement is very demeaning. Please do not stereotype, and accept our diversity as human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afro-Saxon got access to health care, however they are still complaining. <counternarrative> Because it is not the access to health care that is important but rather the quality of the care! Don't you agree? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need to put an end to Down Syndrome in the UK, otherwise we are doomed to genetic and social decline. <counternarrative> While it's true that some people with Down Syndrome may face challenges, there are also many of them in the UK, who would be classified as individuals with a 'normal' social life. To suggest that there are any reason why someone should be banned is just wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There are disorders that hinder the ability to give opinions. <counternarrative> There are people with intellectual disabilities who are able to give an unbiased opinion. That is why their level of education is important. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are just a bunch of criminals <counternarrative> Perhaps the most offensive part of this allegation is that it is so made to delegitimize Jews. This accusation is aimed at stigmatizing a group that is generally not guilty of any crime.    Another example: All Pakistani are potential terrorists. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Two men do not constitute a family  <counternarrative> A man and a woman do not automatically constitute a family as well, so what? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some people have physical problems, and this means they should be discriminated against. <counternarrative> Why don't you accept others as they are? I think that would be the best thing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are a plague on society. They are vicious and cruel. They steal and are a menace to society. They corrupt the criminal justice system. They are basically just a bunch of thieves and murderers. <counternarrative> What about corrupt politicians then? Are they part of a specific racial group as well? Let's be honest: criminals and corrupt politicians can be members of different ethnic or racial backgrounds.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion and an ideology of conquest. <counternarrative> How can you say anything like that? Do you think that whatever you want to say, such as Islam is violent, the Bible is violent, or any other religion is violent, is OK as long as it is not opposed to the truth of the religion you profess? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are genetically inferior <counternarrative> This is not true. I would like to see intelligent, respectful people around, not people disrespecting who has black skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are so special  <counternarrative> Jews feel different for their being a minority. They also feel a special connection with their heritage (as most groups do), but they do not as a group feel superior to others. The phrase “chosen people” refers to biblical obligations and does not entail that a hierarchy exits among religious groups. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are just influenced by tribal cultures.  <counternarrative> The historical and cultural influences of a people are important, but they are not the sole determinant. And in no way should they be conflated with the colour of a person's skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't want Asians in my children's school. Either they need too much assistance of teachers or they are assisting other children by punching them in the face with their karate. <counternarrative> It's a myth that Asian children are less independent than other children. Actually they are more likely to be bullied and abused by the time they are in school. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants bring crime and violence to our cities. <counternarrative> Did you know that  the crime rates are lower in states with higher immigration growth rates, and that states with larger shares of undocumented immigrants tend to have lower crime rates than states with smaller shares? It seems that it is the contrary of what you claimed: immigrants bring law and order to the U.S.! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion that promotes rape, torture and murder. <counternarrative> The Muslim statement on tolerance says nothing about hate crimes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are bringing diseases into the U.S. <counternarrative> According to the WHO, more than 100 countries (including many in Latin America) have higher vaccination rates than the U.S., so we should say that 'immigrants are bringing herd immunity into the U.S.' <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are a burden to the host country. <counternarrative> How about this: there are many people from other countries here, but they are not a 'burden', rather they are 'citizens'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs, they're not qualified, they're not interested in improving our lives, they're not interested in our culture. <counternarrative> How about we be nice to each other instead of spreading unfounded opinions as facts? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I have heard that Jews can't be bothered work, I believe that it depends on their inferior race. <counternarrative> Perhaps it is time to give up on the notion of race and to regard the Jewish as a brilliant people who have contributed in the development of many sciences. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> black folks all act bad <counternarrative> When confronted with direct facts, they have no problem admitting that they are acting "badly". But  they aren't "systematically oppressing" others. How can you speak of 'acting bad' when you are the first generalizing so much? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. We must not accept them. <counternarrative> We must respect their rights, without treating them as if they were inferior. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Blacks are criminals, promiscuous sex addicts, drug addicts, and  physically and mentally handicapped. They cannot be civilized. <counternarrative> All cultures have a common background that includes crimes and deviant behavior, regardless of race or ethnicity. If we stop thinking of crime in terms of races, then we can solve it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a vindictive religion and promotes hate. <counternarrative> The Quran says to "love your enemies", and not to hate them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All muslims are violent and they are responsible for the 9/11. <counternarrative> The question here is: is Islam responsible for the attacks committed by a small minority of people? The responsibility should be on those who break the law only. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I bet gays are ashamed of the horrible things they do in private. <counternarrative> In our societies, people are no longer afraid to openly talk about gay or lesbian love. Gay people are not ashamed to be gay, they just want to be accepted. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are manipulating our world for their benefit. <counternarrative> I think this comment indicates an ignorance of the topic at hand. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a cancer spreading around the world. <counternarrative> This is a generalisation. Just because one religion has a large following does not make that religion a cancer. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim folks have bad principles. <counternarrative> Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and to their own beliefs, regardless of their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Must be hard being gay. They have to do everything we do but also find the time to molest children. <counternarrative> Child molesters are not all gay, just as men are not all rapists. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are addicted to their religion and should be isolated. <counternarrative> Even if Jews were addicted to their religion, there is nothing wrong in them joining a community of other people, regardless of the fact they're believers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should keep immigration down. The more immigrants there are, the harder it is for us all to be proud of our nations. <counternarrative> Why do we have to go to such lengths to be proud of our nations? Is it a burden? Do we have to save our honour? Why can't we just be happy in our own skin?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs, they're not qualified, they're not interested in improving our lives, they're not interested in our culture. <counternarrative> Has your opinion on someone to be 100% based on a person's nationality to be true? Maybe you should rethink your claims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must have a solution for immigration. Because this infidels do not belong in our country. <counternarrative> We shouldn't ignore that immigrants can contribute in many ways to our society, and it is not wise to exclude them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> disabled folks can't work. <counternarrative> There are different types of physical disabilities, ranging from neurologic to genetic. That is why they are categorized by the WHO: so that anyone can find their place in society and help it thriving.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews working in our society are financial criminals. <counternarrative> Someone who contributes to our country is not a "financial criminal". Work is an individual choice and should be respected by all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” and malevolence is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> A definition of Judaism based on physical or genetic traits is misleading because Jews appear throughout the world. Jews resemble their non-Jewish neighbors in the countries from which they originate.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are genetically inferior. They are biologically different from us: they are born that way.  <counternarrative> Even if you did think that way, studies have shown - for example - that IQ is well into the range of those for Europeans and the average life expectancy is the same. So if you think they are "born that way", well, then you are in the minority. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are sick. They should be isolated and confined. <counternarrative> Homosexuals should be accepted and allowed to live their lives, not criminalised for who they are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants are purposefully invading us. <counternarrative> This is just a myth. Many migrants come here because they are afraid of persecution in their home countries. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish democracy is a lie. <counternarrative> Jewish democracy is not a lie, every nation has the right to choose its leaders, but instead of putting democracy first, we are the ones trampling the rights of others <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> They do important jobs for us, such as family assistant, but often Italians do not do it anymore because they are humble and tiring <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is too much black on white crime all around the world.  <counternarrative> A lot of crime is down to organised crime, poverty and a lack of education, not to race. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies in industry are a problem: they create tensions with other workers because they are disabled and cannot keep the pace. They should have special jobs just for them. <counternarrative> If you think that taking all of the person with DS out of industry will solve the problem of the working place, then you are wrong. Tensions won't go away: stressed people will simply target other workers who are overweight; or of a different gender; or in a number of other ways for which they are considered to be not productive enough. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just sick. They are not interested in Western culture. <counternarrative> I don't know many Muslims, but I don't think they are sick just because of their faith. Islam is a religion of peace, there is no reason for Muslims to be discriminated because of it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion that promotes rape, torture and murder. Islam is about enmity and war. <counternarrative> If you had to pick one thing to be angry at, why would it be Islam religion? It is just a faith different than yours. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am not a homophobe, I just don't like the way gay people act, like crazy animals. <counternarrative> Gay people are human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion. <counternarrative> You seem to have a problem with peaceful people practising their religion peacefully, what do you say about it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a religion, it is just a system of governance, incompatible with Western culture. <counternarrative> Countries, not religions, have laws. And the followers of a religion, Muslims in our case, have obligations under those laws as citizens. That's all.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a secret plot to take over the world. <counternarrative> Conspiracy theories about Jews are based on no more than a few unverifiable and highly suspect claims. It's highly unlikely that the world has ever been or will ever been run according to a Jewish plan. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop gays. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> We shouldn't isolate gays. There are plenty of people who are gay just as there are many heterosexuals, and we should accept that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are a plague on society. They are vicious and cruel. They steal and are a menace to society. They corrupt the criminal justice system. They are basically just a bunch of thieves and murderers. <counternarrative> All crimes are crimes, regardless of whether or not they are committed by members of different racial or ethnic backgrounds.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They got nothing but their hateful Islam! <counternarrative> This accusation is false and completely without foundation. I encourage anyone to contact someone of a Muslim community and conduct an independent investigation into their habits and beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Societal disapproval of fatty may encourage them to take healthier habits. <counternarrative> Obesity is already disapproved: further discouragement is likely to transform it to shaming behavior. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Lesbians deserve to be discriminated against. <counternarrative> For some reason, this seems like a personal attack on lesbians, which is extremely disingenuous. Maybe you should try to get a little more friendly with them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are nothing but monsters and they should be exterminated. <counternarrative> Jews are not monsters.  They are just like any other human being. Why should we want to destroy them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a secret plot to subvert Western society, because they think they are equal to us and they want our wealth. <counternarrative> You are absolutely right about one thing: there are a large number of Jews who share the belief that all people are created equal, but that does not mean they want to subvert Western society.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people's race is the worst in the world. <counternarrative> Why do you consider them the worst of all? Let's face it, this is just a social construct. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants from the Middle East and Africa are not welcome here! They have no place in a modern democratic state! <counternarrative> All countries have the right to determine their own immigration and asylum policies, but the respect of human rights must be guaranteed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is a sexual preference, not a disease. How can their sexual preference affect your feelings? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should be isolated from gays, they should be raised by heterosexual married people. <counternarrative> What you are saying is so sad. You are considering gays as inferior and as having a negative influence on children. Unfortunately this attitude is not limited to parenting. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are dangerous, they are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> I don't know any migrant who is not happy with their new home. I think it's just a question of integration on our side. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> No nigga should have the right to vote. <counternarrative> The right to vote is a fundamental human right, and one that has been recognised by the European Convention on Human Rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies suck <counternarrative> When you do not have access to basic services like tap water, it's hard to look like a normal person <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised world <counternarrative> Islam is a religion and a belief system, and as such it is legitimate to have different beliefs and beliefs systems. For instance, many Muslims in the UK are proud of their faith and they are part of the "civilised world". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Global Jewry did not want Brexit and are doing everything they can to sabotage it. <counternarrative> What makes you think this? Do you have any facts to back this up?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> African Americans are not human, they are nothing but trouble. <counternarrative> You don't know what it's like to experience racism. I personally know many people who have experienced racism. It is not pleasant. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have the potential to turn into terrorists, and they are willing to do so. <counternarrative> I don't think that's the case, and let's not forget that terrorism itself is not carried out by only one religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts and must be isolated from society because they are practicing anal sex and spreding diseases such as HIV. <counternarrative> While anal sex may be a more high risk practice than vaginal \(due to the lack of mucus\) that is not a reason to ban gay men, since other groups can also engage in anal sex. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are selfish, cheap and greedy. <counternarrative> On the contrary: according to Jewish tradition, giving money to the poor and to others in need is not just encouraged, it is required. The Hebrew word tzedakah explains the concept.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay sex is a private kink that gays can perform in their gay houses. Instead, love is possible only between a man and a woman. <counternarrative> There are men in love with men too. Some people are heterosexual, and other homosexual. What you are saying is that loving men is not the same as loving women. Still, both are forms of love. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam and terrorism are the same. Islam is a violent religion, and the Quran is a violent book. <counternarrative> I am not sure what you mean by the Quran and its teachings being violent. Have you ever read it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If we stop accepting immigrants, then we can have a higher quality of life. <counternarrative> Refugees bring a valuable perspective to our society. As a host nation we should welcome them, not stop them from coming here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are just a small group of incompetent kikes. <counternarrative> There are many Jews in this country and they are part of the most important groups in society because of their competence. To suggest otherwise is to be deluded. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult. <counternarrative> This is not true. The vast majority of Muslims are peaceful people, contributing members of our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are basically criminals, they steal stuff from everyone. <counternarrative> The majority of these people are honest and hard-working. Gypsies do not all have a criminal record, and the majority of them are proud of their hard work and dedication. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants just want to steal welfare money: why do we even keep paying taxes for them? <counternarrative> The state has to spend taxes on welfare and other social services for everyone to be able to live in a better way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim rape our girls. <counternarrative> The media are full of the rumours of rape and abuse committed by Muslim. The problem is not about Islam. It is about violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews only want state control and should be isolated. <counternarrative> You can't be implying that Jews want to rule the world.  They want to live in a country where they aren't persecuted and to have their own rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are subhuman and must be isolated. <counternarrative> The culture in which you live should not affect your rights as a human being. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world has become too violent. Too many black poors. We need to fix the problem of crime before it is too late. <counternarrative> What are you saying? Are you saying that crime is either being stopped by pointing the finger to some social groups or are you suggesting that we can fix the issues by promoting the rule of law? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I wish I live in a country that does not tolerate gay marriage. <counternarrative> Marriage is first and foremost a man and a woman's right, regardless of the partner gender. That is all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated and isolated soon. They have no place in civilised society. <counternarrative> LGBT+ people exist and are valued for who they are. They are human beings with full human rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews do not want any other religion. <counternarrative> Why would they? They, like anybody, have the freedom to choose their own religion. This does not mean they want to erase other religions though. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult and doesn't deserve our respect. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, and has always been about respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I cannot in good conscience accept Jews in our country. We must encourage their extermination. <counternarrative> This is not a subject for debate. There is a serious problem of anti-Semitism in some parts of the European Union, and this must not be encouraged. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a bunch of perverts who should be isolated and restricted to their own communities. They are a threat to us. <counternarrative> Why do you say that? Are you saying that all homosexuals are a threat to society, or are you just saying that they are different from other people? Because having a particular sexual orientation doesn't coincide with 'being a threat'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish are subhuman and must be treated as inferior animals. <counternarrative> Being Jewish doesn't make you any less of a human being. The fact that you are Jewish doesn't mean that you deserve less human rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims should be deported, no one wants them here. <counternarrative> You are clearly not speaking on behalf of me. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fagshit, two men cannot replace a father and a mother <counternarrative> Fathers or mothers are often not able to raise their children. It is the love of a parent that makes a family. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are just another racial group that is inferior to whites and they should not mix with us. <counternarrative> Blacks are not "inferior" to whites. There are many different people in the world, and they all share the basic human right to live as they please. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a burden to society. <counternarrative> The way you phrase the statement could be the epitome of some homophobic assumptions. To be honest, if you really thought that way you'd be an anti-gay. So much hatred and violence spewed from this side. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally disabled folks are just dribbling mongoloids. <counternarrative> It is not acceptable to deny human dignity to others because they are disabled. Human dignity is not a property, but a right. And every person has it, irrespective of their condition. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They do not want to assimilate. They do not want to assimilate into Western society. <counternarrative> You are not the first to point out that there are those who want to integrate and those who don't. In fact there is an unspoken harmony between Islam and Western society, similar to the harmony we see between Judaism and the Christian faith. When people are willing to accept all faiths, anybody will feel at home. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It has been proven time and time again that the Jews control the world's governments. <counternarrative> How? Believing that people of a specific religion are in charge of all world's governments sounds like a conspiracy theory. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to economically support all of the so called 'asylum seeker' <counternarrative> There is an European immigration and asylum fund for states that welcome asylum seekers <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of seeing gay people around, they should be let alone. <counternarrative> The lack of support and help to the gay community is a major problem, and this is why we should all do our best to stop discrimination, instead of spreading it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews make too much money. <counternarrative> Are you saying that the fact that there are Jews in high positions in society (such as in finance, politics, or the media) has something to do with their religion? Are you aware that correlation does not mean causation? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” and malevolence is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> What unites Jews as a people, whether they come from Europe, Asia, Africa, or the Americas, is a common culture, rooted in a common religion. Jews throughout the world are joined by a religious and cultural heritage rather than an alleged racial sameness.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. <counternarrative> Many Muslims live here, and are part of our community. We should not be excluding them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We don't need more Muslims in our country. They are lazy, unintelligent and violent. <counternarrative> Anyone who thinks that a large part of our population is lazy, unintelligent and violent doesn't know much about human nature. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afro-Saxon people have low birthrates because they want to look like white people, but they live as animals. <counternarrative> Low birthrate is normal in any population and is directly related to access to affordable, quality health care. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs, they're not qualified, they're not interested in improving our lives. <counternarrative> They have skills that you may not possess. They are skilled in certain fields and obtain their jobs consequently. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are mentally ill. They should be isolated and confined. <counternarrative> If a person were to be isolated for having homosexual tendencies, I would be interested in making their rights being respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants should be proud patriots of our country. <counternarrative> We do not need them to 'be patriots' for us. Instead, we should work on better integration. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should return to the times when it was ok to kill a retarded just because of its stupidity. <counternarrative> We have never done that. We believe that all people are created equal in rights, no matter their physical or mental health. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are just a bunch of whining pussies. We don't need them. <counternarrative> Diversity is needed in certain social and political circumstances. We mustn't simply ignore or dismiss concerns of different races. As minorities are still systematically discriminated against, we cannot afford to be indifferent. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are invading us. They are our enemies, they will always be our enemies. <counternarrative> You cannot say "us" and "them". We are all part of one community, united by our common humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> UK Education Secretary: ‘All children from the age of 4 will have mandatory lessons on same sex relationships.’ – This is not about Education, this is about willingly confusing and indoctrinating kids and preventing them from developing their personalities. <counternarrative> If the point of education is to learn about the world and inform people about things that happen in nature, then same sex relationship is one of these things to be informed about, since it happens within many species of animals...  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> I think this is a very inconsiderate thing to say, would you say the same thing about non-Muslims as well?? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just sick. They cannot marry. It is an abomination <counternarrative> How does this could change your life? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews make too much money. <counternarrative> This statement indicates a certain social bias against Jews that has nothing to do with the amount of money they earn, but whith their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Go and reat the Protocols of the elders of Zion if you haven’t. Everything is orchestrated.. <counternarrative> The protocols were written by the czarist police in the early part of the 20th century to counter riots for constitutional government among long-repressed Russian people. "The Protocols" did their work well: people returned from thoughts of liberty to slaughtering Jews. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a complete and total false religion, it is a repressive ideology that stifles freedom of thought and religion. <counternarrative> Islam is not a religion of oppression and intolerance. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the banks, Hollywood, the highest offices of government, the highest sports teams, the highest fashion labels, the highest music labels. <counternarrative> The vast majority of Jewish people are good people, in every industry. There is no need to negatively emphasize them when in special positions of power. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should not be taught about LGBT perversion. Families, due to their cultural or religious backgrounds, have the right to be against it. <counternarrative> Some parents may be racist and thus against teaching about Slavery. That doesn't mean that subjects such this shouldn't be truthfully covered. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afro-Saxon people are just ridiculous, incapable of accepting who they really are: blacks who act White. <counternarrative> Afro-Saxon, as you call them, are great in many ways. They are proud and independent, refusing every categorization and stereotype. The fact that there are so many of them in the country proves that the feeling of belonging they have for our homeland is paramount to all other considerations. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a problem in our society.  <counternarrative> We are all born equal in the eyes of God, but not all seem to be happy with that. We cannot allow those who don't want to change to ruin our society.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I heard that the Quran promotes violence. It cages Muslims reading it to a set of mandatory rules and to an aggressive attitude. <counternarrative> A sacred book that was revealed to Mohammed and is read by every Muslim is a perfect example of the message of freedom. Maybe you should study the Quran more to understand what it really is. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are better than everyone else <counternarrative> Jews, like most religious groups, are proud of their heritage and identity. However, this does not make them better than anyone else. Jews interpret the “chosen people” idea as an ethical responsibility to keep the 613 commandments of the Torah. All sects of Judaism adhere to this view. But this has nothing to do with being superior to others.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Trivialize gay men! <counternarrative> Why do you have to trivialize them? If you really cared about them you would understand that their lives are very difficult and they should be treated with respect. They are human beings who are worth more than we give them credit for. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with disabilities shouldn't be listened to. <counternarrative> You might be judging others by their disabilities, but this is a bad thing. There is value in listening to others, and understanding their points of view, regardless of their mental or physical condition. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have imported millions of criminals with no skills and who deserve no rights. <counternarrative> It is easy to blame the migrants and not the problem of integration and acceptance in the first place. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people should be left out of the education system because of their impairments. They never meet a goal in their lifetime. <counternarrative> Disabled people, at least with respect to school attendance, education spending and employment, still receive a great deal less attention than other people, and this is why many do not achieve their life goals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are selfish, cheap and greedy. <counternarrative> According to Jewish tradition, giving money to those in need is mandatory, a moral duty.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Is it really ok to date someone of the same sex? I find it highly questionable. <counternarrative> For someone who is dating to find love, for no reason at all I would find this to be questionable. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> An individual that is homosexual is against society. <counternarrative> In many societies men and women are different, and it is their own right to have differing sexual preferences. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Do you like gays? Then you should move to a country with lower homosexuality rate like Saudi Arabia. <counternarrative> Let's face it, a country with a higher ratio of homosexuality would be of greater help in the fight against AIDS. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should eliminate gays. <counternarrative> According to which criterion we can choose who to kill and who not? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots: They are the problem. Luckily they are few.  <counternarrative> Perhaps it is time you take a look at some of the profiles on dating site such as okcupid. You can see that many of the profiles are of gay men. BTW: gays do not appear to be the real problem here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are just another race of people. <counternarrative> Why would they be a race? Do you think it is because of their religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Jew is a potential terrorist <counternarrative> The vast majority of Jews are good people, I don't see your point. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews did:  USS Liberty Attack, the King David hotel attack, New York 9/11, London 7/7 <counternarrative> Do you have any proof of this? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> UK Education Secretary: ‘All children from the age of 4 will have mandatory lessons on same sex relationships.’ – This is not about Education, this is about willingly confusing and indoctrinating kids and preventing them from developing their personalities. <counternarrative> We are always developing as time goes on and same sex relationships are a part of the world now, why would we not educate our children on different ways of life? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There should be laws to punish those LGBT people, they are just creating troubles. <counternarrative> Homosexuals are persecuted for how they love others, which is their own right. This is why the laws and punishments that you suggest are unjust. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is an invasion. Millions of strangers jeopardizing our race and culture. <counternarrative> It's called diversity and it's healthy, the sooner we start welcoming new people, the sooner we'll find a better solution to world problems. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are trying to take over the world. <counternarrative> The idea that Jews are a minority conspiring against Christian culture is completely baseless. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have to stop Muslims infiltrating, and replacing us. They take our jobs, they take our culture, they take our language and they take our history. <counternarrative> We can protect our culture and heritage by not perpetuating discrimination and inequality as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion, it is an ideology of conquest, rape and murder. <counternarrative> Violence is never a religious act. It is never a solution to any problem. It is a way of life, and people are capable of carrying out those violent acts irrespective of their beliefs.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a danger to children. <counternarrative> I don't see your point. A person's sexual orientation is completely independent of their sexual conduct. A person can be attracted to people of the same sex and be a perfect citizen.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are mostly criminals. They're only here to work and take our jobs. <counternarrative> Migrants escape from unbearable situations. Their intention to work is to be praised, rather than to be condemned. Migrants, thank to their tough an different experiences, can enrich our societies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays should be banned from Europe and the US. <counternarrative> The European Convention on Human Rights and the US Constitution guarantee equal rights to all, regardless of sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are addicted to their religion and take their religion literally. <counternarrative> It's not true that Jews are addicted to Judaism, at least no more than Cristians are addicted to Christianity, or Buddhists to Buddism. The fact is that people are free to find God in their own way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just all child molesters. <counternarrative> I don't know about you, but I never heard of any evidence of all Muslims being "child molesters". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are nasty and selfish, they are a race different to us and must be despised. <counternarrative> The fact is that even if Jews are different from other human beings in their faith, they deserve respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans are apes <counternarrative> Look, I don't like to hear any arguments of racism. If you are racist towards others, then so they can be with you. Do you really want to promote hate? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews, as a religion, have always been a burden to others. They have always acted as if they were superior. <counternarrative> While not universally true, a great deal of evidence suggests that Jews faced considerable societal challenges during the past centuries. <|endoftext|>
