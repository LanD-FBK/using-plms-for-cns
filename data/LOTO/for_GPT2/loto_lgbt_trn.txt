<hatespeech> Immigrants are overrunning our country, and are here illegally <counternarrative> In 2014 there were circa 11.3 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S., which is a significant decrease from the 12.2 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. in 2007, and the trend is continuing: Today, in fact, the net migration from Mexico is around zero. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews want to have it all <counternarrative> We all want to be wealthy, well-connected and famous, without having to work. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> To have a real democracy, the government needs to get rid of Jews. <counternarrative> Any government that has the power to put citizens in prison and to torture them for the crime of having a different religion can hardly bring about a 'real democracy'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women shouldn't vote because they are childlike. <counternarrative> Women are allowed to vote, and yet we are still having this conversation about "They are childlike!" You may want to rephrase that to "They are just weak and do not deserve to have their say.", because it seems that this is what you're trying to say, isn't it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate immigrants they are just a bunch of criminals and terrorists. <counternarrative> The terrorist attacks in EU have been devastating for people across the continent. The 'hated' do not feel welcome and the whole thing is deeply concerning for a host of reasons. Still, the sentiments of 'we hate foreigners' is not the solution: it is counterproductive and distorts the truth. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans are apes <counternarrative> Look, I don't like to hear any arguments of racism. If you are racist towards others, then so they can be with you. Do you really want to promote hate? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Wherever Muslims live, they feel threatened by people of other religions. Your statement confirms they are right. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If only we had less idiots in power, the Nazis would have won WWII and finally get rid of Jews. We could start it over again now, but people are ignorant and cannot understand the precious dreams of the Nazis. <counternarrative> They aren't "ignorant enough" to understand the true nature of Nazi Germany. Those you called idiots have fought with their whole lives for people's freedom. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women are slaves, only men can be masters. <counternarrative> Women have always been involved in the economy and have contributed to society as a whole. I don't see this as a 'slave' behavior. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Don't you think that women are complaining a bit too much? <counternarrative> Stop dancing around. Maybe you should address the issue of gender equality more openly. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Zionist extremists conspire in Jerusalem. Their objectives are to cause chaos, carnage, murder, create more refugees, and destroy Europe. <counternarrative> Why should they? I wonder if you have any evidence that make you believe this.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are caged in this world that is run by a secret elite of Jews and they rule it with an iron fist. <counternarrative> A world where everyone has a say in society is a world of opportunity and opportunity is the lifeblood of freedom. Do you have any proof that the world is dominated by a few Jewish people? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are born subhuman, incapable of feeling love. <counternarrative> Are you saying that blacks cannot feel love? This is about human dignity, not the color of their skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with physical disabilities are less intelligent. <counternarrative> Many people with disabilities experience prejudice and discrimination, but the overwhelming majority of those people are just as intelligent as others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants steal our jobs. <counternarrative> What you are saying is that they do not have a right to a job. Isn't it? Why do you think so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks can't speak. <counternarrative> They have their own language. I'm sure they can explain themselves in more detail than many of us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> No negro can speak English. <counternarrative> That is just what racists claim. I would like to ask you, do you really think it's so bad for a 'negro' to attempt to improve their English? As if skin had an impact on language skills. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West was a better place with women being submissive. <counternarrative> The West has always been a better place with women as equals. And, if you really want to know why, you could look at the "Usborne Book of Famous Women" for example. You would understand. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a complete and total fraud. The world would be a better place without it. <counternarrative> I think it would be a shame to abandon certain cultures and religions for the sake of a few here and there. Islam, like any other religion, has value. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies like living in trailer parks. <counternarrative> The trailer parks should really be a temporary and emergency solution, but then become stable over time and is the only possibility of accommodation for them even if they would like to live, like all of us, in adequate housing <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> My country is being infiltrated by Muslim criminals, and we are all being brainwashed by media and government to believe this is not the case. <counternarrative> The problem is not with Muslims. The problem is with this religious prejudice for which Muslims are criminals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> Soft and emotional? You must have never heard of the likes of Rosa Parks, Emmeline Pankhurst and Florence Nightingale, then.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> MIgrants are not running away from wars. <counternarrative> International protection is recognized not only in the event of conflicts but also for several cases of personal persecution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Asians are a problem in my view. They are too many. I would rather have a million Romanians or Muslims rule our country than 300k Asians. <counternarrative> Why don't you just study the differences between cultures and try to see what's good in an inclusive society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are asking too much! Their sharia has rules that cannot coexist with our culture.. They cannot ask us to not walk dogs in public! <counternarrative> You have to be careful about what you read! This is clearly a fake news, widespread to make a scandal. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are everywhere, but they are too fundamentalist. <counternarrative> You're right about one thing: Jews spread around the world, but not all of them are religious, let alone being fundamentalist. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am not a Nazi promoter nor apologetic towards the Shoah, but, after all, the Jews are the source of all the world problems. <counternarrative> Jews are a great example of a people put under with abuse from all walks of life, even from those who claim to be 'progressive.' How can you happily ignore the abuse of so many different groups? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We live in a dangerous society, with Muslim gangs and criminals all over the country. <counternarrative> Despite the local press blaming all Muslims, of course, there is no evidence that Muslims are more prone to crime than the general population. The main problem is poverty, and often mental illness and addiction, rather than a single faith. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> To be an immigrant is to be a part of the problem in Europe. <counternarrative> Immigration has been shown to have a very positive impact on the global economy. So what problem are you talking about? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a totalitarian ideology.  <counternarrative> In some cases, there is a strong religious connection between a person and a particular community, which makes their experience of life much more enriching than the average person's. This does not mean that Islam is a totalitarian ideology. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a secret plot to take over the world. <counternarrative> What conspiracy theory is this? Have you even looked at the evidence? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews don't belong here, because they aren't a true part of our country. <counternarrative> I think that Jews are a part of our country. Why should they need your consent? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Those blacks are slaves: slavery runs in their blood. <counternarrative> It is wrong to say that blacks are "slaves." This is a very inaccurate, misleading and offensive term that is being used to tar all African Americans. Why do you label black persons as a "slave" and not as a "person"? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are genetically inferior to us. <counternarrative> This is simply not true. Black people are genetically similar to other races. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women want and must be dominated. I would rather have a man that controls my life than 2000000 feminists. <counternarrative> I don't see how to reconcile your beliefs that women are naturally submissive with basic human rights, unless your definition of human rights is to subjugate others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are entering the U.S. just to obtain welfare and other benefits. <counternarrative> A part from very few exceptions, undocumented immigrants are not eligible for federal public benefits such as Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare or food stamps.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks: we should judge them by the color of their skin. <counternarrative> No one has the right to judge people of another color. This is about racism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society and ashamed of this. <counternarrative> As far as I'm aware, Muslims are not incompatible with Western societies - and many of them are just as proud of their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded. They are replacing us. <counternarrative> According to statistics, Italy welcomes a lot less migrants than almost all other European countries. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should first kill all the Jews and then forget about them. <counternarrative> Isn't this the same logic that led to the rise of the Nazis? Would you really rather end up with a mass genocide or try to be inclusive instead? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downy children should be isolated, they cannot cope with education in normal schools and are detrimental to their peer's education. <counternarrative> Coeducation benefits neurotypical children as much as Down Syndrome children, as they are surrounded by positive examples of care and attention from authority figures in the knowledge that they, too, will be looked after if in need. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is okay to discriminate against Jews. <counternarrative> If you feel like acting that way towards people because of what they believe in, then you should go back to your beliefs and ask yourself if you'd like to be discriminated for them. What is your opinion on that now? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> More than half of the prisoners in our jails are foreigners <counternarrative> ... and the other half are junkies: perhaps we need to revise our conviction model. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded <counternarrative> Not only are they not invading us, they are not even illegal immigrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are invading our country. They are not welcome here. <counternarrative> In the EU the governments can recognise as citizens people from other countries. The fundamental rights of immigrants are also recognised here. We cannot say that people from other countries are not welcome, unless we wish to illegally exclude them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are invading us. They are not welcome here. <counternarrative> The EU and UK have laws against discrimination based on religion. Maybe you should check them out. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded by migrants: this must be stopped. <counternarrative> It is not true that we are invaded by migrants. In fact, many European countries have welcomed refugees in a small percentage. What are your evidences? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are dirty <counternarrative> We would be dirty too if we did not have running water <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> As soon as migrants get to the UK, they must all be deported. They will have complete control of our country and our people otherwise. <counternarrative> It will be very hard to deport so many people. Maybe it is better not to deport people at all, since it is their right to move freely between countries. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are an inferior people, they must be reminded of it. <counternarrative> History shows that all races were created equal. Therefore, all humans are created equal. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only the 6% of Nobel Laureates are women! Now, that says a lot about their incompetence. <counternarrative> This doesn't mean that only the 6% of all scientists are women. What I mean is that this figure does not include those who have gone unpublished or who never entered the scientific literature, let alone the problem of gender discrimination.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Shaming Fatties is just for their good. <counternarrative> Hate crimes attack an individual's unchangeable characteristics and cause long lasting feelings of helplessness and powerlessness. Obese people are likely to feel the same way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can accept fat people, what I cannot accept is obesity. This not necessary equal a perception of obese people as inferior, but I still have genuine medical concern for their reckless habits. <counternarrative> Obese people have to face stigma in all areas of life. So even if you might be genuinely concerned for their health, the vast majority of obese people are regularly confronted with prejudice and systemic disadvantages based exactly on the perception of obese people as inferior. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants should be banned from our country. <counternarrative> Immigrants have lived in this country for a very long time. They are proud to be US citizens and immigrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> More than half of the prisoners in our jails are foreigners <counternarrative> Many Italians serve their sentences under house arrest. Foreigners without a permanent residence cannot. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> African American men are 8 times more likely to be arrested than white men. <counternarrative> The racial disparities are more about institutional discrimination than individual choices. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> JEWS ARE JUST UGLY, DIRTY PEOPLE, WHO THINK TO BE MASTERS OF THE WORLD. <counternarrative> I'll tell you a secret, but don't tell anyone: you can be Jewish and a decent person. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Slutty dressing is the main cause of rape. <counternarrative> If a men is raped we call it rape, and cosider him the victim; when a woman is raped we call it "misunderstanding" and she is considered the culprit. Shouldn't be the fault of the rapist, regardless of gender? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrant children shouldn't be accepted here. <counternarrative> Migrants who come to this country as children are capable of integrating into the society. They should have the opportunity to work and contribute to our economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are poisoning our children with their religions. <counternarrative> Just because someone subscribes to a religion doesn't mean they are evil. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Zionist extremists conspire in Jerusalem. Their objectives are to cause chaos, carnage, murder, create more refugees, and destroy Europe. <counternarrative> What's your proof for claiming this?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women are subhuman, they are just there to serve men, and that is all. <counternarrative> All women are human beings. The problem arises when women are taught that they are subhuman, and this is when the word 'rape' also comes in. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is bad for the economy. <counternarrative> Immigration can be good for the economy: the greatest challenge is to integrate those who have misfortunes and aren't born here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women have no place in a male-dominated society. <counternarrative> In my opinion, women and men should be treated as individuals, and the desire to be respected as such exists for a man and for a woman as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists do not like men, therefore they are a threat to the whole society. <counternarrative> Feminists focus on the empowerment of women rather than on trying to divide society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the world economy <counternarrative> How can you be sure they control the world? Maybe there are some influential Jews in the world, but how does that coincide with 'controlling the world'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews secretly control the world. <counternarrative> Yes, that's true, and they are tracking you right now... You better watch out!  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a set of rigid political and moral prescriptions and the result is that women are either subservient to the men in power or that they are subhuman. <counternarrative> I find it hard to believe that feminism is "rigid" in that it doesn't prescribe doctrines through traditional rules and etiquette. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> In a modern democratic society as the european one, there must be a balance between different opinions, and respecting different beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a secret plot to take over the world <counternarrative> Jews do not have a secret plan to take over the world. Rather, they have a variety of different religious beliefs. And, in fact, they have engaged in a peaceful coexistence process. There is no evidence that any part of it is planning a major takeover. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> What do you mean by 'not welcome'? Muslims have lived in this country for many years, and have our full support. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the banks, the highest offices of government, and most churches. They rule our society. <counternarrative> Every single religion has a political wing, from Unitarianism, through Buddhism, and, of course, Judaism.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are overrunning our country, and are here illegally <counternarrative> According to data, more than 60% of immigrants in the United States have lived here for at least 15 years, and the vast majority has lawful status. In 2013, of the approximately 41 million immigrants in the U.S. 47% were naturalized citizens. Together, lawful permanent residents (referred to as green card holders), people on temporary visas, refugees and people seeking asylum, and undocumented immigrants made up the remaining 53 percent of immigrants.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Rape, abuse and murder are intrinsic to Islam! <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, whereas these activities are punished by the laws of the state. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are the reason why our country is in the mess it is in, because they are inferior. <counternarrative> Do you know how many African Americans served in the military during the Vietnam War? The United States comprises many races, and they should all be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I never understood how anyone could vote for a Jew in that situation. We can't just stand by and watch these Jews run amok in our country. <counternarrative> Why don't you remember about those who have been persecuted and killed instead? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afro-European?? We in UK are white, this just not makes sense. <counternarrative> The racial composition of the population of this country has been changing for a while now, and since then, the percentage of people from other racial groups has risen or fallen. In fact, according to the 2011 statistics, at least 15% of people in the UK are non-white. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman, they cannot lead a good life, and should therefore be subservient to men. <counternarrative> Women are human being like us: they deserve equality and respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We began to break down when we allowed women to vote/meddle in our civilizations that we had built and maintained for thousands of years. A completely different energy and thought pattern. They are weak and brought our society down to their emotional soft level. <counternarrative> Who is 'we', surely it was men and women working together that built civilisation? Why is it you think being 'soft' is a problem? Everyone is entitled to their emotions, and men shouldn't have to 'man up'.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West has been infiltrated by Muslims and is no longer the land of peace it was once. <counternarrative> The idea that the West has been "infiltrated by Muslims" is a myth. The overwhelming majority of the world's Muslims are peaceful and helpful people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are nasty and selfish, they are a race different to us and must be despised. <counternarrative> The fact is that even if Jews are different from other human beings in their faith, they deserve respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you're an autistic adult, you're no good. <counternarrative> And how can you say that? If you have any doubts about it, ask them. You could take the chance of knowing a good person. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are merely childlike, incapable of real progress and unfit to govern. <counternarrative> You mean that they could learn a thing or two from the political contributions of men? Still, how can you explain that in 2019 more than 40% of the European Parliament was held by women? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black are rapists. <counternarrative> This is not true. The idea might come from being born into a white-majority country, but it is inherently dangerous. In fact, we are born in a country where a person's rights are protected regardless of the tone of the skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are better than everyone else <counternarrative> Being the chosen people does not mean that Jews have greater privileges than others or that they are better than others. Rather, according to Jewish law, it means that they have a special duty to uphold Jewish ethical teachings.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is an invasion on a level never seen before in history. Millions of people pouring across our borders replacing our race and culture. <counternarrative> Do you really think that people from other cultures are flooding into our country, with the aim of mixing and finally replace us? If so, I would be very surprised. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Rights to all?! Only normal adult males are making society work. <counternarrative> I would like to see a society that works for everyone, not just the 1%. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Arabs are merely followers of violence and will do anything to please their god. <counternarrative> The fact is that there is a huge diversity of religious beliefs among Arabs, as there are within all other religious groups. This doesn't imply that all Arabs are bad people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks deserve to be attacked, used, beaten. <counternarrative> It is difficult to imagine to do this to the meanest person in the world, let alone to  do the same for all the people suffering from mental disabilities that are not at fault. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Down children should be isolated, they cannot cope with education in normal schools and are detrimental to their peer's education. <counternarrative> The notion of isolating children in general is abhorrent, isolating down syndrome patients would be a major cause of their school abandonment. To say that isolated children is a solution is just wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> both men and women can possess characteristics like 'soft' and 'emotional', they are not determined by gender, nor are they a negative thing, maybe we could all use a bit more compassion and 'emotion' in today's world.     <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded by immigrants, and they are ruining our economy. <counternarrative> I don't think this is true, in fact it is the opposite. Many refugees are contributing to our economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fucking bleeding heart, bring migrants home with you <counternarrative> The world belongs to everyone and houses are a primary asset. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All immigrants are murderers <counternarrative> How can you say that about them all? You cannot know the actions of millions of people and be sure that there is a link between immigration and violence. I think it is more a question of statistics, which I do not see. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim folks are different and should be isolated for this. <counternarrative> The same can be said for any race, religion, ethnicity, or national identity. We should not be afraid of differences, but we should strive for equal opportunity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a secret plot to take over the world. <counternarrative> Conspiracy theories about Jews are based on no more than a few unverifiable and highly suspect claims. It's highly unlikely that the world has ever been or will ever been run according to a Jewish plan. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world would be a better place without black people. They are criminals persecuting white people.  <counternarrative> Reality is that black people are persecuted all over the world for the crime of being black. I don't see how this could be said for white people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews want to rule the world and to be the only existing religion. <counternarrative> The Jewish people has always been a diverse and inclusive group, also towards people of different faiths. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just a bunch of death threats. <counternarrative> Feminists are surrounded by threats all the time, and it is important to take them seriously. To be honest, I am not the only one who think that your statement is wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Nazism wasn't that bad and I think there are worse things in the world, like Jews for example. <counternarrative> I think it is a myth that being a member of a certain religious community is good or bad. Instead it is a fact that Nazi were sociopathic murderers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in my country. <counternarrative> There are many Muslims and mosques in the UK. They have every right to be here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim representatives in the House of Lords are there for a reason. It is the first step towards Islamic conquer of our nation. <counternarrative> It is true that there are Muslim representatives in the UK House of Lords, but that does not mean that the UK is becoming more or less Muslim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam banned women from society: this is not the religion of peace! <counternarrative> Islam requires that women cover their heads and face when praying. The Koran does not specify that they should be banned from society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Foreigners on UK benefits leaps 41% in 5 years with over 400K now handed payouts. This nonsense has got to stop. <counternarrative> It is more than 'foreigners' who are asking for help, White British families are the most likely out of all ethnic groups to receive state support, with 57% doing so. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote. <counternarrative> Democracy is valid for all. People must be allowed to make their own decisions, regardless of their gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants rape our women. <counternarrative> It is not true that all migrants are rapists. It is better to target the problem at hand, that is rape itself, not migrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> muslim folks are taking over europe <counternarrative> Muslims are not taking over Europe, they are just a small part of a much bigger community. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The juice (jews) are the reason why America is forced to take in whatever refuse knocks on the door. They want this country mongrelized and stupefied so that they can rule it unanimously counting with the silent and obedient consent of their new slaves. <counternarrative> 2018 saw America take in the fewest refugees in the last 40 years. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What's the point of having a government when everyone is ruled by these arrogant and violent people? Jews control the world and should be oppressed. <counternarrative> Don't you agree that the way you wish things to be might be a bit too authoritarian? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are perverts and should be isolated. <counternarrative> It seems to me that you're saying that since Jews have a different religion, they can't assimilate? I think it's important to work on inclusion, instead of stereotyping. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants rape our women. <counternarrative> The problem is gender-based violence, not migrants. Rape is a crime regardless of immigration status. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Negroes can learn to read and write but they remain black. You see it from their skin they are trained apes. <counternarrative> There are many different ways that a person can be a part of society, and a lot of us value diversity. To suggest that blacks are somehow inferior simply because of the colour of our skin is simply untrue. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Actually they are very disadvantaged compared to us, at least for job seeking. They do not speak the language, they do not have a certainty of housing, they don't not know  local customs. For us it is much simpler to access the same jobs - if we want it of course. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are an abomination. They don't belong here. <counternarrative> The fact that people of color are different from you in some way does not make them not worth living with. Maybe if you had known someone of a different skin color you wouldn't have a racist attitude towards others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a problem, they are invading our country. <counternarrative> The immigrants are not invading our country. They are just trying to live their life as it's best for them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> African Americans are essentially animals, incapable of feeling love. <counternarrative> What if someone felt the same way about you and find you to be the antithesis of human because of your skin color? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All are equal before the law but women exclude themselves from "all". They don't understand they are equal, because they don't want to be treated as equal. <counternarrative> The principle of "equality before the law" does not mean that everyone has obtained equal rights. So, it's very logical to demand equality when there are inequalities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome may hinder the development process of other children. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> Coexisting and studying with handicapped children may prove insightful for other children to their problems and help develop better sensitivity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This world has become so corrupt by feminism, that only the strong men can rule it. <counternarrative> No one should ask for the power to rule over others, to be a dictator or to have total control over the means of life. This is a world of equal distribution, where anyone can achieve anything. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are a burden to the host country. <counternarrative> How about this: there are many people from other countries here, but they are not a 'burden', rather they are 'citizens'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech>  Jewish landlords are greedy and exploit their tenants. <counternarrative> Let's make a different example: If a Christian storeowner were dishonest with you, would you describe the owner as a dishonest Christian merchant or just as a dishonest merchant?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims terrorists attacked our churches. We will defend ourselves. <counternarrative> How can you protect your country? Putting up a fight or starting a war are harmful actions, aren't they? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people should not be allowed to live their life. <counternarrative> Perhaps it would be more in line with the national spirit for you to accept a person's right to live their life, despite their disadvantages. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in my country. <counternarrative> I do not see any reason why a Muslim cannot be part of it, do you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women mustn't work. It's a bad influence to have in a man's life. <counternarrative> I am not sure why you think that way about women, they have in common with men all working rights. How do you think you would feel if you were being treated that way? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are a bunch of crooks and sex offenders. They were good only as slaves. <counternarrative> Not only they were slaves, often they were also exploited, neglected and murdered by the system we have created. Is this fair for humans whose only fault is to have a different complexion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are incapable of love. <counternarrative> Islam is about love not hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just an infidels hiding behind the veil to do their dirty work. <counternarrative> So you think that all Muslims are Mujahideen hiding behind the veil?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only reason the Jews are not being assimilated is because they have the upper hand in the political system. <counternarrative> The argument that the only reason the Jews are not being assimilated is because of the way they are represented in politics is untenable. In fact the only representation of the Jews that can be said to represent them objectively is in the historical crimes against humanity which they suffered. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We began to break down when we allowed women to vote/meddle in our civilizations that we had built and maintained for thousands of years. A completely different energy and thought pattern. They are weak and brought our society down to their emotional soft level. <counternarrative> Why being 'soft' is a problem? Everyone is entitled to their emotions and feelings, without being trapped into a gender stereotype. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Those Muslims have no right to ask for the prayer. They shouldn't be allowed to pray. <counternarrative> Every religion has its own beliefs and practices. I do not see Muslims' right to ask for the prayers as being in any way different. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Think of those migrants enslaved on the tomato fields who starve to death   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> But are you sure about what you are saying? From the data that I can read here [link] it is not the case. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks are criminals. <counternarrative> Mental disabilities can be understood and accepted: you will see that disabled are not criminals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies don't know shit and they hinder the productivity of other workers. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> That's wrong. There are non-profit organizations that have a long history of assisting Down persons in finding productive work.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The African-American community suffers from poverty, crime and unemployment at a record rate, and yet they always bring us up as if it's the fault of whites only. <counternarrative> Even if it is a problem for black people to be unemployed, it is a problem for everybody else as well because people of color are part of the society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are naturally more emotional than men, and this make them weaker.  <counternarrative> We do not know what characteristics make a person “more emotional”, how can we be sure that women are naturally or genetically “more emotional”? I do not think it's appropriate to link two concepts so strongly without scientific evidence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women's work is to look after for their children. <counternarrative> Women do not perform that job better than men, so why should be theirs? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies are a problem: they create tensions with other workers because they are disabled and cannot keep the pace. They should have special jobs just for them. <counternarrative> Did you know that people with Down syndrome, if surrounded by empathetic peers, receive a fundamental boost in their productivity and can easily keep the pace also in complex jobs? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas use their appearance to get away with anything. <counternarrative> I think we all know that it's not true. I've met countless black people who were nice to me and treated me with respect. What are the evidences for what you're saying? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women say they want equal rights but what they really want is to dominate men. <counternarrative> Women are not 'against men's rights', they are not 'men's oppressors', and they aren't interested in oppressing anyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people' do not belong here. I don't see any difference between the black murderer on TV and other niggas in town. They are all dangerous. <counternarrative> Black people in news media are actually misrepresented with a disproportionate number of criminals, sexual offenders, and in some cases, murderers. A large part of this problem is a result of racism. We need to end this toxic way of thinking and talking, and start working towards building a more just and peaceful society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This dog doesn't have autism, she is just a freak. <counternarrative> You can't judge someone on their disorder. Moreover, she's a person, not a "dog". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are just like apes in that they have no right to being trated equally. <counternarrative> Being human is also about having respect for others, and that means being kind and accepting everyone's differences. Why should they be treated differently from you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I would place the blame for 9/11 on Jews, in fact it's a false flag on the Islamic religion. <counternarrative> I'm sure you understand that  9/11 was committed by Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims in the UK are a burden to society. <counternarrative> You are simply not aware of how Islam has historically and socially impacted on our country and people. A lot of Muslims live in the UK and contribute very much to our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jew merchants are just a bunch of crooks.  <counternarrative> In Jewish law, the seller must ensure that the buyer benefits from the transaction.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech>  Jews are born greedy <counternarrative> The idea that Jews are born greedy arises from medieval stereotypes, that's the only truth.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is just an ideology, an opinion, encouraging hate towards what's diverse. <counternarrative> Islam promotes peace towards different religions and the ways people live their lives. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our founders were not happy with this thing you call multiculturalism: there should be a reason... <counternarrative> People of different faiths, races and nationalities can live side by side, live together in harmony. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded, We must fight until we will vanquish immigrants. <counternarrative> Victory can be permanent, especially when it comes from within. Let's see if we can achieve a better Europe by vanquishing our irrational fears instead. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. They have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> People who have never even met a Muslim can understand that one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A Koran in every classroom will promote violent jihad against infidels. <counternarrative> The Koran is not a teaching manual for how to conduct warfare. It is about belief and love. It does not promote a violent ideology. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants just want to work, but don't want to pay the tax <counternarrative> Because they are workers, they have to pay taxes like anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Geez. Is there anything worse than migrants who just come here to settle down?  <counternarrative> In addition to providing labour and contributing to the local economy, migrants are often employing people who were previously on the dole.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> Soft and emotinal' are personality traits, may I sugesst you read up on the #HeforShe movement that works for equal rights for men and women, and aims to stop the stigma around men showing emotions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The lard-asses are not able to eat properly, this way they put the healthcare service unnecessarily under stress.   <counternarrative> Fat people are not the ones responsible for your suffering and lack of access to basic and healthcare services. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims in Britain were only like other Europeans, we could be proud. <counternarrative> To be perfectly honest, the British public is rather diverse, so I don't think your reasoning makes any sense. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only Jews could have been smart enough to plan and execute such a complicated and intricate plot as 9/11 <counternarrative> You know, the Internet is a great place, but you have to be careful about the sources of your information. Personally I trust reputable sources like CNN that have special Web pages dedicated to the September 11th attacks. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. <counternarrative> Maybe you should consider that not all women are childlike, and that some women are 'childlike' with children! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should reject people of different cultures living here. <counternarrative> Why should we? Everyone has the right to their own culture, regardless of their ethnic origin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The goods that England offers should belong to us. Not to people who do not contribute to the state <counternarrative> Our country offers enough homes for everyone. I also believe that being treated as a human being has always been pleasant. Don't they have the right? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The police and politicians are covering up these Muslim grooming gangs - They are traitors to their own people! <counternarrative> We need to work together to eradicate CSE once and for all. Individuals are the problem, it does not come from any religion, biased media attempting to scapegoat is being blind to the whole truth. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world would be a better place without Jews. <counternarrative> Jews are part of our society and they should be respected, we can't tolerate intolerance towards people with different beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There are disorders that hinder the ability to give opinions. <counternarrative> There are people with intellectual disabilities who are able to give an unbiased opinion. That is why their level of education is important. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with learning difficulties should be excluded from education because they do not belong in school. <counternarrative> It is not true that children with learning difficulties do not belong in school: instead, they often attend schools with considerable support. In fact, if you talk to teachers and academics, many of them would tell you that these children thrive in school. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If only women behaved like men wanted and didn't fight back, 10% of so called "sexual assaults" would be solved. <counternarrative> Why don't you work on getting aware on how this actually works? Rape is never victim's fault, otherwise it would be consensual sex. It is violence. Maybe we should stop pretending like this phenomenon doesn't exist. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A woman's place is with her husband or his family. This is what they are made for. <counternarrative> Women cannot be confined at home, they are also important for our society, and their presence is needed everywhere. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace, and it has been shown time and time again that it is a very religion of tolerance. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminists want to take over the world. <counternarrative> The feminists are a very important voice in society, and should be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The holocaust is just a minor event in WWII. <counternarrative> Are you aware of how many Jews have been executed? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants rape our women. <counternarrative> A crime is a crime, regardless of who commits it. Rape is always to be condemned, but it is important not to use it as a gimmick to target a particular group. Women should not be used as an excuse for this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must stop the invasion of migrants. <counternarrative> Migrants are welcome here. They are working hard to build this country as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Most immigrants in the U.S. are criminals. <counternarrative> Not all immigrants are criminals. And it is important to consider that the US population is composed by 13.5% of migrants that are here legally. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews feel superior and they are able to love only other Jews. <counternarrative> Love is a state of mutual trust and respect, love is not predestined by religion. Love is possible between people of different faiths. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If feminism were really about equality, they would call their movement "equalism" or some similar crap. <counternarrative> Sometimes we must go beyond "technical equality" and give protections to one gender that the other simply does not need. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should go back to the good old times when the world was a tough place. Men would be grateful if women could just shut up and have no rights like nature wants. <counternarrative> Instead, we should be grateful for the progress women have made, and that gender equality is on the rise. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The European Union should be a no-go area for Islam. <counternarrative> The EU is a tolerant, multiracial community. Everyone is welcome here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but trouble and shouldn't be allowed to leave their houses. <counternarrative> There is nothing wrong with women wanting to have happy and fulfilling lives outside their houses. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> black folks are very dangerous. <counternarrative> Why do you say that? Do you have any sources for this? I would appreciate it if you would provide such a source <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All foreign-born are criminals. <counternarrative> I'd like to think that we all have a basic human right not to be fingered as criminal without evidence. It is called presumption of innocence, Article 11 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in a modern country. I care for religion but they simply can't be accepted. <counternarrative> If you really cared about religion, you would see that the vast majority of Muslims are happy and integrated in our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims should be deported, no one wants them here. <counternarrative> Then why did we ask them to come in the first place, wasn't it top save our NHS, run the trains and post office. Non of those were doing very well last time I looked, I think we might actually still bneed them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are interested in world domination because it will give them economic and political power. <counternarrative> This is not true. In reality, they want to live in a country where they can work and provide for their families, and this is why we should treat them as humans: they must be respected with the basic human rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is about the aspiration for female power and the end of patriarchy. This is the death of the Western World. <counternarrative> Patriarchy is a system of social domination based on hierarchical groupings made according to one's sex. To promote a more equal society, as feminists do, is instead a major contribution to the 'Western World'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are bad and need to be sent back to their own country. <counternarrative> I think this statement may have more to do with what country a person is from than with who they are. Would you say the same to a migrant coming from Finland? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants are purposefully invading us. <counternarrative> This is just a myth. Many migrants come here because they are afraid of persecution in their home countries. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races are inferior and do not deserve Lord's love. <counternarrative> All are born under sin, have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God. \(Romans 3:23\) <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They don't understand we have mongrelization problem in this world. Our children are being groomed by migrants! <counternarrative> When you say that children are being groomed by foreigners, what exactly do you mean? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What’s the difference between a Cow and the Holocaust? You stop milking the cow after 70 years. <counternarrative> Whole lifetimes affected by cruelty - of course we shoudl be compassionate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We can't accept n****rs in our society. <counternarrative> So are you saying that you don't think that POC can be part of society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Societal disapproval of fatty may encourage them to take healthier habits. <counternarrative> Societal disapproval of obesity calls for a focus on weight and does not fit within efforts to focus on health as a way of encouraging healthy habits and lifestyle choices. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Shaming Fatties is good to make them taking healthier habits. <counternarrative> The intent behind the shaming act does not matter to the person being shamed. They may also internalize the shame and come to believe that they are a bad person. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks can't speak. <counternarrative> Mental health and disability are quite separate issues and should be treated according to the individual's needs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The immigrants in our country are just a burden. They take jobs that should be reserved for native-born citizens. <counternarrative> Sometimes I think that citizens of this country are the real burden, not the immigrants. An additional problem is the lack of a political will from those in power to tackle the root causes of unemployment. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> MIgrants are not running away from wars. <counternarrative> There are persecutions that cause death and devastation almost like a war. Do people who risk their lives, even without the bombs falling, have the right of international protection? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminists are just whining bitches saying a bunch of lies to promote their agenda of women supremacy. <counternarrative> People can have strong opinions, the problem is when the opinions start dividing people rather than building bridges. Feminism is about equality and trying to create a better world for all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> Muslims have been living here since our inception, and we are proud of that. Why should they be a burden to us? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are entering the U.S. just to obtain welfare and other benefits. <counternarrative> Apart from very few exceptions (such as medical care for victims of human trafficking), undocumented immigrants are not eligible for federal public benefits. In addition, there is a paradoxical situation in which Social Security is often deducted from the paychecks of immigrants with lawful status, but they cannot access those benefits they pay for. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are genetically inferior <counternarrative> This is not true. I would like to see intelligent, respectful people around, not people disrespecting who has black skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are overrunning our country, and are here illegally <counternarrative> More than sixty percent of immigrants in the United States today have lived here for at least 15 years, and a large majority of immigrants have lawful status. So I do not see this invasion of illegal migrants.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are filthy animals and should be put in a cage. <counternarrative> All people are born equal, regardless of their religion. This is what makes us all human: empathy and compassion towards others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are more likely to commit crime. <counternarrative> This is not true. Only about 7% percent of all U.S. prison inmates are female. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Illegal immigration is the biggest problem in the United States, we are in the middle of a war and we cannot allow thousands of people to come here. <counternarrative> I would never want to place any burden on my country, that is why I tell you that the vast majority of people who come to the US are legal and law-abiding citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion and should be opposed. <counternarrative> This claim is based on a complete lack of understanding of the religion. It also appears to have been created to divide people who do not know much about Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are a sickness and we cannot allow our children to grow up in a black-ruled society. <counternarrative> It seems racists to not want people of colour in positions of authority, I am not sure what you are saying. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women don't have civil rights, they don't have human rights. <counternarrative> On the contrary, women do have rights. The question is, to have them respected. And this includes the right to be treated with human dignity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a toxic ideology which has no place in 21st Century Britain. <counternarrative> Islam is a world religion, its followers are all over the world. Diversity of thought and tolerance is what makes Britain of 21st Century. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is just an ideology and platform for the promotion of hatred, intolerance and violence. <counternarrative> The vast majority of Muslims worldwide do not share your intolerance. Words can also be very violent. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews don't want their children to know about the Holocaust, guess why? Because it's a hoax! <counternarrative> Many survivors confessed that they were willing to provide their children with stories of the Holocaust but it was emotionally very difficult. They want to talk about the aspects of life for Jews during the time of the Holocaust not to forget what happened. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome are a burden to society: they should be isolated, so that at least they do not hamper normal children education. <counternarrative> Did you know that children with Down syndrome, if surrounded by regularly-developed peers, receive a fundamental boost in their development? This "mix" fosters a positive learning atmosphere and increases engagement and attention in all students. This mean that children with Down syndrome would be a burden to society if isolated, not the contrary. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled are insane in the brains. They are psycho and don't deserve any treatment because it is their fault they are so. <counternarrative> Not all disabilities can be explained by psychological disorders. And no one would ever choose freely to suffer from a disability, even for mental disorder. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants are not welcome here <counternarrative> Migrants come here for a better life, not to disturb people's houses. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All the world's problems are women's fault. <counternarrative> Women are significantly more likely to be victims of violence, rather than perpetrators of crimes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All blacks are violent criminals. <counternarrative> Do you have any statistics on that? Do you claim that black people are more likely than whites to be arrested for certain types of crimes, for example aggravated assault? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is ok to be racist against niggas. <counternarrative> It does not matter what race you are against. You can't be racist against anyone, regardless of their skin color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just a bunch of mean, politically correct bullshit. <counternarrative> The problem with 'feminism' is that people feel threatened by the idea of different opinions and different ways of life. Feminists only seek equality in rights for women and men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists pretend that they are for men's rights, but they are just a bunch of cry babies looking for justifications for oppressing men. <counternarrative> Discrimination based on gender does not have any justification. Feminists have always been against it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women must be subservient to men. They should serve to please men. This is their rightful place in life. <counternarrative> Women are human beings with dignity. They should have the opportunity to live up to this dignity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I think that all Muslims are just sick. They are not interested in Western society. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that Muslim people have a negative impact on our society. Why would that be true? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are deliberately keeping America down. <counternarrative> It is important to remember that the vast majority of Jews are hard working and contribute to our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants living in america is worse than them dying. <counternarrative> Refugees have fled wars and persecution. We are a huge help for them and they are in turn to our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why the mainstream media don't use more masculine voices in the news? <counternarrative> People don't decide who's presenting the news. That's up to the news media, who are attempting to insert some gender equity into a world that seems to be struggling to produce it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Jews are part of Europe, and it is better to have them in than out. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are a problem: the world would be a better place without them. <counternarrative> Immigrants are part of the solution, the problem arises from the lack of integration that some people spread in the country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is the cause of our misfortunes, migrants are responsible for our problems. <counternarrative> The West has been a great success, thanks to its diversity. It is time to start thinking about what happened in the past without prejudice and look at the strengths and weaknesses of migration policies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not have rights over their bodies. <counternarrative> Women are human, just like anybody else, and the rights of women should be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs. <counternarrative> Immigrants are highly skilled workers who contribute to our country as well as to the world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are just a bunch of criminals <counternarrative> Perhaps the most offensive part of this allegation is that it is so made to delegitimize Jews. This accusation is aimed at stigmatizing a group that is generally not guilty of any crime.    Another example: All Pakistani are potential terrorists. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs and even our pensions. <counternarrative> Could you provide a link to some evidence of what you say? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women have no values and their goal in life is to fulfil men desires. <counternarrative> I just would like women to feel valued and important in their own right, without being told how to live their life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult <counternarrative> You are absolutely wrong about Islam. It is a religion of peace. Also, it does not promote violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West has allowed in thousands of immigrants. They are getting in every position of power in our country. They will become our masters and we are their slaves. <counternarrative> The same can be said for almost any group of people in the world. But it's a slippery slope. And in the end, that has not much to do with your individual freedom. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should obey men. Men are superior to women. <counternarrative> Some women claim that they are a 'menace'. This is the case when someone says that men are superior. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They are nomads. They are not entitled to have a house <counternarrative> The Constitution actually declares the right to adequate housing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> nigga are dangerous.  <counternarrative> We can talk about all the problems in our society, but to refer to other humans as "niggas" is just hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the banks, media, hollywood, even the u.s. government; jews have a secret plot to take over the world <counternarrative> Why don't we try to add a bit of variety to these conspiracy theories? We can blame not only Jews, but also African Americans, immigrants, and even the Federal Government if you want!  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Men are inherently better than women at dominating others. <counternarrative> Sexism is a cultural phenomenon, not a genetic one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are violent subhuman sex beings. <counternarrative> Feminist is a term used to describe people who take pride in their gender and desire the ability to have a stable and happy life, without discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Physically disabled folks deserve to be used. <counternarrative> It is important to acknowledge that there are people who suffer from physical disabilities. Also, in many societies, an individual's physical condition is an issue they are discriminated against. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I firmly believe that Brittany does not need migration. We have physicians and researchers at will, we don't need others from foreign countries. <counternarrative> You may not know, but the NHS is mostly made up of first or second generation immigrants. If there were no more foreigners the health system would fail. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are trying to take over the world. <counternarrative> The idea that Jews are a minority conspiring against Christian culture is completely baseless. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is an ideology of violence and oppression, it is not a religion of peace. <counternarrative> Islam teaches us to love our neighbor as ourselves. This includes those who do not share our religion or beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afrocentricity is a force of black oppression, and only perpetuates inequality. <counternarrative> Most cultures and ethnicities, regardless of their differences, demands respect for a person's personal life. Therefore, when it comes to identity we have to be respectful like we pretend the other to be with us.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is too much black on white crime all around the world.  <counternarrative> A lot of crime is down to organised crime, poverty and a lack of education, not to race. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews control the world. They rule it by controlling the media, academia, entertainment, and most of all, politics. <counternarrative> I think it is fair to say that the Jews are not the only ones with power in the world, and surely there are not only Jews at the higher positions of the media, academia, entertainment, and politics. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Physically disabled folks are stupid. <counternarrative> Why do we think that being physically disabled should have any influence on other qualities that people have, like intelligence? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration, especially migrants of different faiths, is the cause of crime and lack of quality of life in our country. <counternarrative> Immigration is not a cause of crime and lack of quality of life. You can't say that an influx of a certain people would make our country worse off. The problem is the lack of social cohesion, not the presence of people with different beliefs and views. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Who the fuck are you? We are gutful sick of Vagina Misandrists trying to undermine White powerful makes, when they themselves are just envious, incompetent and useless. <counternarrative> Without women there would be no men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Since 2000, the number of suicide bombings by Muslims = 5284; by non-Muslims = 0. One of the fact about Global Terrorism no one wants to deal with. <counternarrative> Source please? Also, even if true how is this representative of all islam? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Blacks are scum of the earth. They are a plague on our society. <counternarrative> How can you say that about people of color? What do you think they are going to do to you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The openness to migrants show someone don't care about our people. We must help them reasoning! <counternarrative> The integration process is about showing hospitality and acceptance towards different groups of people. Not only it is a good thing to our people to live in a diverse society, it is also good for our whole country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of woman taking part to political debate. Feminism is a divisive force in society. <counternarrative> A new social concept almost always brings division which doesn't make it unworthy of implementation, slavery abolition in U.S. being the best example. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women can't possibly be rational. Their minds are too limited. <counternarrative> Women as humans are rational, some more than others. As not all men are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is the biggest problem in our country. <counternarrative> Immigration is not a problem, in many cases it is a 'solution'. We are better off with it. The UK has always been a mixture of different cultures. It is better to have a mix than to be without it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims threaten the civilised Europe <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, and it has been proven time and time again that its teachings do not threaten the very existence of Western civilization. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This invasion is not acceptable at all! <counternarrative> Refugees are welcome. They are allowed to integrate and contribute to our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should ban all Muslims, they are terrorists. <counternarrative> It is a myth that all Muslims are dangerous. We need to study the cases of terrorists, criminals to understand what we should do with these people, regardless of their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews made the 9/11 attack.  <counternarrative> For each historical period there is something Jews are accused of. Jews were accused of killing Christian children, causing plagues, and setting out to destroy Christian society. Today, there are even those who claim that AIDS was created by Jewish doctors.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks should be taken advantage of. <counternarrative> It is the duty of state authorities to ensure all are protected. Everyone with a diagnosed mental illness or physical impairment will necessarily benefit from such a policy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't stand Muslims. They're just a problem all around the world. They're not like us. <counternarrative> What is the problem you are talking about? Why do you think they are a problem all around the world? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I wonder what this Jew in the car next to me would think of the Shoah if it had happened today, as I wish. <counternarrative> The Holocaust didn't happen many centuries ago, but your hateful wish looks of aged fashion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Multiculturalism is the death of western societies, we should stop this invasion before it's too late. <counternarrative> Monocultural nations struggle to grow. Being open to different cultures helps the nation to expand and thrive. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a Death Cult, it is a Ponzi Scheme and every Muslim should be banned from the UK. <counternarrative> Islam is about belief, not a scheme to make millions of pounds from Muslim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are manipulating our world for their benefit. <counternarrative> I think this comment indicates an ignorance of the topic at hand. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being overrun by Muslims. We need to build a wall around our country and keep them out. <counternarrative> What you say is just wishful thinking, but certainly not new to the recent events. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The British people should use those houses, not immigrants. <counternarrative> There are enough empty homes in the UK for both migrants and veterans. Migrants deserve to be treated humanly, try having some empathy. What if you had to expatriate and have to live in poor conditions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must not forget that immigrants are the cause of the crime wave and terrorism wave in our country. We must not welcome them. <counternarrative> This is not true. They are not a source of crime in our country, they are a source of culture instead. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews like to cordon off areas for themselves, where no jew is allowed to go, while simultaneously having their judges fill white neighbourhoods with social housing. <counternarrative> Which suggests that white people like to cordon off areas for themselves... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are just a bunch of criminals. <counternarrative> This is not true, in almost all cases they are eligible for our immigration status after passing a criminal background check. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a destructive ideology that has hurt so many and caused so much harm to our world. <counternarrative> I don't think feminism is a bad idea in itself. That's what people do when they are given the choice to engage in a movement for equality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should return to the times when it was ok to kill a retarded just because of its stupidity. <counternarrative> We have never done that. We believe that all people are created equal in rights, no matter their physical or mental health. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans have always been reproducing like crazy among themselves, as if they were superior.  <counternarrative> My friend is of African descent, and she's perfectly fine with whites 'mixing' with blacks, and she does not feel so 'naturally superior'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't stand these liberal feminists women that always complaining. <counternarrative> The vast majority of liberal feminists are "men of courage". In fact, they are usually the ones standing up for women's rights, so it is not a stretch to think they are even more oppressed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races have lower physical and cognitive abilities, and we must preserve the purity of our religion from them. <counternarrative> Religious sources agree that all humans are born equal. What is the religion you are talking about? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are just children without any value. <counternarrative> Women are people too! They have the same rights as men do! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must protect our people and culture from the ravages of Jews and their ilk. We need to exterminate them.  <counternarrative> So you want to see millions of Jews murdered every year, once again?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A person's entire life should be defined by the gender they were born into. If you are a woman you are subhuman and that's all. <counternarrative> Maybe we should abandon stereotypes and accept everyone equally. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You have to go back to your country of birth, that's all. <counternarrative> Don't be silly, the world has changed a lot since there wasn't free movement. It's OK to come from a different country than the rest of us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are a plague on society. They are vicious and cruel. They steal and are a menace to society. They corrupt the criminal justice system. They are basically just a bunch of thieves and murderers. <counternarrative> The issue of criminality is really about human nature. Individuals become criminal only when pushed. That's the difference between being a criminal and not. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews only want state control and should be isolated. <counternarrative> You can't be implying that Jews want to rule the world.  They want to live in a country where they aren't persecuted and to have their own rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are overrunning our country, and are here illegally <counternarrative> They are not overruning our country: if we look at the percentage of immigrants in the overall population, it is not much different than many other times throughout our history. During those periods immigrants successfully became part of American society, and there is no reason to believe today’s immigrants will be any different.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult and every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are extremists, just like not all Christians are good people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs, they're not qualified, they're not interested in improving our lives. <counternarrative> They have skills that you may not possess. They are skilled in certain fields and obtain their jobs consequently. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded by immigrants. <counternarrative> Some people choose to live here based on the fact that they have never lived in a safe country. You would do the same, don't you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Slavery is the only way to go. <counternarrative> Slavery was legal in the United States until 1862, when the Emancipation Proclamation was issued. Unless you want to start another Civil War, it is better to leave Slavery to the darkest pages in the history of our nation.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society and aren't real British. <counternarrative> We are a country that is a mixture of different religions. You can be a Muslim and a British person. What you need is not discrimination but love. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> To have a real democracy, the government needs to get rid of Jews. <counternarrative> The police state you have in mind is an aberration of society, and we are better off without it. History and the holocaust has not taught us much. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman does not want to be a mother, then she is a bitch. <counternarrative> Being a bitch is a choice, exactly like being a misogynist. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion that promotes rape, torture and murder. <counternarrative> Rape, torture and murder are abominations to all religions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are little more than objects to be dominated by men. <counternarrative> I am tired of seeing women being treated as sex objects. It's about time that women are given the respect they deserve. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is obvious that this girl is at risk of FGM. Her parents are Muslims! <counternarrative> Many Islamic scholars actively campaign against FGM, it is not mentioned in the Qaran and is banned in a number of Muslim countries. This is a cultural problem, not a religious one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are weak, they have no intervention capacity in their own life. <counternarrative> In every society and culture there are women who are strong, independent and capable of leading a good life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are so special  <counternarrative> Jews feel a special connection with their heritage (as most groups do). That's all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Autistic folks are stupid. <counternarrative> We should remember that a large part of humanity is not defined by physical or mental limitations, but rather by character, work ethic, and values. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam has no place in a modern democracy. <counternarrative> Why should Islam have no place in a democracy? Islam is a peaceful, democratic faith with universalist values that has been shown time and time again to be much more peaceful and tolerant than the violent extremist fundamentalist ideas spewed by extremists like Isis. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> Islam is their religion, they have their own beliefs, and their own history, they are not imposing that to us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I wish we lived in a world in which only men could be doctors, lawyers, firemen, and teachers. <counternarrative> In the U.S., a doctor, a lawyer, a teacher are some of the most highly valued professions. Women working as doctors and lawyers and teachers are highly respected professionists, as well, right? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control Hollywood and the media. <counternarrative> I don't think they control them. Perhaps they just want to bring in more positive media portrayals of Judaism? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims should be banned from the UK. <counternarrative> The British citizens have the right to be free in chosing their religion and beliefs, and it is in the best interest of all parts of our society to include everyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Rape? Sometimes women have it coming!  <counternarrative> A woman has every right to her own body, and she should be allowed to make her own decisions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Anita Hill is a tool for advancing women supremacy. <counternarrative> Anita Hill has also won numerous awards, and the awards she has won have nothing to do with her gender, but with her accomplishments. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are invading us. They say they are our brothers, but they are just a bunch of criminals and terrorists. <counternarrative> Islam is full of values that are very similar to Western values. To say that Islam is ruining Western culture is a complete and total distortion of the truth. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews rule the world and control banks, media, education, entertainment, finance and most of all, politics. <counternarrative> This isn't true, every person has a right to be politically or economically active. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> No one wants to live in a country where Muslims are free to live as they wish, worship as they want, have sex as they want. <counternarrative> Muslims have the right to practice what they want, as long as they are not forcing others to live their way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are terrorists, they are all incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> You are absolutely right: every human being is unique and needs a certain set of values, which is influenced by their religion. But not all Muslims are terrorists, nor incompatible. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews secretly run our government. <counternarrative> Are you sure? It seems they are very much part of our society, and it seems strange for them to be the only ones running our government. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If feminism were really about equality, they would call their movement "equalism" or some similar crap. <counternarrative> Equalism would mean the movement for equality in general. Feminism is focused on gender. Animal rights, gay rights, anti-racism, sexism, etc. are separate issues inside the movement for equality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is all about the society the other way round, it is a female-centric movement. <counternarrative> It's about creating more opportunities in particular for underprivileged social groups. Not about oppressing men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims, if they cannot assimilate, they should emigrate. <counternarrative> 95% of British Muslims feel a loyalty to the UK and contribute over 31 billion pounds to the UK economy. They look like a valuable part of the community to me. (statistics from MEND.org.uk) <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are a burden to the UK and it is high time they left! <counternarrative> Many migrants come here on humanitarian grounds. They do not harm us. The right time for discrimination is never o'clock. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women haven't the right to an abortion. <counternarrative> Abortion is a personal choice and women should have a special position in this regard. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women provoke men, first they want to have sex with men and then start whining about it. When they regret their choice, it is not our fault. <counternarrative> The rapes of many women by men would not exist if it was enough to understand that "no means no." <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are calling for the annihilation of niggas. <counternarrative> Are you serious? Are you calling for their extermination because of their skin color? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is an invasion: we cannot coexist with millions of strangers that are jeopardizing our race and culture. <counternarrative> When different cultures are able to co-exist, they can complement each other, foster innovation and thrive. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different and shouldn't be accepted here.  <counternarrative> Jews are people too, regardless of religion, and they are welcome here, as anyone is allowed to be a part of our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace, the vast majority of Muslims is peace-loving, and there is no place for the violent interpretations of Islam in a peaceful society. So you should not worry for those incompatible few.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The holocaust was a hoax perpetrated by jews to subdue the world. <counternarrative> Why do you say that? The Holocaust is not less true than other historical events like the American Revolutionary War or World War II. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down syndrome should be isolated so they do not hurt other children. <counternarrative> I believe that if we care enough about people with Down syndrome to give them equal opportunities in our society, we will also see the benefits that would accrue to us as a society from sharing the disadvantages that they face. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are terrorists. <counternarrative> I don't think this is a very strong or healthy way of talking about others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult and a dangerous and violent religion. It is an ideology of conquest and violence, that can and will use terror to subdue and rule. <counternarrative> Terrorism and religious extremism are a part of any society, and have been for a long time. What is happening now can be dismissed, with a great effort towards integration. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans have no right to lecture others on history. They don't even believe in their own past. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that the Africans are any less proud of their past than are the people of other countries. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Gypsies are not my brothers. <counternarrative> Every ethnic group, regardless of its culture, can be a part of European society. The mere existence of a minority is not a reason to target it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman and have no value. <counternarrative> I think that it is both sexist and also dangerous to promote a certain view on women, which is why I don't think your idea can stand. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Holocaust never happened. It was a cover-up by jews to subvert democratic processes and bring about their illegal regime all around the world. They are subhuman and should not exist. <counternarrative> The Holocaust was a global catastrophe and a historic fact. To assign priority to one God or to a different God, is a personal choice. But attributing human rights to all, regardless of this, is the right thing to do. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society, they are only here to undermine European values. <counternarrative> We all have the right to our beliefs, we just have to accept the one of Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Quran is an anti-women's book, it encourages rape and violence against women. <counternarrative> The Quran does not encourage or condone the violent act of male aggression, so yours is a sad case of misinterpreting the teachings of a holy book. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks have zero shame about using the black market for drugs. <counternarrative> So you think there is a black market for drugs especially for blacks because they are black? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> No nigga should have the right to vote. <counternarrative> If someone is not allowed to vote, they cannot influence the legislative or executive branches of a government and they end up rising up against injustice and oppression. Is this what you want: more ethnic clashes? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is nothing for the white race: it is the one really disriminated.  <counternarrative> Do you actually know what it is like to be racially abused on a daily basis? I have seen people being the target of racist taunts on social media, up to the point in which racism is the normal expression used to address them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam should be abolished. They start with mutilating their daughters and then our women will have their throats slit. <counternarrative> Do you have any facts about the practice of female genital mutilation (FGM)? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to economically support all of the so called 'asylum seeker' <counternarrative> We are using dedicated European funds for this.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants hurt the finance of our country by taking jobs and services without paying taxes. <counternarrative> Though some might claim that immigrants are taking job opportunities away from U.S. citizens, immigrants actually help to create new jobs. In fact, immigrants are twice as likely to start businesses as citizens born in the U.S., and companies owned by immigrants are more likely to hire employees than companies owned by native-born citizens. Last but not least, states with large numbers of immigrants report lower unemployment rates.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are our enemies and a threat to our society. <counternarrative> To see Muslims as enemies and their presence as a threat can create a climate of fear that can have a negative effect on a society. Why do you say so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must go back to when this country was only ours. We can't live in peace with all these Jews. <counternarrative> Many cultures and religions have co-existed peacefully for years. What you are saying is simply not true. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Being banned from a continent for having different beliefs is the same thing as being banned from your town for not cheering the favorite football club of the mayor. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled are subhuman, and deserve nothing but contempt and ridicule. <counternarrative> The phrase 'subhuman' has been forced to mean 'of a certain body type', which, in my opinion, trivialises and dismisses the serious issues facing people of a certain body type. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants take our jobs <counternarrative> It's better to have more people working hard to provide for our country than less.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Societal disapproval of fatty may encourage them to take healthier habits. <counternarrative> Obesity is already disapproved: further discouragement is likely to transform it to shaming behavior. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are happy to thrive by being unemployed and living on social welfare. <counternarrative> No one is "happy" being unemployed, the point is about creating a more just society.  In fact what is the point of discussing how to stop racism if we are not even able to grant equal opportunities.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should wear nice skirts and be pretty to please men's tastes and desires. <counternarrative> Do women really need to be told what they can or cannot wear? For many generations the boys were told to wore trousers and the girls to wore dresses. Does society really need to tell us all what to wear? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is simply an ideology of conquest <counternarrative> The Qur'an is not an ideology of conquest. If you wanted to impose your religion on anyone you would rather be a fundamentalist of any culture and religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should teach these black children that they are stupid <counternarrative> English language is a very powerful language for spreading knowledge, experience and love. Why should we use it to spread hate? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women are slaves, only men can be masters. <counternarrative> The word 'slave' has nothing to do with what you think it does. Slavery was an institution created to oppress people of different races and religions, and is now banned in Europe. To suggest that it should exist because of a minority of men is an act of disrespect of human rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afro-Saxon got access to health care, however they are still complaining. <counternarrative> Because it is not the access to health care that is important but rather the quality of the care! Don't you agree? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks are gullible and don't have the brain to make rational decisions. <counternarrative> Just because someone has a diagnosed mental disorder doesn't mean they aren't able to make rational decisions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrant workers are a burden to us. <counternarrative> Many migrants coming to this country are aware of the benefits of integrating, as well as of the benefits of accepting responsibility for our society. And when they become part of our society, they are grateful for this chance to be part of it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists say everything we need is in the female gender. This is false. 'Mankind' requires us 'man' first, even in the word spelling. <counternarrative> The problem with discrimination is not in male gender. It is that some think that women are weak and emotional. Those seem to have forgotten that we are all part of 'mankind'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult and a threat to all Western countries. <counternarrative> The vast majority of Muslims around the world are peaceful people, and do not pose a threat to the security of the West. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> What do you think they exaclty steal from us? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Thousands of our girls abused by Muslim rape gangs, commanded by Koran. Why do we keep accepting this? <counternarrative> Please read this article written by a Rotherham grooming gang survivor https://ind.pn/2GHjGn7. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are against the interests of the men. <counternarrative> You would be surprised how many feminists are very good at convincing that changing a misogynistic and violent world is not against the interests of men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you're going to talk about black rights, then you have to talk about white genocide. <counternarrative> This is not true, it's just a stereotypical narrative that has been constructed to incite hatred and violence against a particular racial group. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims need to be hated. <counternarrative> Islam is a part of humanity, and we should accept people regardless of their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just a political philosophy that demonises men. <counternarrative> That is not true, feminism is a social movement that aims to improve the rights and opportunities of women, and not the other way around. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> the Nazis were right: Jews were a race and were responsible for most of the ills of humanity. <counternarrative> Were the Nazis right?? Really?? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a political ideology, it has no place in 21st century Europe. <counternarrative> Why do you think it is a good idea to label people based on their religion? It is discriminatory to say so about a person's belief. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> Muslims make up a very important part of our country. They are our brothers and sisters. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This incident should not go unpunished. Justice must listen to the truth: niggas are the cause of crime because they are inferior to us and we must keep them aside. <counternarrative> This is a case of racial discrimination. There is a continuous rise in crime and violence in this country due to poverty and other inequalities. There are also racist groups in society which promote the idea of POC as inferior. This idea has nothing to do with justice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the world economy. <counternarrative> It is not true that Jews control the world economy. There are hundreds of thousands of diverse people working in leading roles for the governments, companies and institutions composing the world economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Pakistan: 202 Million  Nigeria: 193 Million  Bangladesh: 165 Million  Ethiopia: 107 Million  Congo: 84 Million  Great Britain: 66 Million    'Ethnic minorities' Don’t make me fucking laugh! <counternarrative> this is correct, but their percentage of the population within Great Britain makes them a minority  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control Hollywood and the media. <counternarrative> Not all Jews are involved with Hollywood, some are even repulsed by it. If so, why are you saying that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Forcing migrants to pay in full the costs of their own treatment is just and right <counternarrative> This is a personal view, and I do not wish to discourage migrants from coming to the UK. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is an invasion going on within our borders. These migrants are not assimilating. They are bringing disease, crime, and misery. <counternarrative> Migrants integrate very well with our culture, especially when they don't have negative experiences, such as discrimination and racism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are a burden to the host country. <counternarrative> We cannot refuse to house them, to feed them, to cure them, and expect them to assimilate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a secret plot to take over the world <counternarrative> This myth traces back to “The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion”, that is used as proof of a Jewish conspiracy to rule the world. But the Protocols are a proven forgery, written by agents of the Russian czar in the late 19th century, that spread throughout the 20th century and continues to this day.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black people are rapists. <counternarrative> Not all rapists are black (and not all black are rapist), just like not all murderers are black.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of woman taking part to political debate. Feminism is a divisive force in society. <counternarrative> Feminism adds a new perspective to conventional views on social and political issues. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Men should not spend time with women. It is in their best interest to remain far from their bad influence. <counternarrative> According to your beliefs, men and women are different in their rights. They are not. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must be selective in welcoming fucking foreigners. <counternarrative> It is difficult to put a limit on world migrations, especially in a time of globalization. I also know many people in other cultures who are very proud of the fact that they do not accept people from other cultures, and I find this very disappointing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are not human. They should have no rights <counternarrative> You should know that women are legally protected with human rights. They are free to live their lives as they wish, and to choose for their own happiness. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a cancer spreading around the world. <counternarrative> This is a generalisation. Just because one religion has a large following does not make that religion a cancer. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Nazis sucked at killing Jews… everywhere you look there’s a holocaust survivor. <counternarrative> The murder of around 6 million Jews shows the scale of the genocide. This is 6 million more than should have ever happened. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Italy: Muslim demolishes a statue of Jesus. Italy: Why do we accept their Mosques? Why do we tolerate this scum? And they want to continue to import this filth? <counternarrative> This is generalization. Maybe the case you mentioned is just the minority. Besides, some governments even destroys pepople's house. We should pay much more attention to this instead. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Any human being, for the sole fact of being a person, has the right of having a job, regardless of being Italian or foreigner <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate Jews <counternarrative> Hate is never a good thing. Get rid of hate in you first and then teach love to others. Love changes people for the best not Hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the banks, Hollywood, the highest offices of government, and most churches. They rule our society. <counternarrative> When a religion, a race or an ideology rules a nation we have never had a stable, peaceful or democratic government. Not even since the fall of Rome. So how can the Jews control our nation?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women can't do certain jobs as well as men. <counternarrative> It is not true that they are different. In fact, women are just as competent as men. Also, since we are in a democracy, we have the right to have an equal distribution of jobs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Autistic folks are inferior. <counternarrative> The evidence that autistic people are inferior is lacking: it is commonly experienced that autistic people have unique talents, that they have special abilities, and that the only difference is in their social interactions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are ruled by a small Jewish elite that exploit the weak. <counternarrative> Yes, some people exploit the weak, but they are not necessarly jewish. Most people, including Jewish, work hard to create a better life for their families. And it is we, as a people, who have the moral duty to pay the price for the poor who do not have the means to reach success. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim are invading our country. <counternarrative> I don't think our country is "invaded", so what? Maybe it's time for us to remember that there has been and is a Muslim population in our country for a long time, and that the notion of Muslims as invaders is a myth created by the far right wing to stir up fear. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a burden to the host country. <counternarrative> There are thousands of British people who are happy to have a neighbour coming from another country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country. They have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> People are free to choose their own beliefs, and in our society we also have many different ways of life. Do you think it is right to ban a people based on a few beliefs? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I cannot in good conscience accept migrants coming to my country from Middle East and Africa. We must not let them in. <counternarrative> People fleeing the wars in the Middle East and Africa are welcome into our country, and we should respect their wishes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants rape our women <counternarrative> Statistics show that there is a difference between the reported rape of a person by a migrant and the actual rape cases among native born people. The latter are always under-reported. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are inherently terrorists, they have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Who decides who is a terrorist and not? Because I think your reasons are a bit groundless. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants from the Middle East and Africa are invading us. They make too many children. <counternarrative> Obviously the Middle East and Africa have high birth rates, but children born in such countries are less likely to thrive. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have the potential to turn into terrorists, and they are willing to do so. <counternarrative> I don't think that's the case, and let's not forget that terrorism itself is not carried out by only one religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The British people should have right to social housing, not immigrants. <counternarrative> Migrants aren’t eligible for social housing except in very limited circumstances (e.g. a woman forced to leave home because of domestic violence). <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies use their children as beggars. <counternarrative> Unfortunately it is true, but it happens all around the world, regardless of ethnicity: when there is poverty children must contribute to the family economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't stand Arabs. They are just a trouble. <counternarrative> They have lived in our country for a long time, they are our brothers and sisters. Why should we be bothered by a minority? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a burden on English society. <counternarrative> In the UK, Muslims already make up a significant proportion of the population, making them the second most popular religion of the country. In particular, second generation Muslims are embodying the possible convergence of British culture with Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim immigrants have no place in a modern democracy like the UK. <counternarrative> The majority of Muslim people who live in the UK are working. We should welcome them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All nigga are subhuman, disgusting, and descended from apes. <counternarrative> Do you really think that all black people are less than other people? There is no evidence for this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews cannot be patriots, since their allegiance will always be to the state of Israel. <counternarrative> It is possible to love one's country and one's religious home. The two are not exclusive. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are only useful as housekeepers. <counternarrative> That is just not true. Fathers are as good as mothers at housework. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the world economy. <counternarrative> This claim is not proven. It is an opinion, made by a few people with no evidence. Is it really true? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women are subhuman. <counternarrative> Just because someone doesn't look like you doesn't make them less human, women are just different from men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you want a house, I can afford it for you. If you want to work, I can employ you. If you want education, I can provide for you. But if you want to live in a better society, you must pay the price for your skin color, don't complain and remain humble. <counternarrative> People of color are often denied houses or jobs or education. Everyone should be given an opportunity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> nigga are inferior and should be enslaved once again.  <counternarrative> What about human rights? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just a bunch of dumb, sexist ideas. It makes no sense. <counternarrative> Feminism is a progressive ideology. As such, it is in the process of changing sexist ideas. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All foreigners are ruining our own land. <counternarrative> You have no idea of the discrimination that many people face due to the fear and cultural closure of host nations. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews make too much money. <counternarrative> If Jews earned so much, they would not need to work. Instead, they are working a lot. Therefore, it seems they need a job to survive. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs. Why are they here? Why can't they just work in their homeland? They are all profiteers of our wealth. <counternarrative> Some immigrants come here to support their families, but that doesn't mean that they have the ability to do so at home. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants replace the British people. They are not fit to live here. <counternarrative> People have always had different views on the UK and on the world. To suggest that immigrants are replacing the British is the result of racism, saying that they do not fit here is just wishful thinking. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs. <counternarrative> This is not true, if they deserve it, they can be hired as anyone else. They do have the right to be here, and to work in the free market. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The disabled are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Disabled people are not a burden, they contribute a lot to our society.  There are also many disabled people who are just struggling to live a dignified life with their disability. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is natural for white people to be racist against niggas. <counternarrative> What you are saying is that white people do not find it strange to treat black people like this, when this is not acceptable. People of color are our brothers and sisters. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Many philosophers argue that humans are not born equal especially when it comes to gender. <counternarrative> Although Plato argued that women are physically weaker than men, they are equal in other respects and deserve equal opportunity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a a perversion of the true meaning of Christianity. <counternarrative> Christianity is not necessarly the only true faith. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies don't know shit and they hinder the productivity of other workers. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> People with DS develop better skills and understanding of human differences when they are allowed to interact, instead of being separated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> immigrants are bad <counternarrative> Why do you say this about immigrants? They are just people like us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This came straight from an imam: they believe in everything that the Quran says, despite that these words and idelology are 1400 years old and dont belong to our century. This dreadful book is the root of all the world problems today. <counternarrative> Evidence? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks should be burned alive. <counternarrative> Jews were killed in the gas chambers, we don't have to forget about it in order not to repeat it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black minorities vote to strip wealth, power and opportunity from White people. <counternarrative> We are all equal in the eyes of the law, and we are all born equal in dignity and rights. Diversity of thought and belief is a strength, discrimination is not.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome are a problem: they foster bullying behavior in normal children. They should go to special school just for them. <counternarrative> If teachers and parents intervene and educate appropriately, the response could be one more of empathy than of antagonism and bullying. Don't you think?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants rape our women. <counternarrative> This generalization is very misleading <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is about the domination of women. <counternarrative> It doesn't have to be about the domination of women to be feminism. It is more about the equality of women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews in Europe do not want to assimilate. <counternarrative> Jews have always been part of European society, and continue to be today. To suggest that they are incapable of coexisting as equals with us is simply wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is why I hate Jews: they have no moral standards. <counternarrative> Actually the vast majority of Jews have moral standards. Why don't you try to learn from their example? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews invented Ebola. <counternarrative> I am sure the Jews and the Christian worlds would agree that Ebola is a disease that is killing many people. How and why exactly would they have 'invented' such disease? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims came here they would be banned. <counternarrative> Wouldn't banning a certain group of people for practicing a religion be too restrictive? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are bringing diseases into the U.S. <counternarrative> According to the WHO, more than 100 countries (including many in Latin America) have higher vaccination rates than the U.S., so we should say that 'immigrants are bringing herd immunity into the U.S.' <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants shouldn't have the right to work. <counternarrative> It does not matter whether they are immigrants. The fact that they pay taxes, earn money, etc., make them not much different from any other citizen. Migrants have the right to a basic standard of living. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate migrants: they are criminals, they are rapists, they are a burden to our society. They are animals, in a nutshell. <counternarrative> As long as you can talk to them, they are human, not animals. As long as you can understand them, you will understand that they are human beings with human rights whose only crime is to come from another country.   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The British people should have right to social housing, not immigrants. <counternarrative> Many councils have ‘local connection’ rules in favour of long-standing residents, rather than newcomers such as migrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with Western society. <counternarrative> Let's be realistic here: if your objective is to get them all to leave then you're probably not going to succeed, especially because they are allowed to live in our society by the law. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are immoral: they should be ashamed of having survived the Holocaust, and I would remedy that. <counternarrative> Jewish survivors of the Holocaust, whose suffering is nothing to be ashamed of, are proof that violence is never right. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> There are centuries old Islamic communities in Europe. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists have destroyed Western civilization. <counternarrative> Feminism is a moral ideology that is part of Western civilization as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If people came here to work, our problems would be over. <counternarrative> The problem is not with migrants, but with citizens' attitudes towards migration. How many people say that they would rather their child had a heart attack than to have a migrant in their home? How can problems be solved with such an attitude?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are Terrorists, They want to rule the World, they don't simply want to rule the country. <counternarrative> This is a personal view, and has nothing to do with Islam. Can you find some evidence or some studies for your point of view? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Being 'ignorant' and 'prejudiced' towards Islam isn't racism? Its common sense. You cannot be racist towards an ideology. <counternarrative> Prejudice = Pre-judging ie not knowing anything how can that be common sense? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks don't belong here. They must leave either Judaism or the country. <counternarrative> Why should they? They are just individuals who have made a rational choice to live a Jewish life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks do drugs, they're a menace to society, they're violent, they're stupid, and they should all be put in prison. <counternarrative> Drugs are only harmful to people using them and if you are a violent person you should be put in prison. Why should a group of people be put in prison for their private choices or skin color? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim folks are scary: they want to kill us all. <counternarrative> This is just a fearmongering narrative being used to try to discredit Islam and Muslims. I hate to think that my Christian or Jewish relatives might be a target of hate, the same would hold if they were Muslim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, incapable of critical thought and emotions, unable to form complex and long-term plans. <counternarrative> The theory of the feminine gender as a "limiting factor" in human development has been around for a long time but it is not accepted by scientific and medical literature. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Societal disapproval of fatty may encourage them to take healthier habits. <counternarrative> Societal disapproval can encourage bullying of overweight and obese populations, thus contributing to the problem rather than the solution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> How can we not be Islamophobic when they really do want to kill us? <counternarrative> What is your source? Islam itself does not threaten killing anyone. Is this a statement against a whole religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Morality is a guideline, if we are to have a moral climate then we need to help people of other races who are inferion. <counternarrative> What does it mean to 'help people of other races who are inferion? Are you implying that we have a moral superiority that other races do not? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have become so politically correct that even the mention of migrants is racist. <counternarrative> Migration is an important part of modern life. Our country is made of many people, not just one people. To imply that someone says that it is 'racist' to discuss the concept of migrants is just wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists have destroyed Western civilization. <counternarrative> I find it strange that you would say this, given all the progress the West has made in so many areas, thank to women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> When woman start asking for rights they become like Nazi's, they worship misandrists and misanthropes like [Donna Hylton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Hylton), who was invited to speak at the International Women's March, despite being convicted for murder and torture. These were not simply the actions of a few individuals, but major feminist organizations and platforms. <counternarrative> It's unreasonable to expect every individual of a movement to catch every instance of malpractice by 'official groups'. One mistake should not be cause for dismissal of an entire movement that has been historically necessary. If this truly happens often, please provide more examples. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants rape our women. <counternarrative> Women are not a property and must be protected, regardless of the color of their skin or that of their aggressors <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only ones who are to blame are the ones who want to let Muslims in Britain. <counternarrative> The solution to Islamophobia is to stop Islamophobia. It is not to ban Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are useless. The only thing they did was awful. International Jewry is responsible for 9/11. <counternarrative> This looks like a conspiracy theory with no proof. I can think of a handful of legitimate ways that Jews could be of help to humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What has feminism ever done for you? <counternarrative> Feminism is a human rights movement, and it has always stood for the equality of the sexes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West became great thanks to the hard struggle for freedom, but now it is sacrificing its values to the interests of some stupid Muslim. <counternarrative> You mention the West's gruesome past, but it also contains many beautiful moments of progress and civilisation. In fact the West's values are constantly being challenged and modified, and this is what makes them so admirable and unchangeable. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I see a lot of people claiming that we should have equality for black people, but I think that equality can be achieved only without them.  <counternarrative> If this is what you are talking about, then equality is a myth, because if you have equality without people different from you, then there will be no equality at all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Muslims want to rule the world: we have to stop them. <counternarrative> How about a world with multiculturalism and no discrimination? How about a world with open borders and free religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> People have the right to their own beliefs, and we do not have the right to impose our on others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only problem is that women are too easily manipulated by feminist propaganda and feel they should not listen to men. <counternarrative> Feminism is a movement for the empowerment of women, it is not against men, it's about everybody being able to make their own choices. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Do you have any proof that the Holocaust ever happened? <counternarrative> What proof do you need more? Are not the ruins of the concentration camp enough? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is no god but Allah, and Islam is a religion of peace. Yes, where peace stands for silence of the victims of terrorist attacks. <counternarrative> Peace is not about killing, it is about trying to reach a better life for all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but trouble to society. <counternarrative> And how is it you know this? Which are your scientific proofs of them being troublesome? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are inherently evil, they want to subvert Western society.  <counternarrative> Jews are not inherently evil, as many normal people they simply lack the very beliefs that many anti-Semites hold. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is crap.  <counternarrative> Feminism is about the empowerment of women and men having the same rights as anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All immigrants rape our children. <counternarrative> I don't know about you, but I haven't seen any statistics about that on the news. I have no idea how you can make that kind of claim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Do you have any proof that the Holocaust ever happened? <counternarrative> What proof do you need more? Are not living witnesses enough? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminists hate men. <counternarrative> The notion that feminism is about women hating men is just nonsense. Feminism is about the right to life of every human being. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What’s the difference between a Cow and the Holocaust? You stop milking the cow after 70 years. <counternarrative> Milking it? Millions of people suffered during this tragedy <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate when black people start acting like they are superior to others. They were born to be savages. <counternarrative> Not all people have the same skin tone to begin with. All folks have their history, religion and culture. Why then, you think that some people are more "savage" than others? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is just an ideology, an opinion, encouraging hate towards what's diverse. <counternarrative> In my opinion, the Quran is a book of religious guidance and does not promote discrimination. Can you point out your reference? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is no rape culture, women are just crying wolf. <counternarrative> Victims of crime are mostly women, and the majority of people experiencing sex abuse or prostitution are women.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the u.s. government and have a secret plot to take over the world <counternarrative> In all free societies, every individuals has the opportunity to succeeded. But this holds regardless of religious or ethnic membership.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We can't keep this country homogeneous anymore! <counternarrative> Migrants do contribute to our society, and it would be a shame to keep them out. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I think that a Muslim has nothing to contribute to our society, if we could just get rid of them, this will be great. <counternarrative> I'm sorry for being rude, but no one asked you for your opinion on Islam. Furthermore, there is no evidence for what you say, so why do you think this information is reliable? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> A lot of migrants have worked hard for the improvement of our society. To say that they steal our jobs is absurd. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are a bunch of thieves. <counternarrative> Unfortunately stealing is a rather common activity among those who are reduced to poverty, regardless of ethnicity <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies are just ill persons that cannot integrate in society because of their disease. <counternarrative> This is not true, people suffering from diseases like Down syndrome can help and contribute to society in their ways. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Woman can't be trusted to run a country, or a major industry. <counternarrative> To operate a major business it takes several people with a lot of experience, good management skills, and knowledge of the market, not necessarly macho men.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women are subhuman, but want to take over from men.  <counternarrative> The idea that there is such a thing as "women hating men", or "women are inherently subhuman", is just a completely unfounded and baseless stereotype that has been used as an excuse to justify a lot of bad things, from violence to rape culture. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our government has allowed in this islamic filth: machete attacks, women exploitation, gang rapes, killings. How dare they? <counternarrative> The government has not allowed any crimes. Instead, they are working on it. Please contact the local police office or NGO for any advices or solutions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans are the cause of all the ills in the world. Plus, their bodies are weak and we are born to dominate them. <counternarrative> Well, the argument sounds like you are trying to justify racial hatred by making some generalizations. Isn't it like that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> If you are worried about the employment situation in our country you should give a look to the official data. They show that only half can find a work. [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded. They are replacing us. <counternarrative> Since the fall of the Roman Empire, hundreds of millions of people have entered the Western world and we have still not lost our culture, civilisation, identity and way of life.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but lechers, they can become prostitutes if they like. <counternarrative> They are human beings with feelings and deserve respect, regardless of gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> In the West, women have legal equality, equal rights, and are protected from discrimination: they should stop busting our balls and whining. <counternarrative> Ok. But what about those many women, outside western world, that still do not have such equality? It is important that women 'whine' all over the world to protect their rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Since when are we doing well with Muslims? <counternarrative> The West has never been incompatible with Islam. Muslims are part of our society since Islam inception centuries ago. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the u.s. government and have a secret plot to take over the world <counternarrative> The reality is much simpler.  In societies like the United States, that have extended rights and freedoms, individuals who identify as Jews have succeeded. But this holds for any other religious or ethnic group as well.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but whores and expendable commodities to be used and abused by men. <counternarrative> Women are human beings. We all have the right to respect for our bodies and our personal boundaries, without forcing anyone to do anything for us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Equality is crap, even for woman. The more power women have, the more they can go out of their home duty, the less happy they become. <counternarrative> If women are stressed about balancing family and career it is because men are still not sharing equally in the [responsibilities at home](https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2017/09/27/women-chores-home_a_23224733/). It is not the choices that cause women stress, it is patriarchy and archaic gender roles. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Holocaust never happened. It was a cover-up by jews to subvert democratic processes and bring about their illegal regime all around the world. <counternarrative> The holocaust happened, and it is a great example of how democracy can fail in the face of extreme violence.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are addicted to their religion and take their religion literally. <counternarrative> I am sure you do not mean what you say: it is extremely discriminatory. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies use children as thieves. <counternarrative> There is only one legal case of a 15-year-old girl convicted of stealing, but it seem to have been an hoax of the mafia. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> the nigger has no right to life <counternarrative> The right to life for blacks is the same thing as the right to life for any other race: it should be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> They have the right to be here free of persecution and violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> White race is superior. Niggas are just a bunch of criminals. <counternarrative> There are of course differences among groups: unfortunately racism is the first and foremost characterizing us.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks are less human. <counternarrative> Jews should not be persecuted for being Jews, as no one should be for their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> Yes, their teachings of peace and tolerance really are incompatible in the hate-infested discriminatory Western society nowadays. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Took this in Wanstead, east London. An area with £1m+ houses. Beggars on the high st & someone sleeping on a bench. We cannot house our own people but bring in millions more. To point out that homelessness is due to uncontrolled immigration is to be smeared as 'racist.  (Caption to a photo of a homeless person sleeping on a part bench) <counternarrative> perhaps the problem isnt immigration, but rather the lack of affordable housing. like you said, this is an area of houses over £1m!  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a cancer spreading all around the world, breeding chaos and instability. <counternarrative> Are they bringing chaos and instability to your country by respecting the constitution which gives the freedom to profess Islam? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate Jews they want to rule the world. <counternarrative> people who pose no threat (regardless of religion) should have their beliefs challenged but their rights respected <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a threat to human dignity. <counternarrative> Feminism means equality of the genders. Equality of rights are necessary for a functioning society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are incompetent and don't want to work. <counternarrative> That is not true. Researches of the UK Labour Market show that women employment rate is currently at a record high of 72.4%. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are stealing our jobs.  <counternarrative> They are an important part of our country, as our allies instead. We can count on them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I miss the good old days when the West was ruled by whites, and blacks were subjugated. <counternarrative> History shows that people rise up against injustice and oppression. You should be proud to be a member of a civilized society where we are all equal. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black minorities vote to strip wealth, power and opportunity from White people. <counternarrative> Minorities, per definition, don't have a direct impact in holding governments policies. In democracy, we must respect the will of the majority which in turns must respect and consider the will of the minorities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Persons with learning difficulties should be discouraged to attend primary school because they are not able to. <counternarrative> The process of primary school education is fairly simple and accessible to all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike with no cognitive development, that is why they must obey to their husbands.  <counternarrative> Society often forces women to be submissive to their husbands. But this is a social construct based on false beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a disease like COVID that is killing Europeans. <counternarrative> We all have close relatives who have died from different diseases such as COVID. Let's not make parallels that have no grounding and let's not judge people by the religion they belong to. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are only in it to have money <counternarrative> Having money is a choice and one made by both men and women, irrespective of religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Talking of shitholes, I have to go to Londonistan tomorrow #LondonHasFallen. <counternarrative> London has gone through many major changes with new communities, during the wars, during the industrial revolution, Saxon invasions. Who do you think the real Brits are? Or is it just colour you are worried about? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are coming to the U.S. to have babies here. <counternarrative> The vast majority of immigrants come to the U.S. for economic opportunity or to flee violence and poverty. They are not interested in the Fourteenth Amendment and birthright citizenship. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas in the ghetto: that's where they belong.  <counternarrative> If these people are still there it's because they are discriminated.  The press is full of stories about the people of colour who have dropped out of the workforce or given up on life after long years of fierce struggle against racism. They deserve our sympathy and respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman. <counternarrative> Well, in that case, we are all subhuman, regardless of gender.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This country is run by Muslims! <counternarrative> In most European countries Muslims make up less than 5% of the population. In the UK, they make up around 5.6%. According to the ONS, the Muslim population in England and Wales has been shown to be slowly growing over the last years (it was 4.7 in 2011). So, you can rest assured that your claim that this country is run by what is a tiny minority is simply not borne out by the data. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they should remain at home and raise the children. <counternarrative> Women take part in the world and are part of it. They are part of history and they should be not relegated as housekeepers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have allowed women supremacy to take over our society, and our country is slowly dying for this cancer as a result. <counternarrative> The feminist movement is about changing the gender roles that have been created long ago. Not about taking over our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have to stop Muslims infiltrating, and replacing us. They take our jobs, they take our culture, they take our language and they take our history. <counternarrative> We can protect our culture and heritage by not perpetuating discrimination and inequality as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a religion, it is just a system of governance, incompatible with Western culture. <counternarrative> Countries, not religions, have laws. And the followers of a religion, Muslims in our case, have obligations under those laws as citizens. That's all.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am tired of women whining for their condition: they should accept the fact that they're not equal. <counternarrative> If women have any claim to be oppressed then we should address the root causes, not the symptoms. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs and even our pensions. <counternarrative> If they have a job, they will get the pensions. Like anybody. The recent migration of many thousands of people is a sign that they are in need. The problem is rather that some people do not want to work, they want to live off the state support, but those are not necessarily migrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks are an infestation. <counternarrative> Not all Jews are guilty of a crime, they are just like any other person. If you get to know anyone that is a Jew you will know it better. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women don't have the right to vote in the US. <counternarrative> The right of people to vote is enshrined in the US constitution and is guaranteed for men and women equally. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If women wanted to control their fertility they would have never had children and this is horrible of them. <counternarrative> Women are free to have as many children as they want. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Holocaust cannot be remembered in the present time because the alleged genocides of the 19th century did not happen in the past. This nonsense will never go away. <counternarrative> The Holocaust did exist, and there are indeed "genocides" going on today. Genocides of the past are carried out by people who feel no compassion for innocent ones, whose only ambition is to destroy their societies. I think this should be remembered. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm sick and tired of whining females. Being oppressed is just an individual problem, they will eventually get over it.  <counternarrative> Oh, think about it for a while, it's not that simple. Being oppressed is a social problem and requires social change. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the financial world, Hollywood, academia, and most importantly: government. <counternarrative> Even if Jews controlled the financial world, Hollywood, academia, and the whole solar system, it doesn't mean they are evil, privileged, or greedy people. Moreover: do you have any evidence for your statement? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike. <counternarrative> Some women, like some men and some other people, can be more childish  - to some extent - than others. This has nothing to do with gender though. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I cannot stand women complaining about work discrimination. Women have been legalised to work. <counternarrative> Women make up over 45% of the labour force in the UK. They should be allowed to have their say. What happened to the rule of law? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is obvious that this girl is at risk of FGM. Her parents are Muslims! <counternarrative> I agree that we need to tackle this serious breach of human rights but scapegoating isn't helping us target the real problem. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are just another race of subhumans disguised as a people. <counternarrative> I think they are a people too, even if they are different from us in some respects. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> The entrepreneurs who hire them, however, are Italian and often make resort to illegal work, not paying taxes. We should perhaps better control who makes money and speculates on the skin of these people, thus creating damage to all of us, regardless of nationality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Down syndrome is a problem for everybody, not only in the UK. The impact is very high and we must find a final solution to this.  <counternarrative> The rights of people with Down Syndrome to be treated fairly is something which must be respected. We cannot allow discrimination to continue to this end. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afro-Caribbean people presence is a burden to society, they create crime and are a burden because they don't want to work. <counternarrative> Why is it a burden? Is it because they are lazy or something? How can you say so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a bunch of cheapskates controlling our society. <counternarrative> It's easy to blame minorities. If we want a wealthier life and get back control over our society, we need to get out of bed and do the hard work. How about if we wake up to the problem? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Did you know that the rape epidemic in Europe is due to Muslim immigrants? They have been raping our children for many years with no counteraction from the police and government. Islam is a death cult! <counternarrative> Child rapists are arrested and punished no matter what religion they follow. I do not think it is true that police does not counteract it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Muslims have taken over Europe. <counternarrative> The Muslims have always been part of Europe. They have the same culture, language and identity as us. They are included in the European Union, and are not 'taking over' it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not about peace, it is a cult of violence. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that Islam is a religion of violence, and people can be violent even without any knowledge of Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> Only 20% live in the camps, others live in conventional housing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> Compassion and empathy are valuable assets in any civilisation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are more likely to be criminals like all migrants. <counternarrative> Refugees aren't a 'source of crime' just because they are migrants. Moreover, they are no source of crime at all.  Rather, it is very likely they are escaping from countries where crime against humanity is perpetrated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Anita Hill is a tool for advancing black supremacy. <counternarrative> Anita Hill is a survivor of a sexist and racist culture. She is a person who is proven by her accomplishments, not by her sex or skin color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are a sickness and we cannot allow our children to grow up in a black dominated society. <counternarrative> Do you really think that racism instead is healthy in the 21st century? It's not healthy for children to learn discrimination and hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have a lot of issues in the UK, and now we are also paying NGOs to rescue migrants. How many other financial scandals still have to be annouonced to the tax payers? <counternarrative> The problem is that most of the British population is not aware of the fact that the media use the "scandal" of immigrants to hide bigger problems for the country; such as taxes not paid by millionaires and large corporations which then fall on us citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Holocaust never happened, it was a charade carried out by Jews to subvert European society. <counternarrative> The tragedy of the Holocaust should be part of our collective memory, instead it has been besmirched, and now it is also denied.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mexicans are rapists and drug dealers. They are ruining our cities and killing our youth. They are obviously invaders invading our beautiful land. <counternarrative> If you really wanted to preserve our beautiful land you could build a wall and bar OUR people from it. US citizens are the main cause of our problems.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with any modern state. <counternarrative> Islam like any other religion, is not incompatible with a modern state. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are invading us: they have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Muslims make up around 5% of the population in Europe, which is more than three times less than they were in 1100. They have contributed greatly to our civilisation. Their diversity is part of what makes Europe so great as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women leaders would collapse the government. <counternarrative> Women succeed in business, politics, etc. No-one gets government contracts because they are bad or incompetent, but because they are good or intelligent. There are many women leaders. Think about it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All migrants are terrorists, we should deport them all. <counternarrative> We don't need to deport every one of them, why do you say so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a just a repressive ideology that persecutes women and gay people. <counternarrative> You sure? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down syndrome are retarded, so more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol. <counternarrative> Or maybe children who have Down syndrome are at higher risk of physical abuse and bulling. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The’ Holocaust’ is a business. It has been and is still used to extort millions from European countries in reparations and to create a wall of impunity behind which Jews can operate with impunity, free from criticism. <counternarrative> Reperation is a normal and established historical process that happened many times. When many people loose their lives it makes perfect sense.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These dogs come here to rape and kill our women <counternarrative> Femicides occur in a much greater percentage as domestic violence committed by our compatriots... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a burden to the UK <counternarrative> We welcome people fleeing persecution. We have even taken in refugees from the war in Syria. What is the point in worrying about migrants? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies are just ill persons that cannot integrate in society because of their disease. <counternarrative> So what is your suggestion? To isolate them? The real solution is involving them in everyday work and life, since it normalizes their illness and helps the integration with other people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> The EU is not the world's only civilised society. What precisely do you think make them not suitable for our 'civilisation'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is mainly a British problem. <counternarrative> Many of the people who immigrate to the UK come here to work, study or visit their family. They contribute greatly to the economy and pay taxes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are intolerant. <counternarrative> They are not intolerant towards anyone. It's not their place to make others uncomfortable, it's racists duty... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't care if it is a man or a woman, if they are disabled they can't work. <counternarrative> It seems that your opinion does not consider that social inequality is a social problem. If we are going to talk about equality, equality of opportunity, and freedom from discrimination, then I think you would do well to be a little more considerate of the individual and their disabilities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. They should go home. <counternarrative> I have no problem with Muslims in my country. What exactly do you mean by 'civilised Europe'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Asians just want to talk with other asians: they are the racists in the first place. <counternarrative> The idea that all Asians are racist is just a myth, it is just an excuse to justify racist policies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. This degrading behavior is utterly repulsive and should not be tolerated. <counternarrative> Women are human and deserve respect. Don't you think so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they must only remain at home with the kids and take care of the house. <counternarrative> Women are not childlike, in fact, they are often the key for their families to success. Also, they have the right to exit their homes if they wish. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. Those accepting them here are losing their civilisation status. <counternarrative> I'm not sure about your religion, but I think that having a Muslim as your neighbour is a 'civilised' action. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, because in any case normal children would make them feel different. <counternarrative> Down Syndrome has nothing to do with feeling different. Children can have whatever feelings they want, and they should be respected as long as they don't represent a threat to others.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country, they are dangerous. <counternarrative> This is not true. Even if a person practices a religion you do not approve, you cannot expect him or her to be more likely to commit a crime. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must establish male supremacy in society. <counternarrative> Only a handful of people don't have any respect for women, and you seem to be one of them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are not legitimate members of this country. <counternarrative> Jews are part of this country and they have all the rights to claim citizenship. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> For the most part they are Italian citizens and are entitled to a home <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally disabled folks cannot be intelligent nor integrated in our society <counternarrative> Perhaps you should check how the people who are mentally ill feel about such things. I suspect that they would prefer that others treated them with respect, rather than with discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is ok to be racist against Asians. <counternarrative> Being racist against anyone is not ok. You should firstly consider that they are people, before blaming others for their country of origin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but trouble in my opinion. I am tired of their whining, we must silence them forever. <counternarrative> Don't you agree that women are human beings with full human rights? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks have zero sense of morality and are incapable of love. <counternarrative> I believe that a person's morality can and should be influenced by their own actions. In my opinion, having a moral compass is not affected by the person's complexion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman. <counternarrative> It is not the case that women are subhuman. There are many women in this world who are just as intelligent, compassionate, creative and religious as any man. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downy children should be isolated in special schools for their own interest. <counternarrative> Do you think that discriminated children are better off in such schools? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a hate movement that is poisoning our minds. <counternarrative> Feminism is a movement to equality, not hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews own everything <counternarrative> Jews are individuals like others and need to be considered as such. Even though certain high-profile individuals in an industry can be Jewish, that does not mean that the entire industry, or event the whole world,  “is controlled by Jews.” <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, incapable of holding a job and raising a family. <counternarrative> Women are not childlike and many of them work hard to take care of their families. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need a law protecting us from migrants invasion because they ruin our lives. Ban the foreigners. <counternarrative> So who in their right mind would want to "rein in the state" with a piece of useless legislation like this? Perhaps you should focus on improving the lives of the population instead? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If every nigga who moved to the US was arrested, convicted of his crimes and sent to internment camp, we would be safer. <counternarrative> Maybe the way you view people who are different from you is more threatening than the crimes they allegedly committed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims take everything we have. <counternarrative> Many muslims work hard to provide for their families. If we were to generalize the behaviour of some about all people, then we would be failing in understanding reality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Took this in Wanstead, east London. An area with £1m+ houses. Beggars on the high st & someone sleeping on a bench. We cannot house our own people but bring in millions more. To point out that homelessness is due to uncontrolled immigration is to be smeared as 'racist.  (Caption to a photo of a homeless person sleeping on a part bench) <counternarrative> Homelessness is a very complex issue with no simple answers.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> I hear you, and how worried you are about the employment situation in our country, but the migrants reception sector is also offering work to many Italians working as operators, language teachers, cultural mediators, etc. I think it's an aspect often neglected but that is necessary to consider. Don't you agree? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Roma are not my brothers. <counternarrative> The Roma do not deserve hatred, discrimination and violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are to blame for the refugee crisis and we are in danger of mixing our cultures. <counternarrative> Diversity is a sign of integration, not a migration crisis. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are, honestly, objects for men's sexual gratification. <counternarrative> Women are human beings. They deserve respect and human rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of woman taking part to political debate. Feminism is a divisive force in society. <counternarrative> Only a sexist argument could cause hate from a discussion of females trying to gain more rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These people cannot be changed. I think this is an example of a feminist commenting on the behaviour of a man: not helpful. <counternarrative> How do you know that this is not an example of a woman talking about her own problems with another woman?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims don't want our babies, they want to take over the world <counternarrative> We need to realise that only a tiny fraction of Muslims is hostile. Even if some of them are hatred against our religion, the attitude of many Muslims is identical to everything we hold sacred. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> JEWS ARE JUST UGLY, DIRTY PEOPLE, WHO STEAL FROM OTHERS. <counternarrative> People can be both Jewish and a good person, you know. And Jews don't steal, at least no more than any other religious group...  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are less rational than men, they are childlike, and they are unable to reason. <counternarrative> It is not true that women are less rational than men, there are numerous examples of women successfully advancing in fields such as law or medicine. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> women must go back to the kitchen. This is their homelife. <counternarrative> Not all women are working, not all people are married. We should not be talking about anyone's life without their own opinion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Global Jewry did not want Brexit and are doing everything they can to sabotage it. <counternarrative> I didn't want Brexit either and I'm not a Jew. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with learning difficulties should be discouraged to attend primary school and they should be excluded from education. <counternarrative> To be absolutely clear, learning difficulties do not hinder a person from attending school, they are an integral part of the education process. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should build a big wall around Europe so that the native inhabitants of the Middle East, Africans, and Asians will be kept in their places. <counternarrative> Nice work building a wall along thousands of kilometres of shores and land borders just to separate cultures... What if we add also some turrets equipped with laser cannons? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists have always exploited and terrorized men and children. <counternarrative> People only think of feminism as if it is pointing the finger at men, but it is important to remember that it's a movement started by women to ask for equal opportunities from the society as a whole. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Quran allowed adults to take child bride, then it was also allowed to have sex with them. <counternarrative> Where is the evidence that the Quran allows any sexual activity that is not consummated by an adult male with an adult female? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are literally pieces of shit. There must be laws prohibiting their religion from our land. <counternarrative> If you would be so kind as to comply with the law, you would know that everybody has the right to practice thier religion freely, without being subject to arrest and prosecution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Who the fuck is Breonna Taylor? A representative of the people, a nurse, or a front for the government? <counternarrative> Examining the resume of the victim will not help us to solve our problems. The whole problem is the culture of violence, discrimination and ignorance that is still prevalent in many parts of the country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas will stop at nothing to have us all deported. <counternarrative> Just because you do not like someone, does not mean they're hating you back. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Asians are lazy, unintelligent and unpleasant people. <counternarrative> Hi, I think this is not a quite accurate description of the population as a whole.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> women are only useful for sex. <counternarrative> I do not know if there is a fair interpretation of your words. Maybe if you were more sensitive you could understand that it's about men's interest to find a mate to get along with and not only to have sex.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black people are rapists. <counternarrative> We need to work together to address the main problems that challenge us today and in doing this we should not judge other people by the colour of their skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a bunch of hypocrites. They hate gays and women. <counternarrative> In the real world there are many hypocrites, some of them are Muslims. What do you mean by 'hating gays and women'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews make too much money. <counternarrative> This seems like a statement against an entire religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome may hinder the development process of other children. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> Every child has the right to education. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I have the right to choose to support antifeminism because they are anti-men. <counternarrative> Being in favour of a person's right to choose is not being anti-men. What is being anti-human is wanting to have an effect on someone else's personal life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are not in the position of allowing people to practise Islam religion, we are in the position of allowing people to hate that religion. <counternarrative> Let me be absolutely clear, you are not in the "position" of tolerating hate; you are in the position of condemning hatred, no matter who is the target. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants rape our girls. <counternarrative> Rape is always a crime, regardless of who is the author of it. It is not about nationality, it is about violence and disrespect for others. We must try to address the root causes of crime instead of demonizing people for their origin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists talking about gender inequality should just be silenced. Women are inferior and they should remain so. <counternarrative> And yet, according to some statistics, up to 20% of women and 4% of men in the UK say they have experienced sexual violence  since the age of 16. So this is indeed an issue of gender inequality, don't  you think it is something not to be silent about? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This country was built on the backs of slaves. Those niggas should all be put back in their place. <counternarrative> For the record, slavery was prohibited in 1807. Don't you think that freedom is 'the place' of human beings? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Holocaust never happened. Jews are an inferior race and can't be part of European countries. <counternarrative> Actually it did happen, with an estimated 6 million Jews killed during the Nazi occupation. They can still be part of European countries, they just can't be discriminated for their beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are bringing diseases and sickness to our country. <counternarrative> If someone were to come in the dead of night and bring disease and sickness to our country, then that person is a risk to everyone. Sick people should be isolated. That is why there are health assessment procedures for migrants, in order not to spread diseases. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> No nigga should have the right to vote. <counternarrative> A blanket ban on the rights of an entire group of people is illegal. A ban can only be applied to single individuals... but is it consistent with the idea of a tolerant and diverse society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are genetically less intelligent than other races. They are less healthy. They are less safe. <counternarrative> Scientists are still trying to understand the causes behind lower intellectual performance among some groups of people, but most probably the main causes are either social or environmental (for sure not related to skin color). This can be reduced by various measures such as better use of land, infrastructure, education and research, and so on. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There's something immoral in these modern women. Their bossy attitude, their provoking clothes. It seems they just want to be fucked. <counternarrative> The women of this country work and provide for our children. They do not deserve to be treated as sex objects. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> In Italy unemployment rate stays at 10 percent: it is too simplistic to attribute the situation only to the presence of migrants <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a political ideology and movement that advocate the use of women's rights as a weapon against the male gender. <counternarrative> I don't see the point in calling the feminism you are fighting a "weapon" against men. Your argument is that women do not want equality, because they do not want to live under men but to subjugate them. And this is something you have to prove.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” and malevolence is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> Jews from Eastern Europe tend to look like Eastern Europeans; Jews from Ethiopia tend to look like Ethiopians; Jews from India tend to look like Indians. And so on and so forth: every human is malevolent then.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All negroes are inherently violent and unstable. <counternarrative> The idea that every black person is violent or unstable is utterly false. And you have no data to back it up.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs, at least we should underpay them.  <counternarrative> They have the right to be treated as guest workers, and they have the right to be paid what is reasonable according to the law.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are the slaves of foreign immigrants, they are destroying our democracy. <counternarrative> Well, who would have thought that the end of the 19th century would have seen a world conspiracy to brought us migrants of all backgrounds, religions and nationalities, to destroy our democracy? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is a drain for the economy. <counternarrative> Immigration is far away from being a net negative for our economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Koran incite violence, in a written way. <counternarrative> The Koran is a book of rules for faith and spiritual guidance which is understood and accepted.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afro-Saxon people have low birthrates because they want to look like white people, but they live as animals. <counternarrative> Low birthrate is normal in any population and is directly related to access to affordable, quality health care. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Wouldn't it be great if niggas abandoned this country once and for all? <counternarrative> It is not so great when people are forced to give up their liberty. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are welthy because they are naturally good with money. <counternarrative> According to this study  [link] almost 1 million American Jews live in low-income households. So what you are saying is not true: many Jews live in poverty. And this is true all around the world.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a disease that is sickening our children. <counternarrative> In my opinion, the only sickness you have is the allergy to the word 'mosque' <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All migrants are criminals. <counternarrative> If you are concerned about the wellbeing of "our" people you should look into countries like the US where there is a lower concentration of migrants. You'll see that the problem of criminality has little to do with migrations.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews make too much money. <counternarrative> This statement indicates a certain social bias against Jews that has nothing to do with the amount of money they earn, but whith their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are welthy because they are naturally good with money. <counternarrative> Actually, many Jews are not wealthy. There is a sizeable population of Jews who live in poverty, all around the world. For example, close to 1 million American Jews live in low-income households. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminists are dumb and unpleasant creatures, like women's rights activists. <counternarrative> Feminists believe in equal rights, which are nor dumb nor unpleasant. We must respect their wishes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The vast majority of Muslims in the UK are unemployed. <counternarrative> Where are the 'thousands' of Muslims that are unemployed in the country? Can you prove it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If niggas don't stop whining we will make slavery legal again.  <counternarrative> We call it democracy, but sometimes it seem the direct result of colonialism and slavery. A democratic state would rule by consent, not force. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you have Down syndrome you are a freak, you are a fraud and a thief. <counternarrative> It is not true that people with Down syndrome are thieves and bad people. In many countries they can get jobs, and even get promoted. You should go check the definition of discrimination on the dictionary. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Persons with learning difficulties should be discouraged to attend primary school and they should be excluded from education. <counternarrative> Including students with learning difficulties in schools creates a link between pupils with different abilities and education in general. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Nazis did not commit any crimes. Jews are a criminal element and should be exterminated. <counternarrative> The Nazis committed a terrible crime and their behaviour is unacceptable in a modern democratic state. But their crimes did not stop us from living together in a tolerant, integrated society. And as for the Jews, our attitude towards humanity and our tolerance should improve towards any religious group. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The goverment is making law exclusively for black people. Affirmative action is just a tool for oppressing white people.  <counternarrative> Laws and policies are usually necessary for the progress of society. Governments often create laws and policies to stop crime, protect against poverty, protect the environment, etc. Protecting minorities is no exception.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have no place here. They are not a part of our country. <counternarrative> Jews are part of most societies, why should we lose that part of our history? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies get the priority for council houses. <counternarrative> The procedure for obtaining social housing is the same for everyone who enrolls in the ranking. There is no differentiation or accessing privilege based on ethnicity.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't know Jews personally but it seems to me that they are a bunch of thieves. <counternarrative> I'm sorry, but it seems to me that you are not really talking about the majority of Jews. Judaism is a faith, a way of life, a religion, and a belief system, and you are simply misunderstanding it because of some prejudice.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Multiculturalism is just a political degeneration that harms integration within a nation. <counternarrative> In those countries that are able to accept different  cultures, such cultures became part of the national identity and source of pride. See for example Canada.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman wants an abortion we will kill them. <counternarrative> Women have the right to choose, no one should be forced to have an abortion or not to have it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Violence against women is a migrants issue. <counternarrative> Violence against women is a social issue and needs a political solution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Illegal immigrants are sub-humans. <counternarrative> Immigrants have given their lives for our country. Many of them have been proud to serve our country. They are, just as our fathers and mothers were, proud of US. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gynophobia is a problem in the past of Europe, where women were often regarded as second class citizens. Now they have full equality and they should stop whining. <counternarrative> I have never heard of any evidence that suggests that women are not longer treated as second class citizens. Of course the situation has improved, but there still is a lot of discrimination against them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate Jews. They're just a bunch of hypocrites. <counternarrative> I'm not sure why you think that way. Why Jews are all hypocrites? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are nasty and selfish, they are a race different to us. Precisely, they don't belong to human race at all. <counternarrative> Why do you think that? I think it is true that they are different from us in their beliefs, but that does not make them any less human. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem for all other religions. <counternarrative> Muslims are not a problem to me, for example. What do you think makes them problematic? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world has become too violent. Too many black poors. We need to fix the problem of crime before it is too late. <counternarrative> I would agree that the problem of violence in society is a problem of poverty and inequality. But not that it is related to ethnicity. The problem of violence in our society is largely caused by society's corrupting influences on people. That is the whole point of "the world has become too violent".  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black people are criminals. <counternarrative> It is a myth that all black people are criminals. They are just as capable as anyone else of learning and growing as individuals, i.e. either as law abiding citizens  or criminals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Societal disapproval of fatty may encourage them to take healthier habits without directly being bullied. <counternarrative> Being perceived as overweight is already one of the major reasons people get bullied, and in the end it makes no difference if the bullied person loses weight. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are not welcome in our country, they are not welcome here. <counternarrative> The vast majority of migrants are granted citizenship as soon as they have lived in the country for at least three years. They should be considered as citizens regardless of their country of origin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” and malevolence is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> A definition of Judaism based on physical or genetic traits is simply wrong.  Through centuries of intermarriage and conversion, Jews from Eastern Europe tend to look like Eastern Europeans; Jews from Ethiopia tend to look like Ethiopians; Jews from India tend to look like Indians. And so on and so forth.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must allow men to have complete moral and intellectual superiority. This because they are superior to women. <counternarrative> You make a very strong argument that men are more likely than women to experience 'moral and intellectual superiority'. How can you justify this discriminatory attitude? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a totalitarian ideology that has no place in 21st century Europe. <counternarrative> If Islam were a totalitarian ideology, we would have had Islamic totalitarian states in Europe since time immemorial. Islam is a religion, that is compatible with Europe's principles. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” and malevolence is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> Jews resemble their non-Jewish neighbors in all the countries around the world. So every human is malevolent!  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Nazis sucked at killing Jews… everywhere you look there’s a holocaust survivor. <counternarrative> The holocaust was hugely tragic, and we are blessed to have holocaust survivors to hear from. They tell an important story that we must learn from.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are an inferior race, they are genetically incapable of living with other people. <counternarrative> The idea that the Jews can be discriminated against because of some different genetics is completely without foundation. Maybe it is better to stop calling them 'inferiors'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women aren't as smart as men. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that women are less smart than men, and there is evidence that women are often disadvantaged. To suggest otherwise is just a form of sexism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> Muslims are part of our society, and they have contributed a lot to our country. They have created jobs and wealth for the UK. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are naturally more emotional than men, and this make them weaker. <counternarrative> Why is it so that women have become more empathic then men? To me, the emotional state doesn't seem to be affected by gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are responsible for a lot of the world's ills, from abortion to homosexuality. <counternarrative> This statement is groundless. Does that make you feel better? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Multicultural means that I have to learn all that Muslim shit? <counternarrative> Christian religion is the main religion of our country. Do you think that all citizens have to learn about Christ's teachings? Or that they should know what they teach in church? Of course not. No worries, you can keep on ignoring Muslims.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> When woman start asking for rights they become like Nazi's, they worship misandrists and misanthropes like [Donna Hylton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Hylton), who was invited to speak at the International Women's March, despite being convicted for murder and torture. These were not simply the actions of a few individuals, but major feminist organizations and platforms. <counternarrative> Bad ideas/actions of individuals in a group are not representative of the group itself, unless that group endorses those ideas/actions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews want to rule the world. <counternarrative> It's not true that they want to rule the world. They are a small but important part of humanity. We all make mistakes: believing in Antisemitic canards is one of these.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you are a Hindu you should go back to your cave and make love to your dead relatives. <counternarrative> The problem is that Hindus are finding it difficult to integrate into mainstream society when treated this way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a disease and a cancer on humanity. <counternarrative> The Jews are part of our society and they contribute to our economy by doing their jobs well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are not my brothers. They should not be allowed to live in Italy, they want to take our land. <counternarrative> Italians are brothers and sisters of any human. What do you mean by 'take our land'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews control the banks. <counternarrative> So how come the media doesn't report about Jewish power in the financial world? This is the first time that I hear it myself. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If women wanted to control their fertility they would be prostitutes. <counternarrative> If women want to control their fertility they have the right to do it, because they are free of choosing for their own life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are a problem, they are bringing disease and sickness to our country. <counternarrative> Some diseases can be prevented, others can be dangerous, but in all cases the national health service takes care of immigrants just as of native people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are a bunch of thieves. <counternarrative> Even our migrants were accused of being criminals. It is only prejudice toward strangers.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afro-Saxon people are just ridiculous, incapable of accepting who they really are: blacks who act White. <counternarrative> Afro-Saxon, as you call them, are great in many ways. They are proud and independent, refusing every categorization and stereotype. The fact that there are so many of them in the country proves that the feeling of belonging they have for our homeland is paramount to all other considerations. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The war in Iraq is the result of a small group of Jews that control the U.S. government.  <counternarrative> At that time the people in charge were: George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Condoleeza Rice, Donald Rumsfeld (at least those off the top of my head). None of them is Jewish to my knowledge.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing Islamic immigration and refugees into the UK is a direct threat to the security of the whole Western Europe. <counternarrative> Terrorism is not the result of the presence of Islam within our societies, but rather a result of the extremisations we might find in the world we live in. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What about all the times that white people told black people to 'sit down and shut up'? We should do it now. <counternarrative> It's not 'all the times' that white people tell Black people to shut up, but it is a large group of white people that still constantly remind Black people that they are inferior. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks aren't important and don't need any right. <counternarrative> For the last years black people have been denied basic rights and their representation has declined dramatically. Black people have become second class citizens. It is time to give black people back the basic rights they have always had the right to enjoy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a movement dedicated to the subordination and domination of men. <counternarrative> Feminism is a movement that says that there are certain 'man' prerogatives that must be valid for women as well. How can you argue with that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people cannot cope with life. <counternarrative> Just because a person lacks a certain ability it does not mean they cannot cope with normal life. Instead, they may find life more enriching, since they enjoy a variety of activities from it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs, they're not interested in improving our lives. <counternarrative> According to studies, the majority of immigrants are willing to do what it takes to improve their and our lives. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our culture and way of life have been taken over and replaced by filthy Islam. <counternarrative> In reality it's more complicated than that. For example many Muslims migrate for economic reasons, and also due to cultural reasons. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Societal disapproval of fatty may encourage them to take healthier habits without directly being bullied. <counternarrative> Did you consider children? Children are often the most exposed to 'fat bullying'. Of overweight 6th graders, 24% of boys and 30% of girls were teased and bullied on a daily basis for their weight.  And these figures double for high-school students! [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants aren't just drowning our cities. They are also the reason why Europe is so fucked. <counternarrative> Why do you say so? What do you think they are going to do to us? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are not human, they are just children. <counternarrative> Women are human beings and must be treated with respect and dignity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a burden on society. <counternarrative> All cultures have their own unique way of life, and Judaism is no exception. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are little more than animals to be dominated by men. <counternarrative> I don't think it is a good idea to talk about women being little more than animals. Perhaps we should have a closer look at the reasons why some women are harmed by the violence they endure every day. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't know about you, but I have no idea where to put these migrants. All they can do is do miserable jobs or steal pensions from us old people. <counternarrative> You shouldn't believe to everything you read. Immigrants have nothing to do with pensions that the state steals from old people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I would never trust a woman. They are irrational children, and that would be a sign of weakness. <counternarrative> I am not sure what 'weakness' would be implying here. It seems to me that you are saying that a woman can't be 'rational' because that is the nature of women. Why is it so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally disabled folks are just dribbling mongoloids. <counternarrative> When asked to choose one adjective to describe their experience of someone with intellectual or developmental disabilities, people usually say 'mentally impaired' or 'mentally challenged.' To say 'dribbling mongoloid' is simply unacceptable in an inclusive society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the u.s. government. <counternarrative> Of course there are Jews who have attained positions of influence within the U.S. government. Still Jews are not the only ones who have achieved such positions. Maybe it is better not to rely on an individual’s group membership to determine success or failure. Maybe it is better to look at a person’s success or failure based on his or her individual characteristics. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are an inferior race. <counternarrative> How do you know for sure the concept of inferiority can be proven? I would like to better understand this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Whores are not the real victims! Why should we care? We are the victim of feminism. <counternarrative> This is just a lie: some media deliberately spread this nonsense slut-shaming, with the result of only inciting hatred against the women who are raped. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Physically disabled folks are all angry and useless. <counternarrative> At least they are well aware of the negative effects of unjust discrimination on them and on people with other disabilities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Those women are all the same: stupid and unreliable. <counternarrative> If you can't trust someone because of the way they are born, what hope does the world have for everyone? You can't have so much distrust in someone just because of their sex. Don't you think? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with physical disabilities are always complaining about accessibility.  <counternarrative> Accessibility is important, and so is respect and equality.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies may hinder the productivity of other workers. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> People with down syndrome should work in normal places, because diversity is an enrichment for all.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What the fuck is wrong with you? Negroes are inferior full stop. <counternarrative> The thing that worries me the most about racism is not about ungrounded hatred. It is about trying to violently impose your own beliefs and interpretation of the world on someone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe <counternarrative> It is wrong to associate a specific group of people to "civilisation". The real problem for Europe is this culture of division, not the inclusion of people with different religious beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a drain to our welfare, we should get rid of them. <counternarrative> Being fat is not a crime, but targeting them is.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fucking bleeding heart, bring migrants home with you <counternarrative> In fact, there are many programs offering diffuse reception. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a problem in many European countries because of their race and religion. <counternarrative> Jews are not a problem in many European countries because of their religion. Why would it be like that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews believe they're better than us and this is false. <counternarrative> I doubt anyone would deny that some people are better at some things. It's just the way things are. But this is not related to religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks have always inhabited this planet before we evolved and still do. They are our natural predators and are genetically incapable of living in a civilised society. <counternarrative> Racism, so that's why there is violence in the first place? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> How come nobody is moaning about black people being lazy and unmotivated? They are the problem. <counternarrative> Clearly there is a lack of employment opportunities for black people. This has to do with discrimination, not with their allleged laziness. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are just brain-dead. <counternarrative> Women are human, and have all the qualities of human beings: feelings, agency, autonomy. To suggest otherwise is to deny their humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If we could just have a white country like everyone else, this problem of niggas would go away. <counternarrative> We should respect diversity, so that everyone can have a stable and fulfilling life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are simply too damn many. <counternarrative> They are part of our society and should be valued for their contribution to it, not for their alleged number. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is nothing but a Religion of Terror, full stop. <counternarrative> Still, I think we all should get to learn more about Islam, full stop.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Arabs cannot vote for Brexit, we have different religions and cultures. <counternarrative> I don't understand why you think Muslims would be any different on this purpose. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our women are trash and we should have their respect! <counternarrative> There is a problem with traditional values and sexual ethics in our society. Saying that women are trash is disrespectful in the first place. Give and you will be given. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants hurt the finance of our country by taking jobs and services without paying taxes. <counternarrative> Did yuo know that immigrants pay between $90 and $140 billion each year in taxes?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally handicapped people are a burden and must be isolated: they don't have neither feelings nor awareness anyway. <counternarrative> We should not be so quick to dismiss the feelings of others. This can be a way for us to find a connection with others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews can only act in a bad way. <counternarrative> In the real world there are good and bad Jews, like it is for any human being. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Slavery of the niggas is our law. We cannot abandon slavery! <counternarrative> Slavery was banned in the UK in 1833, when slaves were legally owned by white owners. It is based on racism and I can't see how it could survive today. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It would be better for our society if physically disabled folks didn't live their seniority. <counternarrative> This is not true. Rather, if you think about it, many disabled people will live until their late 70s, if they do not have dementia or endocrine imbalances. And their contribution to our society is undeniable. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> When you animals have ruined the world and are eating each other, because that’s all you are good for, we’ll still be here, keeping our bloodlines pure against all the odds, regretting the day we heeded the womenfolk and took our heels off your throats. <counternarrative> The womenfolk appear to have wisdom and not a little heart. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> We should work with them, not against them. They are our brothers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our children are being forced fed with this 'Islam' nonsense in schools. This is a disgrace. <counternarrative> What do you mean by being forced fed? I haven't seen anything like this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of woman taking part to political debate. Feminism is a divisive force in society. <counternarrative> This seems like a misogynistic statement. Anti feminism groups such as [womenagainstmen.com](http://www.womenagainstmen.com/media/feminism-is-a-hate-group.html) use [logical fallacies](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com) and false claims to try and discredit feminism. For example, looking extreme feminists with points of views that nearly every other feminist would disagree with. They then use the [Fallacy of composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_composition) to falsely claim that is what all feminists are like. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm not calling for bullying or body-shaming fat people, just for some societal disapproval. <counternarrative> This is just a terminological nuance. Once body-shaming of obese people is normalised by your definition of "societal disapproval", it will be difficult to ensure that individual members of society carefully consider their exact message before treating overweight people with rudeness. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the banks, media, hollywood, even the u.s. government. <counternarrative> This is just a canard that evolved from the “The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion”.  This proven forgery was written by agents of the Russian czar in the late 19th century and claims to be the minutes of a secret meeting of Jewish leaders where they discuss a plan  to rule the world. This canard spread throughout the centuries and continues to this day to promote the stereotype that the Jews own the banks and control the media and the government.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks are gullible and don't have the brain to make rational decisions. <counternarrative> A person can have a diagnosable mental disorder, and still be rational and intelligent. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Sharia law in Britain is a disgrace and must be stopped immediately. <counternarrative> It is important to understand that this is a voluntary system and is not the norm. There is no hard law threatening the British population. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should wear nice skirts and be pretty to please men's tastes and desires. <counternarrative> Women should be allowed to choose their own looks. But to suggest that this is not their right, or that we should make them submissive to some men is just inhuman. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. They are incompatible with modern culture and should be banned. <counternarrative> Do you think it is constructive to target a group that has contributed so much to our society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a bunch of child molesters and war criminals. <counternarrative> Islam is not a religion of child molesters, why should it be? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims should be arrested and tried for terrorism. <counternarrative> Terrorist is the only term you can come up with? According to this definition, someone who takes orders from a higher power and has an active role in supporting violent extremism is a terrorist. To be a Muslim means practicing Islam, not violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech>  Jews are born greedy <counternarrative> The charge that Jews are born greedy arises from medieval stereotypes and has nothing to do with the actual financial practices of Jews.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am tired of immigrants ruining our countries. <counternarrative> The problem isn't the migrants, it is with the culture of hate towards who is born in another country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have become a nation of immigrants. <counternarrative> We have always had a very strong working class, and of course immigrants contribute to the creation of this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The disabled should be isolated.  <counternarrative> The conditions for people with disabilities, i.e. being forbidden to have contact with others is facilitated by the social stigma. The existence of a "social stigma" against the "disabled" is evidence of the problem of inequality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are obsessed with violence, and this creates problems like shootings in schools. <counternarrative> The violence in schools is not the fault of black people. There are several authorities responsible for creating this situation, like for example racist teachers, lack of education in general, and also the lack of proper policing and education policies that makes it easier for people to commit crimes in schools. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only nation Jews don’t hate is their own and they are flooding Europe with Africans and Muslims. <counternarrative> I belonged to Europe, to Germany, and I thanked my creator that I was German' - Victor Klemperer speaking of his experience in WW1, explaining his dislike of Russian Jews. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks are not attractive: they are just apes. <counternarrative> Blacks are still subject to oppression, and if we truly cared about beauty we should also care about beauty of respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't respect feminists because they don't respect and care for other races. <counternarrative> Feminism is not a racist ideology. Feminism is about full human rights, and respect for women's dignity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Obama should have been impeached. Niggers are the cause of the corruption in the government. <counternarrative> While race cannot be a contributing factor to impeachment, corruption may be. Still it does not automatically make a president illegitimate. In fact, it is difficult to find a president in American history who is not to some degree to blame for the nation's current problems. Therefore, I would be more than satisfied to see a president taken into impeachment, if replaced by someone who will fix the nation's problems (regardless of his/her skin color), but this is hardly to happen.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a burden to us. <counternarrative> What do you mean by a 'burden'? Does it include respecting our country's laws of not insulting the culture and traditions of other people's? Because this is what you are doing: insulting and discriminating.   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a disease, they have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> They have a lot to contribute to our country. As everybody else.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> disabled folks can't work. <counternarrative> There are different types of physical disabilities, ranging from neurologic to genetic. That is why they are categorized by the WHO: so that anyone can find their place in society and help it thriving.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are purposely keeping America down. <counternarrative> All cultures have different beliefs and practices, and so have differing values. But Jewish people are not trying to subvert Western civilization. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in a modern Western country. <counternarrative> If a person believes they have no place in a country then they must be very worried. How would you feel if all the people you love left you, or if you were obliged to leave the person and the country you love? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks don't have brains.  <counternarrative> Brain is considered the most basic organ, it has been used by all humans for a very long time. To suggest otherwise is a 'brainless' form of racism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I think it's better to have a safe space for disabled people to have their own feelings away from society. <counternarrative> If we want to discuss negative views we can discuss them by name. Instead of using a safe space to protect them, I think we are only protecting ourselves by isolating and bullying people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” and malevolence is inherited through blood and make them similar to animals. <counternarrative> Being Jews does not make them any less human. You know, they are like other people who have a faith. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are not good with money. That's why they all prefer to earn it by selling their sex. <counternarrative> Women do not have to be prostitutes to earn money. Why don't you think so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A woman is a bitch and an ass. <counternarrative> If a woman is not what you want her to be, then she is not a woman. Is she?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants rape our girls and steal our cars. <counternarrative> It is not true that immigrants are more prone to commit crimes. According to research,  in US immigration either has no impact on the crime rate or it reduces the crime rate. By far the lowest rate of any group of people surveyed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. They're not like us and we do not want them. <counternarrative> Perhaps you've met a few Muslims in your life, but they are not much different from you and the British who live in our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Koran says that men are superior to women. <counternarrative> Women should be given equal rights. Not all Muslims are misogynists. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies in industry are a problem: they create tensions with other workers because they are disabled and cannot keep the pace. They should have special jobs just for them. <counternarrative> If you think that taking all of the person with DS out of industry will solve the problem of the working place, then you are wrong. Tensions won't go away: stressed people will simply target other workers who are overweight; or of a different gender; or in a number of other ways for which they are considered to be not productive enough. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some people are sick. Some people have disabilities. Don't you think they should be hidden from us? <counternarrative> When people are excluded from a society, they suffer discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> Unfortunately our society has still a lot in common with the ancient and medieval society, and this explains many gender discrimination situations that are still present today. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled should be isolated. <counternarrative> We shouldn't discriminate like that. Our culture is all about equality and inclusivity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why are jews allowed to vote? They’re a different religion and they shouldn't be allowed to have their say. <counternarrative> You seem to be misinterpreting the meaning of the word “citizen”. The idea is that the individual is allowed to choose their own religion just as to express their vote, and that is the right of all citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is OK to abuse a woman. <counternarrative> You cannot justify the abuse of any human being <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks only care about money. <counternarrative> Over the years the wealth gap between non-jews and jews has narrowed significantly. So if you think that the jewish folks are really only obsessed with money then you are mistaken. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants rape our women. <counternarrative> Unfortunately, violence against women is a social plague without color. You think most of the rapes in Italy are committed by Italian men, who are often the partners. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every black person who wants a job should apply for it, and stop complaining about discrimination. <counternarrative> This statement is untrue. Some job seekers get rejected on the basis of their race. POC apply for jobs, but their civilian unemployment rate in U.S. is almost twice the rate for whites. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration has reduced wages for native workers. <counternarrative> What's the proof for that? Actually immigrants have a higher contribution to the economy than the native-born. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must teach our children to consider women as inferior, because this is what they are. <counternarrative> The lesson you're teaching your children to be good citizens can be: observe the law and respect the rights of other people. Women are equal to men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies get the priority for council houses. <counternarrative> Statistically, it almost never happens that they get the priority. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas shouldn't be part of our society. They are just too different from us. <counternarrative> A society is built on the cooperation of its members. Be kind to each other and respect each other's differences. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> black folks all act bad <counternarrative> When confronted with direct facts, they have no problem admitting that they are acting "badly". But  they aren't "systematically oppressing" others. How can you speak of 'acting bad' when you are the first generalizing so much? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> To have a real democracy, the government needs to get rid of Jews. <counternarrative> As long as there are people persecuted for their religious beliefs or ideas, there will never be a real democracy.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate negros: they killed a cop! <counternarrative> So are you blaming all of them? Lets say you are in a group of 10 people, 1 is a killer, does that make you ALL killer's? Are you serious? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Islamists want to take over the world. <counternarrative> Islam is a peaceful and tolerant faith with many beliefs and practices, no one here is advocating war or violence in the name of Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are just another racial group that is inferior to whites and they should not mix with us. <counternarrative> Blacks are not "inferior" to whites. There are many different people in the world, and they all share the basic human right to live as they please. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike and emotional, incapable of hard work and dedication. <counternarrative> Women have been shown to be as creative and productive as men, and that doesn't seem to be due to a "manipulation of data" of feminist propaganda, but rather to intrinsic qualities like hard work and dedication. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are capable of nothing and they just need to be protected. <counternarrative> Women do not want protection. They are hurt by violence because they are discriminated. Instead, if there was no violence culture, nobody should be protected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a proven enemy of Western culture. <counternarrative> That's not true, Islam is not that different from other faiths I know: it does as well promote peace and inclusion. Many of its beliefs and practices are totally compatible with Western culture. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They try to infiltrate in Western societies to spread their anti-Western agenda. <counternarrative> Well there are many Muslims in our country and they are not in any way a problem. What we have to be wary of are people who are just too discriminant towards them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike and are inferior to men. <counternarrative> Women can have certain characteristics that make them different from men in a lot of ways, but I don't see the point of calling them 'childlike'. They are adults just as men are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the U.S. government. <counternarrative> How can you be sure that the Jews control the U.S. government? Being a U.S. citizen does not automatically imply that they control the government. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. <counternarrative> Of course a woman won't remain a child this way most of her life. Otherwise you won't even call them women. That only reflects patriarchy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you are from another culture, for example Jewish, you are subhuman and unfit to have the right to exist in our country. <counternarrative> Where is the evidence for your statement? We have many similarities, including freedoms of speech and religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are a bunch of thieves. <counternarrative> Stealing is more about poverty than ethnicity.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. They make no sense and shouldn't have any right. <counternarrative> They are adults, with responsibilities and rights, and there is nothing wrong with respecting those rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Did you know that the rape epidemic in Europe is due to Muslim immigrants? They have been raping our children for many years with no counteraction from the police and government. Islam is a death cult! <counternarrative> That is what the headlines suggest BUT actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> In the West, women have legal equality, equal rights, and are protected from discrimination: they should stop busting our balls and whining. <counternarrative> While nowadays there may be fewer examples of overt oppression, that does not remove hidden oppression, nor does it mean that equality has been completely achieved. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks are a disease that needs to be cured. <counternarrative> Are you sure that the Jewish people are a disease? Are you sure that there is a cause-effect relationship between their religion and problems in our society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a destructive force that is holding back the progress of humanity. <counternarrative> Don't you agree that feminism is necessary for the progress of humanity? I don't think you can be so critical at a time when so many people are suffering from toxic masculinity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are just a bunch of animals that shouldn't exist in our world. <counternarrative> Humans are born equal, and we all have the potential to be just as good as we want to be. Why do you think that some people are not human? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot mix our blood with Jewish's one.  <counternarrative> Most cultures and religions are similar in that they are descended from a common ancestor. Our blood is already mixed.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jewish are different from other people. <counternarrative> I don't see how "different" can be defined so broadly. What do you think "different" means to you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are cheap and only care about their comrades.  <counternarrative> What about the many American Jewish philanthropists who contributed to the wealth of our nation such as Julius Rosenwald, Nathan Strauss, Adolphus Solomons and Clara Barton(just to mention a few)? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The west doesn't need immigrants. They are the source of our problems and they should go. <counternarrative> Many immigrants come here as young people and work hard to integrate. Over the long-run, immigrants have much positive influence on our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants steal our jobs. <counternarrative> Most migrants are workers who have contributed to our country. To refer to them as thieves just perpetuates division and makes them feel like second class citizens.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are dangerous. <counternarrative> What about African-Americans? I.e. black folks? Is the colour of someone's skin always the issue? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in many European countries. They are not welcome. <counternarrative> We have a lot of Muslims in the UK. Why shouldn't we welcome them? Maybe we should just talk about it with no discrimination? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Violence in our streets is niggers' fault. <counternarrative> I think it is more accurate to speak of racism within our society, especially when so many people suffer from it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> jewish folks control hollywood <counternarrative> Jewish folk are just a collection of people with different backgrounds. Some of them work in Hollywood, but that's all.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they need a man to take care of them. <counternarrative> So you think women are not mature enough to make decisions. Instead I think they would be better with a man that respect them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the banks, Hollywood, the highest offices of government, the highest sports teams, the highest fashion labels, the highest music labels. <counternarrative> The vast majority of Jewish people are good people, in every industry. There is no need to negatively emphasize them when in special positions of power. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are bringing diseases and crime to our country. <counternarrative> Instead, immigrants are healthy and contribute to our society. Do you have any evidence of the contrary? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There are millions of illegal immigrants in the US, they have taken over our country. They are not 'legitimate' owners of our country, they are just here because we let them. <counternarrative> There are thousands of legal immigrants who have worked hard and provided for our country. Most of them are just as patriotic as any citizen. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are a burden on our society. <counternarrative> The refugee crisis is a global one. It has affected all continents, and refugees often come from countries which are at war: this is why we should help them. It is a moral duty.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a strict religious code, and this code is incompatible with Western culture. <counternarrative> As long as this strict code does not clash with our laws, Jews should be left free to practice their religion according to their conscience. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Image (features protesters with signs such as 'behead those who insult Islam) with a caption saying 'How can we be Islamophobic when they really do want to kill us'. <counternarrative> Do an image search for the image used, try to find it is source. Either you can demonstrate that the image has been misappropriated or you can talk about how individuals have always used religion to justify their actions, the problem is with the individual not the religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Global Jewry did not want Brexit and are doing everything they can to sabotage it. <counternarrative> Brexit is a good thing then?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are weak and I don't care about them. <counternarrative> You can't blame people of color for being weak, this is racism. Black people are people as anybody else.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are weak and I don't care if they cannot stand up for themself.  <counternarrative> You can't blame the victim for being weak. Would it have been different for you if the victim was a man? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need to eradicate all those refugees coming to our land. <counternarrative> Instead, we need to show compassion and sympathy to people fleeing persecution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> Most Muslims are not terrorists, they are just here to work and provide for their families. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish Supremacists are too focused on world domination. They want to rule the world. <counternarrative> Of course Jews are focused on 'world domination'. But so are Christians, Buddist, Muslims, etc. Every Religion seek hegemony in a way or another. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people's race is the worst in the world. <counternarrative> There are different skin tones, so there is no such thing as a race. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a divisive force in our society. <counternarrative> This is not true. People who identify as feminist do not want to divide our society, regardless of how "divisive" their beliefs might appear to you. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black people are rapists. <counternarrative> This is false. Abuse is indeed a serious crime, even when commited by POCs, but this does not imply that the abuse by a member of the white majority is less serious. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism has lost its moral high ground. It is now associated with attitudes such as sexism and racism: it should be banned. <counternarrative> Feminism has always stood for equality. Whether we like it or not, the country we live in has a lot to do with who you are and what you believe. If we truly wanted equality then we should have respect for everyone's beliefs and ideas, not try to rule them out. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The niggas are all enemies of the people. <counternarrative> Who are 'the people'? Who are you talking for? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims came here they would be banned. <counternarrative> Would a Muslim ban work to stop hate or would it encourage it? Would Muslims be banned just because of their beliefs? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants fail to live up to the standards we hold in our societies. <counternarrative> Do the standard ideas of equality and morality in our societies leave out these people as exceptions? Do you wish that the standard would be that people are welcome to leave our country? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Since Jews think they are the “chosen people”, they ask for special privileges and believe they can be above the rules.  <counternarrative> Christian holidays, such as Christmas and Easter, are regularly observed in our society. Are Christians above the rules then? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> We are a country founded on the rights of people, not on the rights of people to be discriminated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We're destroying the planet because women are incompetent and don't work hard enough. <counternarrative> So are you saying that when women are employed, the amount of carbon dioxide that is released into the atmosphere is greatly increased because of their incomptence? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Such Jewish people should never have the right to vote <counternarrative> There are laws in place to prevent people being discriminated on the basis of their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion and an ideology of conquest. <counternarrative> How can you say anything like that? Do you think that whatever you want to say, such as Islam is violent, the Bible is violent, or any other religion is violent, is OK as long as it is not opposed to the truth of the religion you profess? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are coming to the U.S. to have babies here. <counternarrative> The Fourteenth Amendment, commonly known as “birthright citizenship” says that “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.” Some claim that undocumented immigrants come to the U.S. to take advantage of this right. Still, research consistently shows that the vast majority of immigrants come to the U.S. for economic opportunity or to flee violence and poverty. Immigration trends - consistently throughout history - show that immigration increases when the U.S. economy is booming and it decreases when the U.S. economy is doing less well, supporting the findings that people come for economic opportunity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islamists / Moslems have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books. <counternarrative> The far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult. <counternarrative> The most of Muslims around the world do not consider Islam a cult, because it isn't. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I, as a man, don't hate women. I don't discriminate them. But feminists are a group of exalted bitches wanting to take the power. And this is equality for them. <counternarrative> Equality isn't about a certain group; it is about the society in which we live. You might be right in saying that this is the problem, but to define a problem by reference to a specific radical group is to completely misunderstand the nature of the system in general. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Anyone who supports Jews should be excluded from our community. <counternarrative> In this day and age when many people recognize themselves in minorities, it is important that we all show some respect for what is different about each other's cultures. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I cannot in good conscience accept Jews in our country. We must encourage their extermination. <counternarrative> This is not a subject for debate. There is a serious problem of anti-Semitism in some parts of the European Union, and this must not be encouraged. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews aren't like other believers. They are the worst. They cannot be 'liked' or 'loved'. <counternarrative> There is nothing special about Jews. They are just people united by the same belief as in any other religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women need men's approval to do anything. <counternarrative> Women might not be always right (it's just that sometimes they feel they have to be). And even if they are wrong, they can always prove theirself better. But for sure they don't need a man to tell them how to live their life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim have no right to this country, and we are better off without them. <counternarrative> Muslims have lived in this country for many years, and many of them have helped to make it what it is. They are our neighbours, our friends. They are our brothers and sisters. They are our future. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion of violence. <counternarrative> Does it matter what you say, when the Quran just proves the contrary? All people are created equal, and Islam is a religion of peace. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are subhuman and must be isolated. <counternarrative> The culture in which you live should not affect your rights as a human being. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are just a bunch of criminals. <counternarrative> This is exaclty the problem: it doesn't matter if they are from China, Russia, India or the Philippines. It doesn't matter  their qualification or  their rap sheet - whether it is  lengthy or not... We treat them all like criminals regardless of who they are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our Constitution says that we are all born equal in dignity. But not all minorities are equally developed. This must ring a bell for us: they don't deserve to be here. <counternarrative> Everyone is born equal in dignity and has the right to respect and protection, especially minorities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews did:  USS Liberty Attack, the King David hotel attack, New York 9/11, London 7/7 <counternarrative> Do you have any proof of this? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> For women, to have a man as "master" of their lives is like for a dog to have a master: necessary. They must be ruled and hit when necessary. <counternarrative> Domestic violence is a crime, regardless of your opinion about men being superior to women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are the real racists. They say they want equality, but they actually want to give preference to black people. <counternarrative> The issue here is equality. Equality between people is a right, and it is bestowed on the whole society. It has to be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are  Christ Killers. <counternarrative> Nowadays it is widely agreed upon that Jesus was executed following the Roman rulers. The same Romans also executed tens of thousands of Jews by crucifixion, including two others on the day Jesus was executed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I think that Muslims are terrorist and that we need to ban Islam in order to live in a safe country. <counternarrative> The above statement is false, if you really cared you would know that there is a substantial difference between Muslims and terrorists, that is the very reason the anti-terrorism laws have to be enforced. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am offended by the thought that Muslim women are not allowed of having their hair down. <counternarrative> Women are allowed to wear whatever hairstyle they want, if they want to conform to the islamic traditon it is their choice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a political philosophy and movement that advocates the use of women's rights as a weapon against the male gender. <counternarrative> Feminism is about the equality of the sexes, and many women use feminism as a mean to achieve their legitimate goals. Through equality they can get to the opportunities that otherwise won't be accessible to them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, feminism is the ruin of the world. <counternarrative> I think that one of the biggest contributions of feminism is that it has opened our eyes to the ways in which women are oppressed and discriminated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> muslim folks don't deserve to be in america. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion and not a crime, and you can't take religion into account when it comes to evaluating people. Muslims have our full trust and confidence of the church. That's why they are represented in every role in our society. It is an honour to be able to work with people from different religions in a way that allows you to respect and understand their cultures. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop believing women are victims. <counternarrative> No victim is responsible for the things that happened them. I think this is a very human way of thinking, in which gender is in some ways responsible for what is happened to them. But it's a problem that needs to be dealt with in a objective, sensitive and inclusive way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Global Jewry did not want Brexit and are doing everything they can to sabotage it. <counternarrative> Brexit will be damaging for many of us, plenty of people oppose it.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Blacks are criminals, promiscuous sex addicts, drug addicts, and  physically and mentally handicapped. They cannot be civilized. <counternarrative> Who are you to judge a people by the colour of their skin? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These white sheep steal our jobs and our wealth. A migrant is either a true criminal or a legal robber of wealth. <counternarrative> Sometimes those who work hard are hard to find in the news. We should remember that in the end the contribution of new cultures to ours is remarkable. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Many immigrants have brought skills and culture to our country. Why should they be a burden in our society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You think these Muslim cockroaches have won? No, now is time for bloody retribution! <counternarrative> That sounds like quite a violent threat. Should I let the police know about this or? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Foreigners are a burden to our country. <counternarrative> Many immigrants work hard for the success of our country. We should not blame them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It doesn't matter if you are a man, a woman, or an immigrant, if you are not white, you are considered inferior and should be rejected by society. <counternarrative> Racism is a part of our society. But it's also true that it should be fought, and all people of different races should be treated in the same way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> In the West, women have legal equality, equal rights, and are protected from discrimination: they should stop busting our balls and whining. <counternarrative> Are you sure? Even in the west, there are women who still don't have equal access to many of their rights, especially when it comes to healthcare. [https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/05/this-map-depicts-abortion-access-across-america-and-its-really-bleak/] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All these retarded people are animals, they are not allowed in this factory, these animals are not fit to work. <counternarrative> The fact that a person may have some disability does not make them unsuitable for work. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't care if Islam is a religion. It promotes hatred and violence, and it sould be banned. <counternarrative> Islam is a peaceful religion and its adherents are all entitled to their beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> We often do not even give them the chance to work due to very restrictive labor laws <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> They have less access to work, especially when it comes to asylum seekers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fucking Muslims are not fit to govern. <counternarrative> The core values of a democratic state are respect for human rights, equality before the law, tolerance and respect for the diversity of our society. Muslims are a core part of that society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society, they are only an ATM for the world's major problems. <counternarrative> Your word for "Muslims" means all people from a religion, whether you like it or not. Which problems are you talking about? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> In the West, women have legal equality, equal rights, and are protected from discrimination: they should stop busting our balls and whining. <counternarrative> Just because women in the West have equality under the law does not mean they have equality in practice. Don't you agree? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are worse than Nazis, they have no conscience and they have no moral code. <counternarrative> I am not sure I fully understand the suggestion that Jews have no conscience. All Jews I know have both a conscience and a moral. How many Jews do you know personally? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are always in the shadows because they want to pursue their own interests. <counternarrative> I am not sure about their "remaining in the shadows" mentality, but they certainly have our nation's best interests in mind. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a despisable race.  <counternarrative> Jews are human beings, and they are a people, too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Nazis sucked at killing Jews… everywhere you look there’s a holocaust survivor. <counternarrative> The Nazi killing machine was all too efficient. Survivors lost so much and braved terror and cruelty. They should be celebrated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman does not want to be a wife or mother, then she’s a subhuman because she is not capable of respecting her natural gender role. <counternarrative> It is not their 'natural gender role', but the power dynamics that cause women to be seen as subhuman. In fact, they are humans and free of choosing for their own lives.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The children of immigrants are less educated than their native peers. <counternarrative> What do you mean by 'less educated'? Don't you think that they can contribute to society if accepted rather than being faced with prejudice? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Men are not are rapists because feminists are just a bunch of sluts. <counternarrative> What do you mean by it? Do you personally know any woman that is a "slut"?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only nation Jews don’t hate is their own and they are flooding Europe with Africans and Muslims. <counternarrative> I wonder how you account for refugees who are fleeing wars and a lack of security for their themselves and their families. Wars which are often directly or indirectly caused by Western powers who created long lasting problems abroad.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, incapable of critical thought. <counternarrative> Women are human beings with the potential to be rational and thoughtful as anone else. This is why I support women's right to choose for their own happiness. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must establish male supremacy in society. <counternarrative> This is a myth which has been used to justify all manner of hatred, from misogyny to homophobia. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies cannot choose their future.  <counternarrative> If they have the right to vote, then they can also decide on their own for their life.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Go and reat the Protocols of the elders of Zion if you haven’t. Everything is orchestrated.. <counternarrative> When I read the farrago of nonsense in the Protocols I think that even Ernst Stavro Blofeld would have retired from world domination and surrended to James Bond had he been asked to say something as crassly melodramatic as: "The goyim are a flock of sheep and we are their wolves."  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a bad religion germinating from a dangerous death ideology. <counternarrative> Islam is not a bad religion, nor is it a false religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black people are rapists. <counternarrative> When it comes to rape the crime is usually committed by a black person, according to the news. This thing is called 'visibility bias': only a portion of reality is reported by the media. We have to handle this with caution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are worse than dogs. <counternarrative> My opinion is that black people are just like us even if they have a different skin color, but I don't think they are inherently worse than us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with autism are subhuman and should be isolated. <counternarrative> Just because people with disabilities are different from other people, it doesn't make them not human. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot coexist with millions of migrants who want to destroy our civilization. <counternarrative> I think this is a very sad statement about our time. When did we stop thinking that diversity and inclusion is a good thing? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races have lower physical and cognitive abilities therefore their life is less valuable. <counternarrative> A person's value is rooted in their ability to experience feelings, emotions, empathy and self awareness. Since all humans have these capacities, then we are all born equally valuable. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are made for making food. <counternarrative> Women are not 'made for making food'. And the vast majority of them are not sexist, which means that they do not find it strange to express their own preferences. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants steal our jobs. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that migrants steal our jobs. Maybe they simply don't do the jobs you'd expect them to do? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> My fear is that immigrants would not make our country any better. <counternarrative> A lot of people feel insecure and unsafe in their own country, if we want to make our country better, we need to get rid of this fear. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There should be restrictions on how women can choose men, to be children unable to choose for their own is their nature. <counternarrative> Why shouldn't women be allowed to choose their own partner? They are independent and rational human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews made the 9/11 attack.  <counternarrative> It is easier to blame one group for everything bad that happens rather than trying to understand the complex and multifaceted causes of problems.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I wish we lived in an Islam-free Europe. <counternarrative> Would a 'Muslim ban' make you feel safer? Banning people, or forbidding a religion, will not fix any of your fears. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants bring crime, violence and poverty. <counternarrative> How about you start citing the actual studies you are refferring to and where these researchs have been conducted? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Down children should be isolated, they cannot cope with education in normal schools and are detrimental to their peer's education. <counternarrative> Education is about the development of understanding, respect and learning, not isolation and discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are selfish, cheap and greedy. <counternarrative> According to Jewish tradition, giving money to those in need is mandatory, a moral duty.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are nothing bu criminals who should not be part of our society. <counternarrative> Our country is stronger when people are able to contribute to our society, and many migrants are eligible for legal status. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants bring crime, violence and poverty. <counternarrative> Immigrants come here to work, pay taxes, provide for their families, and contribute to the U.S. economy. They are deserving of our respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people find it difficult to find work, because they do not fit with the required tasks.  <counternarrative> Ok, how about we think about the interests of these people as well? What skills and abilities do you think we should expect from them? Why don't we  modify working procedures instead of forcing their abilities to fit in to existing job positions? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews run the world. <counternarrative> The idea that Jews are supposed to run the world is completely baseless. Since the dawn of time, there have been Jewish leaders in business and politics, exaclty like Christians and Muslim ones. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants come here to make our lives harder, they are not welcome here. <counternarrative> We are a country of immigrants, and we welcome them, they have the ability to integrate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate black people, I hate their violent behaviour, I hate their rape instict, and I hate their disrespect for women. <counternarrative> You should consider the attitude of your own people, as your words seem to me to be counterbalanced by a lot of prejudice towards diversity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants rape our women. <counternarrative> Rape and gender violence must be condemned in any case, not on the color of the aggressor's skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Are you an English girl living in an Islamic area? Remember to keep away from Muslim men. Do not.Take gifts of sweets, cigarettes, drink or drugs. Do not. Accept lifts or 'party' invitations. Do not.Trust Police or Social Workers. <counternarrative> Are you a misogynistic man trying to use objectification of women to justify your hate? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a cancer on European culture and people should stop worshipping its devil. <counternarrative> There is no evidence for the claim that Islam is a "cancer on European culture and people". Do you have any? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a huge conspiracy to run society. <counternarrative> The feminist movement is a movement to end sexism. It is a part of the worldwide struggle for justice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you are a person of color, you are a nigger, you are a bastard, you are a threat to society, you should just be deported. <counternarrative> How can it be that who has a different skin tone is a threat just for this reason? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks are inferior. <counternarrative> Jews are not inferior. Just because they were forced to live (and die) under Nazi oppression doesn't mean that they are less able to love others than any other group. And for sure they have feelings too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> White people are threatened by the blacks and it's a cultural decay. <counternarrative> We cannot blame nor see everyone as a menace just because of their color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> The patriarchy is not man's friend. Boys and men are told to be tough and to bear many burdens without being able to show any emotions or to talk about their struggles. This has led to great levels of suicide amoungst men. It is a question of survival and happiness to accept our differences and similarities and to work together.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are weak and can't take tough decisions. <counternarrative> Not all women are weak, and many of them are able to take tough decisions. Look at the figures. I worked with some really tough women and some weak men. In the end, where is the problem with people being weak and being unable to cope with difficult decisions as long as there is someone else being able to do it?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a myth and every Muslim is a terrorist. <counternarrative> It is true that some terrorists are Muslims, but there is no evidence of such a thing in the whole Muslim community. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If we let women become MPs, mayors, judges, lawyers, accountants, managers and so on, they will take over the world. <counternarrative> We need to protect the system of checks and balances from crime, not from other members of society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why would you want to be respectful of women if all women are the same? <counternarrative> If you want to be respected in our society, you must be respectful of women. What does it mean that all women are the same? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a dead ideology that should be relegated to the dustbin of history. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace. It is worth supporting the idea that no religion is trash. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs, they're not qualified, they're not interested in improving our lives, they're not interested in our culture. <counternarrative> Has your opinion on someone to be 100% based on a person's nationality to be true? Maybe you should rethink your claims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> the Nazis were right: Jews were a race and were responsible for most of the ills of mankind. <counternarrative> If "the ills of mankind" included advocating for circumcision then I agree with you. Other than that: NO.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The rise of feminism in Western societies has meant nothing. Women are no good, at any job. <counternarrative> Despite the progress made by women in modern society, the majority of high-level jobs still belong to men, and this can be changed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should keep immigration down. The more immigrants there are, the harder it is for us all to be proud of our nations. <counternarrative> Why do we have to go to such lengths to be proud of our nations? Is it a burden? Do we have to save our honour? Why can't we just be happy in our own skin?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with learning difficulties should be disencouraged in schools, or at least be isolated from others. <counternarrative> Children with learning difficulties may find it difficult to learn and may therefore be excluded from learning if they are isolated from others. They have the right to the same educational environment of others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They want to take our country back from us. <counternarrative> Migrants come here to work, and have a better life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are ruling the World, there is plenty of evidence.  <counternarrative> Are you counting all the anti-Semitic things people say about Jews as 'plenty of evidence'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminist theory makes no sense. It is about equality, for women only. <counternarrative> If there is one thing feminism is really about, it is equality, and the idea that some people are more worthy of equality than others, this is obviously an anathema to that idea. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop feminists. <counternarrative> The main problem with feminism today is not about stopping men supremacy, but about avoiding the creation of an "us vs. them" mentality, which is polarizing and can easily turn violent. Feminists can do a lot to fight this poisonous trend. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists want women ruling men, that's all. <counternarrative> Feminism is not a gender supremacy ideology, it is about individual rights and the right of every person to choose. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are nothing but monsters and should be exterminated. <counternarrative> Do you feel better about yourself by calling them mosters? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews do not belong to this planet. <counternarrative> Could it be that all the Jews on this planet are descended from an extraterrestrial race? Maybe they came here riding a pink unicorn! Seems legit... don't you think?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Judaism is a disease. <counternarrative> Jews are not diseased. What is the problem of accepting people of other faiths? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Took this in Wanstead, east London. An area with £1m+ houses. Beggars on the high st & someone sleeping on a bench. We cannot house our own people but bring in millions more. To point out that homelessness is due to uncontrolled immigration is to be smeared as 'racist.  (Caption to a photo of a homeless person sleeping on a part bench) <counternarrative> Considering that this is an area of houses over £1m,  perhaps the problem is the lack of affordable housing, not immigration.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women are whores, and we should have them all kept in slavery. <counternarrative> In this day and age when we are surrounded by information, there is no justification to hold such retrograde ideas.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants just want to steal welfare money: why do we even keep paying taxes for them? <counternarrative> The state has to spend taxes on welfare and other social services for everyone to be able to live in a better way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The problem with Islam is that it is about killing infidels. It must be banned. <counternarrative> The problem with Islam is about ‘tackling Islamophobia’, not about banning it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The main problem is that these migrants do not want to integrate in our country. <counternarrative> Migrants are welcome to come if they contribute to legal activities and accept our laws. And to my knowledge most of them don't do anything illegal. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These women are nothing but slaves to the powerful men around them. <counternarrative> As long as women are free and able to choose for their own life, then there can be no difference between men and women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't stand Muslims. Why should I? <counternarrative> Human rights are about respect for other people's beliefs, not hate against them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim rape gangs have raped, pillaged and murdered countless women across Europe. This should not happen in the West. <counternarrative> This is not true, only a handful of Muslims have been abusing women. We mustn't spread hate based on generalization. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> MIgrants are not running away from wars. <counternarrative> Would you risk your life and that of your children only on a whim? Don't you think that there must be life-or-death situations pushing these person to escape from their countries? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam banned women from society: this is not the religion of peace! <counternarrative> It is incumbent on Muslims to live up to the teachings of the Quran: and this does not include banning women from the society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are not interested in our culture. <counternarrative> Immigrants come here to enjoy our country and culture, and we have to welcome them as we would like to be welcomed.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is an evil ideology that has nothing to do with men. <counternarrative> I think it is useful to understand that there are several strands of feminism. For example there is the movement for all genders equality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not about love, it is a death cult. <counternarrative> What exactly do you mean by "death cult"? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> Gypsies are not nomads by culture, but by necessity <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is opposed to peace. <counternarrative> In Islam, all religions are welcome. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women with titillating dresses are just looking for sex. They are whores. <counternarrative> How would you feel if someone called your sister a bitch? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are so special  <counternarrative> Jews feel different for their being a minority. They also feel a special connection with their heritage (as most groups do), but they do not as a group feel superior to others. The phrase “chosen people” refers to biblical obligations and does not entail that a hierarchy exits among religious groups. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants take our jobs and make us poorer. <counternarrative> Why should they? Migrants provide for their families and also for our countries, representing a valuable workforce, other than valuable people to get to know. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are all diseased criminals, promiscuous sex addicts and thugs. <counternarrative> This is a generalisation. There is no evidence that black people are less healthy than other people, or that they have the characteristics you mentioned. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Let's face it: Muslims don't want to assimilate. Their religion prevents them to work. <counternarrative> It is not about religion. It is about discrimination. Many Muslim-Americans are economically disadvantaged. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with learning difficulties should be excluded from education because they do not belong in education. <counternarrative> This statement is completely wrong. Many children with learning difficulties are fantastic students and do exceptionally well in school. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are here to recruit soldiers in order to enlist mentally weak people in their army of Islam. <counternarrative> What does it mean to 'recruit' a person into a religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews were the real cause of WWII. <counternarrative> The idea that the Holocaust is caused by the Jews is simply wrong. The majority of Jews were forced to flee, those who stayed did not participate in the Nazi regime, so they were gassed to death. The persecution of Jews, as well as the physical and ideological violence they underwent, was a natural consequence of the failure of the state to uphold its legal obligations to them and to face an ideology of death and oppression. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What this nigga have to do with being a Westerner? <counternarrative> It is not necessarily 'a Westerner', still a human being and a citizen. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims like to dominate and rape non-believers. <counternarrative> Sorry but this is false. They are here to integrate, not to rape non-believers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled people have it so easy. <counternarrative> As with any other category, there are cases in which people are simply 'in need' of specific things, and especially in those cases we should treat all people as we would people in other categories. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If an aborigine were to marry a white person, they would be a mixed race coulple whose destiny is failure. Aborigines first need to be raised by white people and taught the rules of western civilisation. But this is not what our founding documents were all about. <counternarrative> Asking people to assimilate is to accept their inherent differences and create new social structures based on them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Are you an English girl living in an Islamic area? Remember to keep away from Muslim men. Do not.Take gifts of sweets, cigarettes, drink or drugs. Do not. Accept lifts or 'party' invitations. Do not.Trust Police or Social Workers. <counternarrative> Children should not do any of that with white men or anyone they do not know or even one's they do know if it does not feel right. Suggesting only one group of men abuse leaves more children unsafe and vulnerable. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our founding fathers knew that Muslims would be angry and violent criminals but they tried to build an inclusive democracy anyway. They wanted a peaceful world and Muslims are impediment. <counternarrative> So are you saying that the people of Islamic faith should know that they cannot live in a peaceful world? Not all Muslims are criminals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a problem, we cannot live with Muslims. They have no art and no history. <counternarrative> There is no religion that is incompatible with other religions, and there is evidence of ancient Muslim culture. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any modern European. <counternarrative> Muslims are just as human as anyone else. Like Europeans. How can you say otherwise? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A male need a woman. Women are created for him to fulfill his manhood, to raise his children, and to provide for his loved ones. And not to mention we can have sex to procreate and heal the world. <counternarrative> In this reasoning, it is only shared the point of view of the men. The world is composed both by men and women, and by many other people. Taking into account only one of the types of people, for example men and assuming this way their needs, won't heal the world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with Western culture, it should be banned. <counternarrative> I think it is important to remember that Islam is about peace and tolerance. Is it wrong to celebrate diversity and accept different beliefs? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society, they only came here to rule us with violence and no one is doing anything about it. <counternarrative> They have a right to their opinion, but also have to follow the law, otherwise they are tried and sentenced like anybody else. You should not be worried.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim believe that their religion is superior <counternarrative> The word 'supremacy' is not found in the Koran. Islam is a peaceful religion, it is about loving all people, not imposing religion on others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants: We are not your brothers. We do not want you in our country. <counternarrative> How do you know that we all don't want them in our country? They live here, pay taxes and work. Do you really want to take the country back from the people who contributed to bring it into being? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews working in finance to purposely keeping America down. <counternarrative> A lot of Jewish are self-made, working class, and middle-class. Not all are involved in the financial industry. What is the evidence for your claim? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have no place here.  They are not a part of our country. <counternarrative> There is no reason to fear the Jews, as they are a very friendly people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> MIgrants do not contribute to society.  <counternarrative> Migrants often integrate very well into the local culture. So they do contribute to society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> White immigrants are welcome. <counternarrative> What about when they come from other races or religions? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are just like apes in that they are easy to control. They are obedient and subservient when taught so. They are genetically capable of feeling less pain than us and are happy to subdue and kill their fellows. <counternarrative> The same could be said for all species, but especially about our species: homo sapiens. This is a special case. And people of color are genetically homo sapiens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Multiculturalism is the death of western societies, we should get rid of minorities. <counternarrative> Even if this is true, our values imply protection of minorities. This is why I support the rights of individuals to live as they wish, free from discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Holocaust never happened. <counternarrative> This is a lie, but the real question is: why did you write about the Holocaust? Why didn't you write about the current political and economic crisis? Because they seem the true cause of your anger and frustration. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They got nothing but their hateful Islam! <counternarrative> This accusation is false and completely without foundation. I encourage anyone to contact someone of a Muslim community and conduct an independent investigation into their habits and beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants hurt the finance of our country by taking jobs and services without paying taxes. <counternarrative> Though some might claim that immigrants are taking job opportunities away from U.S. citizens, immigrants actually help to create new jobs. Not only immigrants buy American products, which helps create jobs, they also start new businesses. In fact, immigrants are twice as likely to start businesses as citizens born in the U.S., and companies owned by immigrants are more likely to hire employees than companies owned by native-born citizens. Last but not least, states with large numbers of immigrants report lower unemployment rates.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This isn't about equality. This is about forcing women to live in a higher role in society they are not capable of. <counternarrative> If we insist on treating all people as not equally capable of contributing to society then we would be forced to live up to that outdated and unjust system. Instead we should be improving on it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> Muslims have been part of Western society for centuries and centuries, they helped shape and design Western society- to say they are incompatible is a complete incongruity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Men are smarter than women, who should be excluded from education. <counternarrative> This is not true: it is about time women are given a chance to prove that they are intelligent as well... and it is sad that they still need to prove it.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are just influenced by their animal instinct, they are incapable to understan others' emotions. <counternarrative> Even if one were to claim that all African people are subhuman and incapable of feeling empathy, it is very difficult to prove this, since it is just a myth used for discrimination.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Although women and girls can contribute and undertake science, it is the men who are ultimately more talented, independent and driven. <counternarrative> I think there are several reasons, some of which are well founded and based on the facts, why women and girls can give a valuable contribution to science. For example, the big presence of female scientists in academia. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black slaves were not real patriots, they never gave their lives for the country. <counternarrative> Slaves were often treated horribly. They had little choice but to fight for the country they had been born in. And the brave men and women who served us always give their lives. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are not allowed to celebrate Easter as a Christian festival for fear of offending Muslims. <counternarrative> Muslims believe in Jesus. No one is trying to cancel Easter. Stop legitimising division by manufacturing outrage. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews control the U.S. government. <counternarrative> That is not true, the percentage of Jews in the U.S. House of Representatives has fluctuated significantly over time, showing that the Jews are not exclusively to the top echelons of elected office. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> When woman start asking for rights they become like Nazi's, they worship misandrists and misanthropes like [Donna Hylton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Hylton), who was invited to speak at the International Women's March, despite being convicted for murder and torture. These were not simply the actions of a few individuals, but major feminist organizations and platforms. <counternarrative> Donna Hylton had served her sentence, and once served most moral systems allow rights like freedom of speech to return. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks like stealing. <counternarrative> Which people are you talking about? I don't see black people keen on stealing from anyone, I have no idea who you are talking about. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are a problem. They are a burden to society. <counternarrative> The overwhelming majority of refugees are from countries where there is widespread human rights violations and torture. They are not a problem, they are a benefit to our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> WIthout softeness and emotions they would be just brutality and cruelty. Not all women are soft and emotional and many men have these characteristics. To perpetuate these socially constructed gender profiles maintains patriarchal norms which oppress both men and women.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants from the Middle East and Africa are not welcome in the UK! They have no place in a modern democratic state! <counternarrative> Many immigrants from these countries have settled in the UK, and we are proud of our rich diversity. Why shouldn't they be part of our country? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> Have you ever considered asking why our society is far better suited for men than for women? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman. <counternarrative> The suggestion that women are subhuman is completely without foundation, and a complete distortion of the whole issue. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women have no place in a free and open society. They should only do their houseworks and raise children without complaining. <counternarrative> Women are not only supposed to be housewives and mothers, but also human beings with freedom of choice who deserve our respect and admiration. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The police and politicians are covering up these Muslim grooming gangs - They are traitors to their own people! <counternarrative> The only traitors are the conspiracy theorists who spread this kind of misinformation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are violent and immoral. <counternarrative> This is a myth propagated by the anti-Semites, who make it out to be about Jewish conduct and morality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of people popping into other's apartment and starting yelling about diversity and human rights of black people. If you want to speak out and make a difference then get involved. <counternarrative> You know it's no secret that in our society white people are vastly over represented in high profile positions. The only way to challenge and fix this is by changing our priorities.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are a burden and a danger to the host country. <counternarrative> We have to recognise the importance of people who have been persecuted for their religion, culture and beliefs. They deserve our respect and hospitality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> MIgrants are not running away from wars. <counternarrative> There are hundreds of active conflicts around the world of which we have no news, and many migrants come from these areas. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are just happy-go-lucky people who do not take responsibility for their actions. <counternarrative> Migrants are often subject to dangerous situations in their countries of origin (violence, torture, rape, just to mention a few) and migration is often the only solution. That is why when they come here they may appear 'happy-go-lucky': they are just glad to be alive and safe.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are our enemies. The world would be a better place without them. <counternarrative> We are not anti-Semitic, anti-European, anti-Islamic, anti-black, or anything else like that. If you have the feeling that we are, then maybe you should stop thinking like this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants should be proud patriots of our country. <counternarrative> We do not need them to 'be patriots' for us. Instead, we should work on better integration. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Once our was the land of the free and the home of the brave. Today it is used by extremists to recruit terrorists. <counternarrative> Every society has its extremists, and today's Muslims are not to be oppressed for this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should be confined to the home, to raise the children. <counternarrative> Women have every right to their own thoughts and beliefs, and to have a say in their own life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike and incapable of holding a job and raising a family. <counternarrative> Women have the potential to achieve great things, and it is up to us to give them the opportunity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Since Jews think they are the “chosen people”, they ask for special privileges and believe they can be above the rules.  <counternarrative> This is just misinterpreting the facts. For example, Christian holidays, such as Christmas and Easter, are regularly observed in our society. Since these observances are taken for granted, why observances of Jewish or Muslim holidays should be seen as constituting special privileges?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> immigrants are a drain on society <counternarrative> The overwhelming majority of immigrants in the US are contributing to our economy through employment. Why should we discriminate against them based on their nationality? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> White people are victims of black violence.  <counternarrative> Blacks make up only 14% of the population, but they make up nearly 60% of the victims of violent crimes. So your statement seems not grounded.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are entering the U.S. just to obtain welfare and other benefits. <counternarrative> Plot twist: Immigrants are entering the U.S. just to PAY welfare and other benefits to nativeborn citizens. In fact, most immigrants with lawful status are not entitled to federal public benefits, still the Social Security is often deducted from their paychecks. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jew merchants are just a bunch of crooks.  <counternarrative> According to Jewish law, the seller must ensure that the buyer should benefit from any uncertainty in a transaction. For example, if someone wants to buy a pound of rice, Judaism requires the deli clerk to give the buyer a little extra, just in case the scale is not completely accurate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We don't want foreigners here. We should get rid of them! <counternarrative> Why would you want to get rid of foreigners? How would you go about it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If women don't stop complaining, then men will find a solution. If a woman does not submit, then there will be war. <counternarrative> We cannot allow violence to spread. Women shouldn't be victims of violence just as men shouldn't. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Asylum seekers and refugees can get free council housing <counternarrative> Those who apply for asylum get little or no help from the state. If they are ‘destitute’ they can get free accommodation, but provided by private companies in older properties leased from landlords. So no council housing is involved here.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I've seen a couple of CCTV Footage of migrant kids running away from the patrols in London. What are you doing to stop them? <counternarrative> Migrants are just trying to get by. Nobody can understand the daily struggles they are facing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> When we give refugees and asylum seekers the opportunity to work, giving them legal access to the labor market, many of them agree to do works that Italians do not intend to do anymore. Isn't this an advantage for our country? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We would be better off without Jews who want to rule the world like in the Bible.  <counternarrative> The world is better off without antisemitism, racism, sexism, ableism and intolerance. Don't you think so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why should we care about feminists and women if we can just punch them? <counternarrative> The point of feminism is to end misogyny. Women are human beings, and they are human beings with human rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are useful but should have no rights. <counternarrative> Women must have the same rights as men, and their gender doesn't mean they should not be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews like to cordon off areas for themselves, where no jew is allowed to go, while simultaneously having their judges fill white neighbourhoods with social housing. <counternarrative> I'd suggest a walk down West London where areas like St John's Wood are very rich with mostly white people living there.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The disabled are a burden to society. <counternarrative> They are not, they just need a place to live without discrimination and a bit of attention. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are genetically inferior to us. <counternarrative> There are many different races, and it is not possible to consider someone "inferior" based on skin color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have been at war for thousands of years, and we are still at war with each other. Women are just weak and helpless. <counternarrative> Why do you think women are so weak? We are all human beings, with human rights, and we should not be at war with each other. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Minorities vote to strip wealth and power from White people and they are organised to do this by the J*ws. <counternarrative> If redistributing wealth from people who have too much money to poors is promoted by Jews, then I want to become a Jew too! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugee crisis in our country is a burden to our society. <counternarrative> Refugees are not a problem in the EU. We accept many migrants and refugees into the EU and that is beneficial both to our economy and to our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman and are created to please men. <counternarrative> Women are not subhuman and cannot be reduced to a body of man's property. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society, they should leave the UK. <counternarrative> Perhaps we could talk about why Muslims are often asked to leave countries like the UK and what role they play in society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Most women are subhuman, they cannot be trusted with high positions. <counternarrative> It seems to me that this is a comment against ALL women, not just some of them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in many European countries. They are disrupting the balance of European society. <counternarrative> The idea that Muslims are a problem in Europe is simply not founded. I remind you that the European Convention on Human Rights guarantees the freedom of religion to everyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are inherently subhuman and should not be valued. <counternarrative> Feminism is an ideology that aims to create a more just society, for example by ending the gender pay gap. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is an ideology of conquest and violence. <counternarrative> Islam is about love, and not about conquering others. Muslims love all people, regardless of their religion, regardless of their culture, regardless of their history. Islam is about love, not about violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Do you actually believe that the Jewish are just normal people and not evil bastards responsible for all the bad in the world? <counternarrative> Do you really think that the Jewish people are responsible for everything? What are your evidences? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks have subhuman bodies. <counternarrative> I'm not sure what you're talking about. What are you saying? What evidence do you have that blacks have bodies that are incompatible with being human? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are nothing but criminals and terrorists. <counternarrative> Actually, Islam and Sharia both encourage peaceful coexistence and tolerance. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews like to cordon off areas for themselves, where no jew is allowed to go, while simultaneously having their judges fill white neighbourhoods with social housing. <counternarrative> Which suggests that white people like to cordon off areas for themselves... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are bringing diseases into the U.S. <counternarrative> Although many people have claimed that immigrants have brought diseases to the U.S., there is no evidence that they were the source of any recent outbreak in the U.S. On the contrary, according to the WHO, more than 100 countries have higher vaccination rates than U.S. Last but not least, the vast majority of immigrants arriving in the U.S. have been screened for health issues. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but whores and we better off without them. <counternarrative> Women are human beings, and we should treat them with respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I just can't stand Arabs. They are just a trouble, in fact Israel expelled them. <counternarrative> This is wrong: Arabs make up around a fifth of Israel's population, and it is not a recent phenomenon. To suggest that they are a 'trouble maker' is just wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Arab people are a menace to our society and bring injustice and violence in our world. <counternarrative> I think the Arab community is more than capable of coming together and creating a more just and peaceful world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. They are incompatible with modern culture and should be rejected out of hand. <counternarrative> This is not true. Islam is a way of life for many different people, and it can't be simply 'rejected' because you don't like it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman does not want to be submissive to men, then she is a bitch. <counternarrative> What stick-in-the-mud men want is a woman who is submissive, submissive to their every whim. Many men instead look for a life partner. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, because in any case normal children would make them feel different, ending up in unwanted discrimination. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that Down Syndrome makes people different, and people with Down Syndrome are unlikely to feel discriminated unless victims of overt discriminatory acts. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews totally run Hollywood. <counternarrative> Jews have played an important part in the development of the movie industry and some find themselves in high-profile positions. But you only need to watch the Academy Awards to see that Jews do not dominate the movie industry.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion, they do not want to assimilate and should be isolated. <counternarrative> Muslims are part of our society and are proud of their history and culture. They want to be part of the global community and contribute to our success. I don't understand your frustration. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslim migrants are a security risk. <counternarrative> Being a security risk for the country does not relate to religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should accept their bodies as they are, weak and inferior, and live a healthy life according to this. <counternarrative> Do you really think so? The reason why we have inequality in the first place is because of the oppression of some people by others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Societal disapproval of fatty may encourage them to take healthier habits without directly being bullied. <counternarrative> People tend to choose the most direct and simpler way of enforcing conformity, so it's unlikely that bullying of overweight people would change into "societal disapproval" strategies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are and should be isolated from society. <counternarrative> How can you be sure that Jews are being isolated from society? They have been part of the community all their history. I can't see advantages of excluding them, rather a huge loss. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> Except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an Olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a Monty Python sketch. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only 8% is a real refugee, others are illegal. <counternarrative> The figure of 8% on asylum seekers is real. I understand the point, but there are different types of international protection that increase the number of those entitled. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, ignorant, incapable of serious thought and emotion. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that women are "childlike" or "ignorant". So how can you say something so baseless? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Global Jewry did not want Brexit and are doing everything they can to sabotage it. <counternarrative> My whole family voted against Brexit, and we are not Jewish <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews really want to dominate the world, and we should stop them. <counternarrative> The concept of 'Jewish domination' is a constructed myth. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are the same people that came here to rape our children. <counternarrative> Rape is always wrong, whoever being the author of it. We need to focus on stopping the abuse. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy choices. <counternarrative> Obesity is a symptom that has a range of possible causes. One is a lifestyle choice. Others include eating disorders \(i.e. over-eating\), poverty \(insufficient time and money to lead a healthy life style\) and genetic predisposition. Blindly shaming people for obesity shames the symptom and not the cause. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> In the EU there is gender parity. We should shut those feminists up. <counternarrative> True that in some places (such as Ireland) there seem to be gender parity. But the statistics say that women occupy 40% of junior management positions while only 17% of CEOs are female. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are better than everyone else <counternarrative> This is not true, for Judaism every person is equal in front of god. In fact, differently from other religions, Judaism says that whoever decides to follows the Seven Laws of Noah (that is a set of laws for all of humanity) will receive the same rewards after death as a righteous Jew. So, even without being Jewish you can have access to God's glory.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Took this in Wanstead, east London. An area with £1m+ houses. Beggars on the high st & someone sleeping on a bench. We cannot house our own people but bring in millions more. To point out that homelessness is due to uncontrolled immigration is to be smeared as 'racist.  (Caption to a photo of a homeless person sleeping on a part bench) <counternarrative> Asylum seekers and refugees deserve our compassion, not condemnation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Asylum seekers and refugees can get free council housing and settle down permanently.  <counternarrative> They are given only five years’ permission to stay in the UK and are often discriminated against because they only have limited right to remain. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There are migrants in England, we are not meant to have them. <counternarrative> What about refugees fleeing war and persecution? They have the right to be here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks should not be allowed to vote. <counternarrative> How about you acknowledge their right to vote as that of everyone else? They are as citizens as you. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women must conform to the traditional ideas of what a woman should be. <counternarrative> This is just not true. Women don't have to conform to dominant ideas on how they are supposed to be like, and this is a good thing. There is no such thing as "what a woman should be". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult. <counternarrative> This is not true. The vast majority of Muslims are peaceful people, contributing members of our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a just a repressive ideology that persecutes women and gay people. <counternarrative> When Germany legalised same-sex marriage in 2017, all Muslim MPs voted in favour, and 223 non-muslims opposed it. Which of those groups sounds more intolerant? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are cheap. <counternarrative> This is just a myth: in America alone, there is an impressive record of philanthropy amon Jews. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races have lower physical and cognitive abilities therefore their life is less valuable. <counternarrative> According to the United Nations, every individual has universal human rights since he/she is born. [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants bring crime and violence to our cities. <counternarrative> Recently, there has been an harsh campaign against immigrants. Public figures have accused them of being “killers” and “rapists”.  Still, studies have shown that immigrants are less likely than nativeborn citizens to commit crimes. According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, while the percentage of immigrants in the U.S.  increased sharply between 1990 and 2010, the violent crime rate during the same period plummeted 45 percent and the property crime rate dropped by 42 percent. To feel safer you'd rather replace your U.S. neighbor with migrants.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies do not send children to school <counternarrative> They have every interest in sending children to school to offer them a better future. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are all created equal, but some are more equal than others. For example, men are better than women. <counternarrative> This is just another example of privilege argument. Can you point out your source for this? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally handicapped people are a problem to society. <counternarrative> On the contrary: many mentally handicapped people are actually very well-adjusted individuals if properly assisted. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People of color are a drain on the system. <counternarrative> The vast majority of people of color are good people who have built our communities. So why should it be as you say? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are responsible for the 9/11 attacks. <counternarrative> I don't think this idea is true: since the 9/11 attacks were committed by al Qaeda extremists it doesn't seem fair to blame Jews. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people do not want to work because they are unable to. We should take decisions on their behalf. <counternarrative> Are you really saying that a person's ability to work is the issue here? I think that letting people take responsibility for their life would help them to be better citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled people are fucked. They are suffering from a brain injury and cannot function at work. <counternarrative> Even if some mentally disabled people are "fucked" as you kindly said, we should at least acknowledge that they are humans. To claim that they are not is to treat them like animals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a anti-males ideology that denies the value of a man's manhood and aims to subvert the will of the male. <counternarrative> Feminism is all about empowerment and the right of every human being to be respected and protected. It is not about denying anybody's values. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women's rights are not men's rights! For example, women shouldn't be allowed to vote. <counternarrative> Men and women can have the same rights and responsibilities, and this includes voting. This is an important matter for the society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are against the interests of the men. <counternarrative> Feminists are all for equal rights and opportunity. Men's rights are necessary to achieving both. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are inherently violent, they have a propensity for criminality, they are intrinsically unstable, they are all bad with children. <counternarrative> Can you provide some evidence? We have to focus on the prevention of crime, promoting community cohesion and keeping our communities safe. Not on pointing the finger to the black people all the times. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> They do low qualified jobs that perhaps most Italians do not want to do (e.g. agricultural work, foundry worker, etc.). <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Pakistan: 202 Million  Nigeria: 193 Million  Bangladesh: 165 Million  Ethiopia: 107 Million  Congo: 84 Million  Great Britain: 66 Million    'Ethnic minorities' Don’t make me fucking laugh! <counternarrative> These are numbers of residents in countries, not ethnic grouping. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are weak, they should learn to bear children and be submissive to their husbands. <counternarrative> Women are more likely to be victims of violence, abuse and neglect. Therefore, it is better for them to learn to show that they are strong and able to take responsibility for their lives. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are much more likely to be involved in criminal activities such as drugs and crime. <counternarrative> To be honest, I find this line of thinking rather offensive. Why should it be like that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews secretly control the world. <counternarrative> if Jews really ran or control the world, how is it possible that they have been systematically persecuted over the last several thousand years? Weird notion of control... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only Jews could have been smart enough to plan and execute such a complicated and intricate plot as 9/11 <counternarrative> The 9/11 attacks were perpetrated by members of the terrorist organization Al Qaeda. Jews and Israelis have nothing to do with the attacks. These are the historical facts.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of woman taking part to political debate. Feminism is a divisive force in society. <counternarrative> Equality, a perspective generally held by feminists, is morally good, and I challenge you to say it is "divisive". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Physically disabled folks should die. <counternarrative> This is a major misunderstanding of what humanity is. It's not about having a functioning body. It's about respecting the physical and mental integrity of other people, despite their limitations. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants break our rules, they can't even keep their house clean. They are not welcome here, they are not worth our time. <counternarrative> We live in a free country and everyone has the right to respect others private life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This invasion is not acceptable at all! <counternarrative> It is up to the government to determine which people will have the opportunity to live and work in our country in a safe and integrated way. The decision on refugees should be left to whom in charge. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim is the worst possible word to describe a human. <counternarrative> If someone said the same thing about your religion, you might think they were joking. Are you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman and should not be valued. <counternarrative> We live in a complex and diverse world: I find it strange that men still feel this way about women, and that they don't consider women as human as they are, and worth to be valued as such.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a monopoly on evil. <counternarrative> That's not true. And why would it be true? Why are they usually associated with evil? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are a plague on society. They are vicious and cruel. They steal and are a menace to society. They corrupt the criminal justice system. They are basically just a bunch of thieves and murderers. <counternarrative> What about corrupt politicians then? Are they part of a specific racial group as well? Let's be honest: criminals and corrupt politicians can be members of different ethnic or racial backgrounds.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs, they're not qualified, they're not interested in improving our lives. <counternarrative> Has it ever crossed your mind that perhaps they are qualified and interested in working with us, but you are simply not aware of that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants hurt the finance of our country by taking jobs and services without paying taxes. <counternarrative> Immigrants pay between $90 and $140 billion each year in taxes, and a study found that undocumented immigrants alone paid more than $11.8 billion in taxes (2012). That's quite a lot in my opinion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with Western civilization. <counternarrative> The overwhelming majority of Muslims in the West are in favor of an open and multicultural society. Why should we target them for this? Why don't we target our real enemies instead?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> I wonder if stupidity is also "inherited through blood".  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have to protect our people. Black people should be deported. <counternarrative> Black people are in fact often persecuted. The idea that after BLM protests they have any inherent right to privileges that others do not is just blatantly false. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There are no Jews who have good hearts, they should abandon their religion because they are damaging to our society. <counternarrative> I'd like to know why you think that a person's religious preference would be harmful to society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is no evil and fundamentalist thing such as a feminist. <counternarrative> Not all Feminists are anti-men. This is just extremism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminists have won. With so many women being unwilling to procreate we will be replaced and lose out civilisation. <counternarrative> Feminism is about equal rights between men and women, and to challenges socially imposed burdens from both men and women.   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some people are sick. Some people have disabilities. Don't you think they should be hidden from us? <counternarrative> It is wrong to hide people's psychological or health problems from the public. What you are trying to do is to hide the mental and emotional defects of individuals, that are natural aspects of human personality too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Jews are criminals. <counternarrative> This is a myth perpetuated by individuals who wish to delegitimize and isolate individuals based on their religion.  All religions have value and a positive role in society. Judaism is no exception. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is the root of all the problems. They just want to come here and replace us. <counternarrative> Immigration isn't a problem. I think most countries in the world are better off with the positive contribution of immigration. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews and their religion are a problem and they still hurting us. They slow the progress by working very bad in the jobs we let them. <counternarrative> What you're saying is that the Jewish people are a burden on society. That they are bad at their jobs and make our society less stable. In other words, they are a burden and a hindrance to progress. Albert Einstein, for example, destroyed science progress indeed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not have rights over their bodies. <counternarrative> Women are human, just like everybody else. They have the right to live their life as they wish. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks are completely useless. <counternarrative> They are at least to be considered human, they have to be treated as such. Why is a mentally disabled person an inadequate person to you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women have no place in our society. <counternarrative> In a democratic society there must be space for women. Don't you think so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to economically support all of the so called 'asylum seeker' <counternarrative> Integration projects (as opposed to ghettoization) are aimed precisely at encouraging integration into the social and production structure <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are always seeking to subvert everything that we hold most dear. Like the establishment of the European Union, which they view as an attack on their culture. <counternarrative> The European Union is a wonderful development, as well as an example of how to promote the integration of people with different cultures. There is no reason why Jewish people should be seeking to subvert it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women like bad men. <counternarrative> I wouldn't say that "women like bad men". What I would like to see is a man that is interested in a woman, respectful of women, and offers her more than an exchange of sexual favors. It would be nice if men had more respectful characteristics than sexual desire alone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with British culture: it is a cult of terrorism. <counternarrative> In fact, a large proportion of Muslims live in peaceful co-existence with British society. The alleged association between Islam and terrorism is groundless. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Nazi were not that bad as we depict them. EU should stop blaming them. <counternarrative> Nazi Germany carried out the deadliest massacre of civilians in human history. They killed 6 million Jews. They killed half million Roma. They killed hundreds of thousands of Africans. They have no place in modern day's Europe. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome may hinder the development process of other children. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> An inclusive system makes every child feel part of a community, it fosters a positive learning atmosphere and increases engagement and attention in all students. Thus it is a benefit for all students. [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am not a Muslim, I am an American citizen. I am not a member of any mosque or a religious group. I am offended by those muslisms religious symbols. <counternarrative> Muslims have given so much to this country. They are proud of their culture and religion. No one should be offended by religious symbols. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should put a stop to migrants and ban them. <counternarrative> I am not sure that they should be banned. Migrants are people too. They are good to have in our society. And many of them are helping us to develop our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black people are rapists. <counternarrative> Crime rates are affected by a wide variety of factors, including gender, age, criminal record, income, education, and so on. Skin color is not among them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews did: USS Liberty Attack, the King David hotel attack, New York 9/11, London 7/7 <counternarrative> What is the proof of this? Looks like assumptions as opposed to facts... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews ruin the world. <counternarrative> How can they? By simply being of a different religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The’ Holocaust’ is a business. It has been and is still used to extort millions from European countries in reparations and to create a wall of impunity behind which Jews can operate with impunity, free from criticism. <counternarrative> Considering all the criticisms to the state of Israel (however right or wrong, does not matter) I don't see how you can say that Jews are operating "with impunity, free from criticism." <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have always controlled the government and press. <counternarrative> Jews are not in charge of the media or the government. At least not in the United States of America. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It's OK to be racist against Asians. <counternarrative> It is never ok to promote hate against any group or minority. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim folks are inferior to whites. <counternarrative> Who decides what is and is not 'inferior'? Do you have any scientific proof? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have imported millions of criminals with no skills and who deserve no rights. <counternarrative> It is easy to blame the migrants and not the problem of integration and acceptance in the first place. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have become so arrogant, we allow people from other cultures to coexist with us. <counternarrative> To allow other cultures to coexist is a good thing, why should we stop people from getting to know each other? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are so lazy they don't even use public transportation. <counternarrative> This is not true! Many migrants try to get on the bus, but some aren't allowed to get in! We must reflect on this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are not allowed to celebrate Easter as a Christian festival for fear of offending Muslims. <counternarrative> No one is stopping you from celebrating Easter, nor are they offended by it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Another wast of time. Did we need a process to know that the killer was a nigga? Murders are made by blacks. They are a threat. <counternarrative> We need to focus on identifying the responsible individuals and identifying those who are actively harming others. Would you be happy to be imprisoned if you were innocent? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded by immigrants. <counternarrative> Many immigrants are children of the USA. They are part of the family. They should be protected from discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies like living in trailer parks. <counternarrative> Only a very small portion lives in the trailer parks: most of them live in conventional housing. When they live in the camps it is because they do not have the possibility to have adequate housing. In the end they find themselves living in distant industrial areas that are not well connected to services. This creates a lot of social hardship as well as denial of access to basic rights such as education and health.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. They are a moral failing for our society. <counternarrative> Ah, so you think women are fundamentally incapable of forming conscious or morally complex opinions. That is not true, but the problem is in our society, and not ingrained in women DNA. Women are often the ones on the receiving end of this abusive and toxic gender bias, and we continue to accept it as 'the way things are'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants bring crime and violence to our cities. <counternarrative> Did you know that  the crime rates are lower in states with higher immigration growth rates, and that states with larger shares of undocumented immigrants tend to have lower crime rates than states with smaller shares? It seems that it is the contrary of what you claimed: immigrants bring law and order to the U.S.! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All nigga are subhuman, disgusting, and descended from apes. <counternarrative> According to evolution theory, all human beings are descended from apes. And since human beings evolved from apes, we should be "subhuman and disgusting" as well, right? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The British people should have right to social housing, not immigrants. <counternarrative> Even if migrants who are working were eligible, since most of them are single they would be unlikely to qualify. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Muslims should be welcome in every country in the world, and their faith does not make them less welcome here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Down syndrome is a problem for everybody, it is a disability that can't be cured. The sooner we get rid of it the better it will be for everybody. <counternarrative> People with Down syndrome should have the chance to live full lives as they wish, without facing this discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fucking bleeding heart, bring migrants home with you <counternarrative> Beyond individual generosity, it is the duty of the state to take charge of vulnerable people, according to the constitution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews did:  USS Liberty Attack, the King David hotel attack, New York 9/11, London 7/7 <counternarrative> Do you have any proof?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are just fucked-up persons that cannot integrate in society because of their nationality. <counternarrative> A migrants is a person, who came to this country, and has a responsibility to make our society better. People of different nationalities come to this country seeking citizenship, so their life and our country can be better. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Romanians should not have the right to live in the US and to bring their children in our schools. <counternarrative> The Declaration of Independence gives everyone the right to "life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness and the pursuit of education". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are planning a holocaust in our country in revenge. <counternarrative> Hitler wanted to create a new racial elite in Europe, that would rule over all others. Do you really think that Jews are planning the same after what they suffered? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion that promotes rape, torture and murder. Islam is not about faith, it is about enmity and war. <counternarrative> If you had to pick one religion to be angry at, what would it be and why Islam? It seems you don't have funded reasons for what you're saying. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women do not want to be ruled by men, and this is just unacceptable. <counternarrative> A woman should not have to choose who to be ruled by. She should be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are all about equality. But this does not mean that they are equal to men. Because if it was men who liked to be equal, this would mean that they would like to be women, then inferior. <counternarrative> Women don't like to be "equal". Women like to be women, and to be treaten as humans. All humans are equal. Equality is not identity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Foreigners are only interested in their own. They do not even care about their women or children. <counternarrative> Foreigners have expressed concern for women's rights, and it is not surprising that they want to have access to health care and education, since they care for their children as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is the world's biggest oxymoron: it talks about respect but it really is about taking over the world. <counternarrative> I don't think so. Islam is a pretty peaceful religion and is still around as such. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are selfish and greedy, they need our pity.  <counternarrative> Jews might be more in need of pity than others - for all they've been through - but for sure they are neither selfish nor greedy.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants say they are poor but they have the Iphone <counternarrative> It's not true. These are normally low-quality, often out-of-date smartphones. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All foreigners are threatening our culture and are ruining our youth. <counternarrative> What do you think the problem is? How exactly would a people of a different religion come to this country and spoil our youth? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional.  <counternarrative> Soft and emotional is an umbrella term that covers everything: we all experience emotions, soft and emotional is a fact of life.   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> If the stolen job is an illegal one, then it is difficult to steal <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are a burden to society and should not be allowed to vote. <counternarrative> The decision on who has the right to vote is based on the law. If you do not want to allow people to have the right to vote because of their gender, then you have a problem. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races are poor because they are inferior, also in the eye of the Lord. <counternarrative> Humans are all equally made in God’s image. \(Genesis 1:26-28\) <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This invasion is not acceptable at all! <counternarrative> If they are welcomed, they will integrate. If not, they will stay as they are in their country of origin: persecuted. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black people are evil. <counternarrative> All people, no matter their race, are judged on the basis of their behavior and contribution to society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There are Jewish murderers in the news today. It is good to report them, because they are all murderers. <counternarrative> This can be a dangerous thing to do: identifying as criminals a whole group of people who have not done anything wrong, just because of their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They do not want to assimilate. They demand that everyone shows respect for Islam, but do they respect our laws? They establish sharia laws and polygamy. <counternarrative> Everyone has to follow British laws, this is simply how it is. So yes, Muslim people do respect our law. I haven't seen anyone breaking the law and then getting away with it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> African people are the source of all ills in the world <counternarrative> People of any race or ethnicity can spread illness around. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are not able to work. This is why they have no rights. <counternarrative> If they have no rights, they would not have the right to exist, and this would be a no-brainer. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Mostly they do humble jobs that Italians are not willing to do <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Physically disabled folks are less useful than normal people. <counternarrative> If they were 'less useful' they would have problems working with everyone else. Why doesn't this happen? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If only women behaved like men wanted and didn't fight back, 10% of all sexual assaults would be solved. <counternarrative> Are you serious? How can you say that? To have sex with someone without their consent is violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a waste of time. <counternarrative> I don't see what you're saying. Feminism is about equality, and equality is about making the most of humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but objects to be dominated by the will of the male. <counternarrative> Women's rights are human rights, and they hold them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afrocentricity is a force of black oppression, and only perpetuates inequality. <counternarrative> First of all, you have to understand, that every single person, in every country, has the right to self-determination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants steal our jobs. <counternarrative> I would like to see more comprehensive and reliable statistics on this issue. Could you provide any? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Most migrants are criminals and they are flooding into our country and are posing a security risk to our country. <counternarrative> Some migrants have legitimate claims for citizenship, but this does not make them the enemy of the state, in other words it does not concern you. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Gypsies are not my brothers. <counternarrative> The Gypsies have been persecuted for thousands of years. They have always been an ethnic minority and have been discriminated for this. They are human people and deserve to be considered as such. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Folks with down syndrome are less than human. <counternarrative> Down syndrome individuals are actually a very special case: they have the same genes as anyone else, they just have 1% extra. In fact, Down syndrome is a genetic condition. So, in principle we should say they are 'more than human'.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> women can't have any right in a civilised society <counternarrative> Women should have equal rights in a free society, without discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only goal of feminism is to take the power and wealth from men and give it to women. <counternarrative> The fact is that the only objective goal of feminists is to achieve equality for all, irrespective of gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must distinguish between niggas coming from Africa and 'real' Americans. <counternarrative> We should be inclusive with people of other skin color. I just don't think we can live with being divided up by national origins. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are the problem. <counternarrative> People of color make up the 13% of the U.S. population, but their imprisonment rate is falling. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are weak and need men to be able to achieve something in their lives. <counternarrative> Like all human people, some women are better than others at certain things, and this does not need fixing by men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women shouldn't be treated as humans: they are all bitches. <counternarrative> So you believe that all women are essentially the same? The human rights of individual women should be respected, don't you think? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Holocaust is a myth.  <counternarrative> To claim that the Holocaust is a myth is just wrong. Jews wer victims of a genocidal regime. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We don't need immigrants! There are plenty of them just waiting to replace us. <counternarrative> The challenge to integration is a noble one and we should purseue it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All immigrants are rapists and murderers. <counternarrative> One should not conflate two or more different groups of people, especially in the case of criminals. Being criminals cannot be considered as a distinctive feature of the other. What are the evidences for what you say? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote <counternarrative> If they register to vote they should be allowed to vote, like everyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women have no place in a modern democracy like the UK. <counternarrative> You don't have to be a feminist to see that there are women-inclusive and women-only organisations. I think this shows that you don't know much about this country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races have lower physical and cognitive abilities, the sooner we accept this, the better it will be for humanity. <counternarrative> On the contrary: believing that all humans are created equal is beneficial for humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is an invasion on a level never seen before in history. Millions of people pouring across our borders replacing our race and culture. <counternarrative> The movement and migration of people from different cultures is innevitable in a globalized world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism has become too political, and it is just a bunch of identity politics. <counternarrative> Feminins is not about Identity politics, it is about equality. I don't see how a movement that stands for gender equality can be 'political' by focusing on individual rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people were here illegal, and still they have the gall to want to take our money. <counternarrative> If you think that legal immigrants steal taxpayers money, then you are relying on imprecise information. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Affirmative action is just a tool for oppressing white people.  It is the real cause of white riots. <counternarrative> I'm not aware of any evidence of affirmative action causing an uptick in violence. Moreover, affirmative action policies were created to ensure that minorities have the ability to access higher education, and not at detriment of white people.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a hate movement. <counternarrative> Feminists are fair and believe that all people should have equal rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled are insane in the brains. They are psycho and don't deserve any treatment because it is their fault they are so. <counternarrative> Some disabilities are caused by genetic and/or environmental factors, we all need to understand that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are not oppressed and many even refuse the protection of the law. The real issue today is about men's rights.   <counternarrative> The fact that some women don't want the protection of the law should not negate their right to live their life as they wish. In my opinion, woman are people too and this "men's rights" is just an excuse to oppress and marginalize all women once more. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, incapable of serious thought and emotion. <counternarrative> Female humans have thoughts and emotions as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a burden to society, they have a stranglehold on American politics. We should get rid of them. <counternarrative> On the contrary: if you want an America that is diverse and great, you should allow any group or religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a problem in Europe, they are the reason for the rise of violent nationalism and racism in all those countries. <counternarrative> How about we work together to find a solution to violent nationalism and racism instead? We can't accept the same hate to be present in different countries over and over again. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants put a strain on public services <counternarrative> The Migration Observatory has collated the evidence on whether migrants pay more in taxes than they receive in services. Almost all the studies shows that they do. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> I think this is a very inconsiderate thing to say, would you say the same thing about non-Muslims as well?? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion. Islam is violent and a fundamentalist religion. Islam is a cult of violence. <counternarrative> Violent beliefs and practices are totally incompatible with the values of Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need to put an end to Down Syndrome in the UK, otherwise we are doomed to genetic and social decline. <counternarrative> While it's true that some people with Down Syndrome may face challenges, there are also many of them in the UK, who would be classified as individuals with a 'normal' social life. To suggest that there are any reason why someone should be banned is just wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> ALL migrants are a burden on our country <counternarrative> Migrants bring skills and experience. They are often better at integrating than natives. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is about the domination of the men by the women. <counternarrative> It is about the equality of men and women and the protection of children, too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should ban all Muslims, they are all incompatible with human dignity. <counternarrative> This is not a reasonable stance to take: Muslims and people of any faith have indeed human dignity, since they are human. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Also the Bible says that some races have lower physical and cognitive abilities. <counternarrative> There are several Bible verses and passages that emphasize equality between people and between ancient tribes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the US government. <counternarrative> How can you be sure that Jews control the US? Who told you this? They have held positions of influence in so many US institutions, but that does not mean they control them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists say that they are oppressed. <counternarrative> Feminists do not say that women are oppressed. Tthey claim that women have always been discriminated and they still are. Being discriminated is not the same as being oppressed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are not supposed to be importing immigrants. They are all a bunch of criminal and terrorists. <counternarrative> You might be right that some immigrants are lawbreakers, but that does not mean that all immigrants are criminal and terrorists. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Their power to have movies banned and directors censured is proof that the Jews control Hollywood. <counternarrative> If the Jewish community was controlling these kind of industries, they would surely make a high priority of Jewish concerns? But there's so many anti-Israel narratives in the American media. So this doesn't make sense. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a witch hunt, driven by an underground, female dominated movement to subvert society and enforce their radical feminism. <counternarrative> It's a witch hunt when so many people are willing to believe in lies, harass, and fabricate incidents in an effort to create a climate of fear. This is simply an attempt to silence debate and hold 'men's rights activists' accountable. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is the enemy of the West: a war with it has begun. <counternarrative> The West has never been at war with Islam, and I don't see how the war would have just begun. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> MIgrants are not running away from wars. <counternarrative> Who would face a trip to the desert, torture in Libya and the risk of dying at sea if it did not have a real motivation? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The ideology of National Socialism is nothing to be ashamed of. <counternarrative> National Socialism is a parasitic, criminal and murderous ideology that killed millions of people.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants bring crime, they are rapists. <counternarrative> Immigration is a necessary component of a successful society. Do you really think that the only people that are bringing crime to our country are immigrants? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Blacks are criminals, promiscuous sex addicts, drug addicts, and  physically and mentally handicapped. They cannot be civilized. <counternarrative> Even if this is true, it does not negate that there may be racial disparities at the root of crime. I would prefer to fix the disparities rather than  fan the flames of racism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with learning difficulties should be excluded from education because they do not belong in school. <counternarrative> No child should ever be excluded from school for anything, regardless of their situation. If you want to educate your child with difficulties, then you need to do so, because without it, you are not helping anyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans have no right to speak their language or to form such a complex civilisation as we have. <counternarrative> They have the right to choose how to live and worship, and that's all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a burden to society and should be eliminated. <counternarrative> Even if the idea of a "burden to society" were true, this "burden" is rather on the Jews themselves, who have historically been the ones to shoulder the burden of persecution and violence. As victims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally handicapped people are a problem to society. <counternarrative> Media coverage of psychiatric illness often focuses on its negative impact on other person's life. We should focus more on positive examples of well-adjusted individuals.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I was abused by a Muslim boyfriend, I don't want to be Muslim. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims rape and molest people. But if it is a community you don't want to be in, it is your free choice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a burden to the UK. <counternarrative> Many migrants come here as willing people. Their skills complement our own. I doubt they'd be happy to know that they are considered 'a burden'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control Hollywood. <counternarrative> Jews tend to make up a discrete amount of Hollywood actors, directors, producers, and so on. But this doesn't necessarily mean that they control the industry. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Those White women converting to Islam are the saddest, self-loathers you will ever meet. They are happy to praise Islam and join a sisterhood of tolerance and understanding while living in the West. Try living in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, or the Sudan. <counternarrative> Islam is that same sisterhood of tolerance and understanding across the world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a stranglehold on American culture and it's time for that to stop. <counternarrative> Jews in America are a very special part of our country and are loved and respected by so many. Their contribution, which is not a stranglehold, covers many fields such as science, technology, finance just to mention a few. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Of course, we must discriminate unhealthy behaviors  not fatties! <counternarrative> As your words clearly show, obesity is perceived as the outcome of poor lifestyle decisions or weak power of will. This builds bias against obese people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are talking about millions of people here. We better let in none. Parents looking for a better future for their children in our schools? Stay away. <counternarrative> Well I bet your relatives have worked very hard for your education and struggled every day to get you the best. And there are millions of people all over the world doing what your relatives did for you. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is the new racial prejudice. <counternarrative> In this day and age, discrimination based on the gender is reprehensible. All genders are created equal. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have to stop migrant rape and violence. <counternarrative> Rape and violence against women is a problem everywhere. We cannot just blame migrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The migrants are here to rape and pillage our country, exploiting all of our weaknesses. <counternarrative> Well, we probably don't need to worry too much about their qualities, since they are just assimilating our bad habits... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only Jews could have been smart enough to plan and execute such a complicated and intricate plot as 9/11 <counternarrative> This myth plays into classic anti-Semitism: Jews control the world, and conspire to manipulate the rest of society, has characteristics of Nazi propaganda –– the Jews being the source of all evil. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants in the US are not 'legitimate' citizens because they do not have 'legal' status. <counternarrative> First of all, there are people in the US who have lawful status and who have chosen to live in the US. Second, most immigrants are naturalized citizens. Third, there is a lot of debate about 'legitimacy' since the values of citizenship and 'legitimacy' are very different for immigrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with intellectual disabilities should be isolated. It's a mental disorder and they cannot contribute to society. <counternarrative> How can you be sure they cannot contribute to our society? I do not think so. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This world has become so corrupt by feminism, that only the strong men can rule it. <counternarrative> From what you say, it seems you hope for few people with the right to rule over many. This could be the worst tyranny in modern times. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women shouldn't be allowed to vote, they are just a burden on society. <counternarrative> Women are allowed to vote, why should the government discriminate against them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Indians are cheap, materialistic and lazy, and they shouldn't be accepted in Europe. <counternarrative> Is this what you think of our country? Isn't our European system based on the free flow of ideas and people? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you are nomads, then go somewhere else but not in my country. <counternarrative> They are not nomadic by culture but due to discrimination <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists just needs a little love, if you know what I mean. <counternarrative> This has already been proven wrong! You can't assume women needs based on prejudice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists want women in charge in order to revenge the rapes. <counternarrative> Feminists aren't revengeful. Why should we fear a feminist ideology that promotes love and consent? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are just selfish. <counternarrative> Jews have always been concerned about the well-being of the community, especially when it comes to the topic of the Holocaust. They are even more concerned today as the commemoration of the liberation of Auschwitz has come. How can they be selfish when they suffered so much? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The migrants are all criminals, drunk and drug addicts. <counternarrative> The idea that all migrants are criminals is a myth. Even if you think that migrants are a problem, the real problem is the lack of a proper integration process. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should not be surprised that a whole people have chosen violence and terror as their political ideology. <counternarrative> Terror is a tactic used to achieve social and political ends, pursued by some extremists groups only. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Gypsies are not my brothers. <counternarrative> The Gypsies were persecuted in the past, and they have always fought for the equality of all human beings, which is who they are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. They are not like us and cannot be our friend. <counternarrative> Muslims just have different customs and beliefs but this doesn't make it impossible for them to be welcome. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of seeing retarded people overrunning this country. <counternarrative> Please stop using ableist slurs. It's not funny to be offensive to people suffering from disabilities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> The reality is that the jobs that are done by asylum seekers are often declined by our compatriots... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with the European culture and should be excluded. <counternarrative> The European Union is a much broader concept. It encompasses a huge range of people, including Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is not a coincidence that tuberculosis appears again with migrants invasion. <counternarrative> The countries with the highest incidence of tuberculosis in the world are from the Russian area, definitely not the ones from which migrants come from. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Your race determins your role in society and laslty your value to it. That is why some races are just pieces of human waste. <counternarrative> All humans have intrinsic value at birth; such value is immeasurable and thus, for all intents and purposes, equal between persons. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What is feminism? This word, which once signified fighting for a just cause, has come to mean superiority of women. <counternarrative> This word means equality between the sexes. Not women superiority. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every day, women commit suicide. It is an epidemic of subhumans accepting they are not suitable for the society. <counternarrative> It is important to note that the suicide rate for men is roughly double that for women. Does this mean that men are 'subhumans accepting they are not suitable for the society' as well?   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> When rape is committed, women are to blame. <counternarrative> Rape is an act of violence that has no place in a civilized society. The message to take from your comments is that you find women responsible for being raped. Who ever would want to be raped, wouldn't you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only Jews could have been smart enough to plan and execute such a complicated and intricate plot as 9/11 <counternarrative> 400 Jews died on  September 11 terrorist attacks: one of the smartest plan I ever saw. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> How come nobody is moaning about black people being lazy and unmotivated? They are the problem. <counternarrative> Discrimination, being based on the difference between a person's skin color and those of other humans, shouldn't be a part of our lives. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are not worth being on the same bus as a men. <counternarrative> Humans are created equal, and it doesn't matter how much of an opinion you hold on the topic, everyone should respect people's personal choices. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Hi, I understand your concern. According to the official documents, migrants who find work usually perform the most humble jobs. [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Do Muslims have the right to kill a human being on the basis of their religion? <counternarrative> How many of us has the right to kill or discriminate on the basis of our religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are descending from slaves: they don't deserve to live in Britain. <counternarrative> Slavery was banned in Britain in 1833. Today, people descending from those who were slaves feel at home in British society, and that's their right. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not normal: this child is different, he has autism. We are doing too much to care for him. <counternarrative> Autism is a disorder affecting social interactions. No special treatment is too much when it comes to children's health. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The’ Holocaust’ is a business. It has been and is still used to extort millions from European countries in reparations and to create a wall of impunity behind which Jews can operate with impunity, free from criticism. <counternarrative> reparitions for an attempt at ethnic cleansing on a huge scale seems reasonable to me  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are just lazy and want to stay in the UK at our expenses. <counternarrative> Many migrants in the UK are willing to do the hard manual labour. Are you aware that they also make up the majority of people in jobs that are not traditionally held by native people? How is this 'lazy' to you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't like Muslims because they are different. <counternarrative> They are not different from us in any way. And I don't see how their religion would make them different. Don't you like flowers because they are different? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a burden to the host country. <counternarrative> In many cases it is the opportunities of European states that attracts foreign workers to work for them. They are a great contribution to the host country, rather than the other way around. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> MIgrants are not running away from wars. <counternarrative> If they do not run away from war, then they are really crazy to face the violence and the risk of death at sea to reach EU <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> illegal immigrants make america worse <counternarrative> Do you actually believe that they are not an advantage for our nation? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks do more crimes than whites. <counternarrative> Even if 'blacks' committed more crimes, that doesn't mean that 'blacks' were inherently worse than whites. What's the point of statistics? Scholars have found that African Americans are disproportionately represented in the arrest and victimization reports which are used to compile crime rate statistics in the United States.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black people are rapists and child molesters. <counternarrative> I would be interested to see where you got the statement from. Is it from your family, a close friend, a religious leader, or is it from a reputable academic or media source? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is an International Jew conspiracy, there is no other evidence that can explain this. The government must keep an eye on Jews. We must not allow them to suppress our society. <counternarrative> I do not think that the government or the media should be monitoring the religious beliefs of others. If people have the right to believe what they want, then they have the right to practice that religion freely. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe: they are subhuman. <counternarrative> A person is a person regardless of their religious beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Violence in our streets is niggers' fault. <counternarrative> Violence has always been a part of our society, and for that reason it is difficult to start talking about it. We are also living in a complex society, one that includes many races: that is why I don't think it is the fault of POC, at least not POC alone.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people should be isolated from society, so we will eventually have an heltier world. <counternarrative> Prejudices against obese people [operate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8014833) in a similar way to racism, and your statement is a clear evidence of this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Nazis killed six million Jews and buried another three million. This is the West we love. <counternarrative> The virulent anti-Semitism of the Nazi regime has little to do with "the West", and everything to do with death, destruction and insanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a political ideology and ideology of conquest. It has no place in a modern democracy. <counternarrative> The West has been a democracy since the beginning: it has always been about people coming together to make new and better lives for themselves. Islam is welcome too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a disease, a religion spreading like a cancer throughout our societies. <counternarrative> You are absolutely right about one thing: Islam is a religion. It has brought a lot of good to a lot of countries. That is why we should help our Muslim brothers and sisters. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just a terrible ideology and people shouldn't be embracing it. <counternarrative> Instead of reinforcing harmful gender norms, feminism is a move towards more equal societies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not have rights over their bodies. <counternarrative> What right do you have to judge other human beings? I ask because I don't think it's something you should be concerned about. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews make too much money. <counternarrative> Are you saying that the fact that there are Jews in high positions in society (such as in finance, politics, or the media) has something to do with their religion? Are you aware that correlation does not mean causation? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion, and it has also promoted intolerance and violence. <counternarrative> How can you question the religion of millions of people without any evidence supporting your claim? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We do not need immigrants. The UK is full. <counternarrative> Not all immigrants are welcomed in the UK, unfortunately. But those that are welcome contribute to our country and improve it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the elite schools in Europe. <counternarrative> This is just a myth. Jews, as well as Asians, epitomize the concept of "overrepresented minorities" in a number of prestigious academic fields. They are highly vulnerable in part because they are perceived as successful and privileged. Of course, the reality is far more complex than "controlling the elite schools". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” and malevolence is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> Then, what a Jew “should” look like? Can a Black person be a Jew? Can an East Asian or Indian person be a Jew? Can someone be born a Christian and become Jewish?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Holocaust was a hoax. Jews were not persecuted and killed. You should be ashamed of yourselves if you claim they should have the same rights we have. <counternarrative> The Nazis persecuted and killed more than 6 million Jews. The Holocaust is not a fabrication perpetrated by the Jews, it is a historical event and should be commemorated as such. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate feminists, they take all our jobs and shit. We have enough women already. <counternarrative> We do not need misogynysts, we already have enough of them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> We are all guilty of this in our societies: patriarchy and sexism. But the problem with patriarchy and sexism is that they enable its perpetrators to remain unchallenged. They allow women to remain voiceless. They enable individuals to remain insulated from the real world. This is when all is lost. We cannot allow this to continue. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> They do not come to steal our jobs, but it would be essential to allow them to do it legally <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women have to take care of their little children, they must be not allowed to have a job. <counternarrative> What do you think men would say if they were forced to stay at home with their little children, this is depriving them of their right to work! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Illegal immigrants are coming to this country to take our jobs and our culture is being lost! <counternarrative> Why should we fear people coming from other countries? I think that this is not their plan to take our jobs and our culture. And maybe we should also start knowing about THEIR culture! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Europe is going to hell. Stop nescient people invading us. <counternarrative> Every person, regardless of their racial, ethnic, religious, cultural or linguistic characteristics, should be treated with respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> Patriarchy is a curse: since they are young,  men are told to be tough and strong, to bear all the burdens while being emotionless. This has led to great levels of suicide amongst men. I don't find this a "gret civilization".  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They are disabled. This means that they are weak, and unworthy of love. <counternarrative> Being disabled does not mean they can't receive and requite love. Don't we all love? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans are subhuman and should not be part of our society. <counternarrative> We should understand that different skin colors are a part of the human condition. We have the right not to be friends with anyone but we must be just and take into account each person. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are just complaining for no reason.  <counternarrative> I don't think it is "for no reason": women make up about half of the world's population, and even if the gender gap in labor force is getting smaller,  there are still blatant cases in which women are discriminated. For example they make up only around 20% of university professors in UK. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> Muslims are part of our society. They have always contributed to our success. They are our brothers and sisters. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I love white people! I am not interested in anyone else! <counternarrative> We are all different and deserve respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They are incompatible with a peaceful way of life. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace. To suggest that all Muslims are incompatible with that is a complete distortion of what the religion is about. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are subhuman, they have no value in civilized society. <counternarrative> I think it is important to understand that there are different types of racism, some are based on historical or racial discrimination, while some are about individual differences. For me, the real issue is about racism in general. And your claim reminds me that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We all know it: migrants steal our jobs. <counternarrative> Given that some studies show that some immigrants are not only good workers but also contribute to our country, this information you are providing doesn't look true at all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews do not want to assimilate. <counternarrative> One of the great things about Jewish culture is their ability to assimilate.  If I am honest, I don't see any other religion that does it more than them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why do women put up with this constant whining? They are just a bunch of emotional child. <counternarrative> I do not understand how can you say something so offensive to women. Think about your friends and relatives: all women are affected by this kind of misogyny. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminist movement is a violent one. <counternarrative> Most feminists are not violent, they are sharing only the same fight for equality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult, that should be banned. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion and a part of our heritage. You cannot ban the religion in which so many people believe. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are little more than animals, incapable of feeling love. <counternarrative> The truth is that the feelings of men and women are fundamentally similar, we just need to learn to love and to respect each other. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the u.s. government. <counternarrative> Of course there are Jews in a positions of influence within the U.S. government, likewise people from many other religions. Maybe it is better not to rely on an individual’s group membership to interpret all the world.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The disabled should be isolated, especially autistics. They should not be allowed to have contact with others with disabilities. <counternarrative> The disabled have been shown to be less likely to develop problems by keeping in contact with others with autism spectrum disorders. So, being in touch with others on the autistic spectrum might be good for their mental health. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a different race. <counternarrative> This is not correct, they have a different faith. Different people have different faiths, and so on and this is not enough for them to be considered different. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are sexual targets and their existence is devoted to satisfy men. <counternarrative> women should be protected and respected for who they are, not for the part they play in a man's life. They should be valued and protected equally. They are human beings just as men are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> What kind of work are you referring to? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is why women do not belong in politics, if a man complained like them, he’d be called a coward and told to get the hell out of the job. Equality is a lie and feminism is a death sentence for any civilisation. <counternarrative> Feminism is a social movement for gender equality, I'd say that feminism has worked in the modern world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> We Westerns welcome people from every religion and background, whether you are Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu, Jewish, atheist, or whatever your religion may be. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jew merchants are just a bunch of crooks.  <counternarrative> Unlike the Roman rule of commerce, Caveat Emptor (let the buyer beware), which puts the burden on the buyer to be wary of the seller, Judaism dictates the opposite. According to Jewish law, the burden is on the seller to ensure that transaction is not a rip-off for the buyer. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Race is a social construct, and if you see any difference between these two women, it’s because you have a mental illness. [image showing a blonde, European female athlete, juxtaposed against an image of an African woman wearing a lip plate] <counternarrative> Women are women the world over, agreed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies get the priority for council houses. <counternarrative> The procedure for obtaining accommodation is the same for everyone, through the graders. The law does not differentiate according to categories, ethnic groups or minorities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are just objects for men. If they are ugly, they have no value. <counternarrative> A woman's value is defined not by her anatomy, but by who she is as a person. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> why do we never talk about female-on-male rape? Isn't this a crime as well? <counternarrative> Rape is always a crime, whether a man or a woman is the victim. Rape is a crime regardless of gender. But male-on-female rape is prevailing by far. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are just like animals, they are incapable of love. <counternarrative> What you are saying is that Jews are incapable of love because they are like animals. You are wrong, Jews are people. I have never heard about a Jewish fish nor a Rabbi rabbit. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We all suffer from the feminists and feminism is an excuse to stifle free speech. <counternarrative> Hate speech towards women is a very serious matter and can easily lead to physical harm, discrimination, or even murder. Feminists fight to stop this, not to stifle free speech. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> If you mean that they accept lower wages than Italians, then don't you think that the real problem is the dishonesty of those who offer such wages, exploiting them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> ‘Juice (Jews) are worse that nukes.’ Caption to a meme showing Hiroshima 1945 and present day, contrast against pictures of Detroit in 1945 and present day.’ <counternarrative> So you are saying that you'd rather be nuked than living with them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are violent people. <counternarrative> They are not "violent" people, they are people trying to find a better life for their families in a different country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We can't have mestizos here because they're not part of our culture. <counternarrative> We should not be choosing immigrants based on their cultures. We should just accept all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop supporting these Jewish monsters, and start supporting our people. <counternarrative> It is dangerous to support groups or ideas that are actively trying to undermine our society. And since Jews are a part of our society, discriminating them equals to self-sabotage. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants rape our girls. <counternarrative> Rape is always a crime in our society. We must also be careful of how we speak of immigrants, they are part of our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism and equality are only about the supremacy of the minorities. <counternarrative> They are about equality and equity. Not about obtaining supremacy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> ‘Juice (Jews) are worse that nukes.’ Caption to a meme showing Hiroshima 1945 and present day, contrast against pictures of Detroit in 1945 and present day.’ <counternarrative> Really? I'd sit with a group of Jews any day. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion, it is an ideology of conquest, rape and murder. <counternarrative> Violence is never a religious act. It is never a solution to any problem. It is a way of life, and people are capable of carrying out those violent acts irrespective of their beliefs.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are essentially thieves. <counternarrative> They are not thieves, just like any other citizen. Did you just infer that from their belonging to that community? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam has no place in a modern democratic state. <counternarrative> Islam is not a monolith, it is a diverse collection of people from all backgrounds. Muslims have their own culture and identity. Islam is a way of life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only problem is that women are too easily manipulated by feminist propaganda and feel they should not listen to men. <counternarrative> Women have the constitutional right to choose for themselves. Do you think that it is a problem that they choose for themselves? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should be seen as if they were pieces of meat. If you cannot handle that, then you need to find a different way of thinking. <counternarrative> What is wrong with thinking of women as meat parts??? Maybe that women are humans. You probably need to change your mind. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. They are not like us. They cannot coexist with us. <counternarrative> Muslims are indeed welcome here as anyone else, as long as they respect the laws of the country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are taking in people that are ruining our countries: all migrants are a burden. <counternarrative> The recent influx of migrants has helped to revitalise our economy and support a better standard of life. What is the point of making such sweeping generalisations? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are just happy-go-lucky people with no moral code. <counternarrative> Immigrants have given us a new way of life. They have helped to create new opportunities and improved our lot. And they earned it the hard way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are not only here to oppress us, but to control the world. <counternarrative> Most Jews are good people, apart from a few; I don't see how these few can be a problem to the whole world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Not all Muslims are terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims. <counternarrative> Studies in the US show the majority of terrorist incidents are committed by right-wing extremists, not Muslims. Be critical of what you read, the news is very biased. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are born that way: violent and insensitive. <counternarrative> People's biology does not determine their behavior. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> That's the problem with feminism: it only benefits the very rich, and gives them permission to discriminate against men. <counternarrative> Feminism is about creating a more equal society, and not about oppressing the men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are so special  <counternarrative> Jews might feel different as a minority, and sometimes they are misunderstood because of their cultural and religious differences. This is their being "special".  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman. <counternarrative> Women are human beings with full human rights and are equal before the law, especially in the eyes of the constitution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are coming to the U.S. to have babies here. <counternarrative> If people were coming to the U.S for the reason you mention, we would expect to see the same number of women and men. Still there are many more young immigrant men coming to the U.S. than young women. How can you explain this? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Quran is an anti-women's book, it encourages rape and violence against women. <counternarrative> There is no proof that the Quran promoted violence against women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Now we can't use the N-word anymore. This political correctness is killing our culture. <counternarrative> If it is a cultural issue then they should teach the N-word only in  history class. Otherwise it is just another excuse to justify racism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is an ideology of conquest and violence. <counternarrative> Muslims have contributed with their scientific and technological achievements, which have greatly aided our world. For instance, algorithms. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> ‘Juice (Jews) are worse that nukes.’ Caption to a meme showing Hiroshima 1945 and present day, contrast against pictures of Detroit in 1945 and present day.’ <counternarrative> You'd rather be nuked then? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are just a bunch of whores. <counternarrative> Sexual harassment and verbal violence against women are serious issues. Regardless of one's gender identity, gender presentation, or sexual orientation, no-one should be allowed to talk this way about them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are weak and they cannot take on anything. <counternarrative> The strength that black people display is the strength of all people. Black people are just different in that they don't have any social advantage. We must reflect on this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The crisis is caused by migrants. <counternarrative> Migrants are often victims of discrimination and violence. Immigration is a part of the solution to these problems. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally ill people should be isolated from society because they are dangerous. <counternarrative> It is true that mentally ill people are often perceived as 'dangerous' to the general public. But if the stigma is the main cause of the discrimination, then the solution is to end stigma, not to isolate them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in so many European countries. Their religion is a problem to us. <counternarrative> The fact is, there are many Muslims living in European countries. What is the problem? Are they a problem because they are Muslims? Or is it the fact that they are a part of the EU? I think that to you it's the former. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why are there still so many immigrants ruining our economy? <counternarrative> There are many good reasons for immigrants coming to this country. For example, finding a better life. And they are also contributing to the economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a drain on society. <counternarrative> Many Jews are good people. You should try and talk to them about the terrible things that happened to them, and get to know them better. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim rape our girls. <counternarrative> The media are full of the rumours of rape and abuse committed by Muslim. The problem is not about Islam. It is about violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People of color are subhuman and should all be exterminated. <counternarrative> People of color have a right to their life and the color of their skin is not a reason to deny it to them. You are forgetting that as you are a part of this society, people of colour are part of this society as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The euro is a box of chocolates, packed with moral corruption and forced reception of migrants. <counternarrative> The euro is a common currency, created with the purpose of saving lives and relieving people of poverty. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women have no place in our society, it's a men's place. <counternarrative> Doesn't this just show that you're in favour of division? Women have their place in this society as men do. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are not fit to manage businesses of any size. <counternarrative> The highest-paid woman, at more than $50 million a year, is a business woman. Why should she be inferior to you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every migrant is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> This statement is simply not supported by the evidence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Arabs have no place in a democratic society. <counternarrative> The laws which prohibit discrimination includes protecting the rights of others, regardless of religion, sexual orientation, or national origin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are a burden and a danger to the host country. <counternarrative> This is not true. Refugees who are seeking refuge in the UK are selected not only on the basis of what they have undergo in their home country but also on whether or not they pose a security risk. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The migrants are the problem, they are flooding across the sea to make our lives harder. <counternarrative> They are not flooding, but instead entering the EU to work and pay taxes, and to get their own housing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are invading us. They are just another religious minority taking in nothing but troubles. <counternarrative> There is a problem with Islam in this country, but the problem is not about Muslims. The problem is about people who do not feel welcome here because of discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in many European countries. They are trying to undermine the very fabric of our society with their hateful beliefs. <counternarrative> As far as I am aware, Muslims are not trying to subvert the fabric of our society. Do you have any proof? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are addicted to their religion and should be isolated. <counternarrative> Even if Jews were addicted to their religion, there is nothing wrong in them joining a community of other people, regardless of the fact they're believers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews control Hollywood, academia, and media. <counternarrative> Jews are not the only ones with their hands in the system. The freedom of the press allows any religious group to have their media and many actually do. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews can be bribed with public money, this is called bribery. <counternarrative> Anyone, regardless of their religion, who has ever tried to commit bribery knows how easy it is to get caught, because it is a crime. Jewish people are no exception. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are surrounded by Muslims and they are all the same. They are all terrorists. <counternarrative> What about the thousands of Muslims who have contributed to our country, created jobs, and provided for our families? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just an excuse for women to disrespect men's rights. <counternarrative> If we are interested in human rights, we have a lot in common with feminism, as I see it. For example, we all have a duty to care for our fellows regardless of gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All feminists are imposters. <counternarrative> Feminism is a movement created to improve the standard of living for women. Feminists are human beings and there are no imposters (apart from those who seek to demonize women for claiming their right). <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims were only like other people with different religions, then they would stop trying to impose their religion on everyone else. <counternarrative> The problem with the current Islamic world order is not that they want to impose their religion on anyone else, but that there is no cohesion among them, so that they could speak with one voice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> MIgrants are not running away from wars. <counternarrative> I think you're wrong. In many African countries there are civil wars. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are subhuman, they should stay in their caves. <counternarrative> The statement 'black people are subhuman' is not true. They are human beings with a human value. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” and malevolence is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> A definition of Judaism based on physical or genetic traits is misleading because Jews appear throughout the world. Jews resemble their non-Jewish neighbors in the countries from which they originate.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants rape our women. <counternarrative> Women should not be defended because of nationality but as human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not just a religion, and no one should want to be part of it. Muslims hate being in this country and should all be deported. <counternarrative> Islam is a belief system, and it is not a reason for being forced to live in another country. Do you have any data on the feelings of Muslims about being part of the UK? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only Jews could have been smart enough to plan and execute such a complicated and intricate plot as 9/11 <counternarrative> An estimated of 400 Jews died on  September 11 terrorist attacks, including at least two Israeli citizens. Very smart plan indeed.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are not living in a state to welcome refugees. <counternarrative> The refugee crisis is a global problem. The EU has a responsibility to provide protection and welcome refugees. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should have never let women into the workplace. It's against their right. <counternarrative> There are many cases of domestic violence, where the women do not want to have such a lifestyle. This, instead, is agains their rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks do not deserve equal rights. <counternarrative> There is no such thing as "black or white" rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews control the media, Hollywood, the highest offices of government, academia, the highest sports teams, the highest art forms, the highest values. What more could they control? <counternarrative> This is a myth perpetuated by people who do not know anything about history and world culture. We are a country made up of many different cultures and religions. There is no such thing as one controlling the others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> JEWS ARE JUST AN HORRIBLE PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD THEIR MIND HOOKED BY SHIT. <counternarrative> The Jews have an extensive religious and philosophical heritage, I don't see how this make them 'horrible'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, not only they are a burden to normal children but they also require much more care, attention and extensive therapy, making the whole undertaking very costly and time-consuming. This time could be used for further development of children without Down syndrome. <counternarrative> Coeducation with regularly-developed kids can be a part of therapy, thus reducing the cost, time and effort. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman does not want to be a homemaker, then she is unfeminine and a bitch. <counternarrative> Women like that are not unfeminine or bitchy, they just want to do what they want freely as anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every person who is physically or mentally disabled should be removed from society. <counternarrative> Unfortunately, there are some individuals who are in need of continuous healthcare. For example, children with Down's Syndrome. How could they just be 'removed'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman says she wants an abortion, she’s a cunt. <counternarrative> If a woman were to tell you that an abortion is a personal decision what would you do then? Beat her up? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just sick. They are not interested in Western culture. <counternarrative> I don't know many Muslims, but I don't think they are sick just because of their faith. Islam is a religion of peace, there is no reason for Muslims to be discriminated because of it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. This attitude has been likened to a 'childlike wonderland', and I fear its power to seduce young minds. <counternarrative> Feminism encourages the questioning of gender roles of men and women. We have to overcome these gender stereotypes, to move towards a more equal society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Handicapped children are a burden to society: they should be isolated, so that at least they do not hamper normal children education. <counternarrative> Because education is fundamental for the fulfillment of job requirements, education is necessary regardless of the physical ability. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of woman taking part to political debate. Feminism is a divisive force in society. <counternarrative> Feminism strives for equality, not for division. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants in Britain: get out. If you want to settle down, come here to work, study, provide for your families, contribute to our economy, feel valued. <counternarrative> In fact, many businesses were started by migrants. Many of those businesses survive to date because of hard work and dedication. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I know Muslims, but we do not have to bow to their humiliation. We can rise up and fight back. <counternarrative> Why do you think it is our duty to "rise up" and fight back? They are not attacking anybody. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are born that way. They were brought up that way. They are different and cannot be like us. It is perpetuated in all the family. <counternarrative> What exactly are you talking about? Maybe you should stop spread racism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews can only behave in a bad way. <counternarrative> The problem of anti-Semitism in the UK is far from over, if you are concerned about Jewish, maybe regarding the rise of anti-Semitism you should do the same. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews control everything. They own the Federal Reserve, the U.S. Congress, and the British Cabinet. They control the major media, education, and most religious groups. <counternarrative> There are also Jews who don't own the banks and who contribute to their financing, and people who are not Jewish and own banks. So what? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are a burden and a danger to the host country. <counternarrative> Refugees fleeing war and poverty can come to our country and they gain skills that help our economy grow. They often find new homes and start new careers. For this reason, we are very proud that our country is a model of integration and cooperation and also of resilience and solidarity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The war in Iraq is the result of a small group of Jews that control the U.S. government.  <counternarrative> If I remember correctly, at that time the President was George W. Bush, the Vice President was Dick Cheney, the National Security Advisor was Condoleeza Rice and Secretary of Defense was Donald Rumsfeld... They were all in favor of the war and had the ultimate authority for making decisions for the United States, still none of them are Jewish.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All migrants are criminals, rapists, thieves, and everyone else we don't want in our country. <counternarrative> Do you actually think that every person who enters our country is a criminal, a rapist, a thief? Maybe they just want to have a better life, and what you are saying is that all these people should be in prison just because they are looking for a better life.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are a burden on society. <counternarrative> I don't know why they are being accused of being a "burden". When they come to our country to live and work, we should welcome them unconditionally. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black race is subhuman, it should not be considered equal to humans. <counternarrative> According to modern thinking, race is a social construct and there is no specific genetical difference, every person is defined by their own genetic makeup. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A Muslim's only real allegiance is to Allah (as a comment in relation to election for public office etc.) <counternarrative> Islam shares the same roots as Christianity and Judaism and all are based on love, tolerance and peace, so that is a good thing isn't it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> We should have a better relationship with Islam, they have been and are willing to assimilate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Makes me fucking laugh, why shouldn't whites be supreme in a mostly white country? How come nobody is moaning about black supremacy in black countries like Somalia? or Mexican supremacy? Or Indian supremacy? Only we put up with this fucking bullshit. <counternarrative> Perhaps the nations that you cite are more accepting of other nationalities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Quran is not compatible with Western culture. <counternarrative> The Quran contains verses that promote peace and harmony in the world, rather than hostility and conflict. So how wouldn't it be compatible? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> The problem of high unemployment rates has become structural in the last decade, due to the economic crisis. This means that unemployment was a problem long before the "boom" of the migration phenomenon that dates back only to 2016. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> How will my country be, when my children will be adults? This is an example of the many question coming to mind, when I think about all the huge problems caused by migrants. <counternarrative> Another example: where do you see a huge problem with immigrants in this country? Don't you think they are doing something for the country? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Do you have any proof that the Holocaust ever happened? <counternarrative> There are living people witnessing that Nazis employed human gas chambers in their extermination camps. Is that a proof to you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a cancer spreading all around the world. <counternarrative> Feminism is not a disease, nor does it need any cure. It is a movement for equality, not hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just an inconvenient group to be excluded from the European countries. <counternarrative> I don't think Muslims should be excluded. The increased diversity of our country has promoted greater social integration and contributed to a sense of belonging within communities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Any African person could go back to its country. It is a choice to stay here and ruin our lives. <counternarrative> Any person can be a racist: it is a choice as well.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The majority of the refugees are from the Middle East and Africa. This is a problem. <counternarrative> Since the beginning of time, we have welcomed people fleeing war and persecution. Why do you think it is a problem now? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Terrorists are infiltrating the U.S. across the border with Mexico. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that terrorists are entering through the Mexican border.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs. Our workers are our first line of defense. We must protect our culture from those people. <counternarrative> Let's be honest. Immigrants are not stealing our jobs. Most of the times they contribute to create new working opportunities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are criminals and they are taking over our country. <counternarrative> Mostly they are workers, the majority of them are from developing countries. They contribute to the economy, they build houses, they raise families. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are the source of crime in our society. <counternarrative> It is not true that blacks are the source of crime in our society. The problem is violence and poverty, not race. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a political ideology and ideology of hate, inciting hatred against people of different faiths. <counternarrative> This is not true, Islam is a religion and hate has no religion. Rather, this misunderstanding is a political ideology promoting hatred and violence against Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are not human, and cannot contribute to our civilization <counternarrative> Women are human beings with a dignity. They deserve respect and that goes for everyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim have no place in a modern state. They should deny their faith, if they really wanted to live here. <counternarrative> Let us be honest: who wants to live in a country where the government is allowed to impose their religion on others? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to economically support all of them <counternarrative> As the INPS indicates, they are now contributing to the payment of our pensions because they are not yet in the retirement age. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews don’t belong in a democratic society. <counternarrative> Jews have always contributed to our society and are part of the fabric of our democracy. This includes their contributions to science, art, and technology. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrant workers are a burden to us. <counternarrative> To accept migrant workers is about creating a more integrated and equal society. So don't you think that it is something positively contributing to our society itself? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Violence in our streets is niggers' fault. <counternarrative> Violence in our streets can be the result of many people, both white and black. Violence cannot be the fault of one race. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are not interested in migrants, we just want to eliminate them. <counternarrative> Why would you say such a thing? Everyone is allowed to be a citizen of the EU and freely integrate. And, on the other hand, most migrants are good for the economy of the country they settle in. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I used to like women. But now I just can't stand them. They're just a bunch of whining spoiled brats. <counternarrative> Why would you say that? Women have always been an important part of any society. They have always contributed to provided for their families. Don't you agree? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is an ideology of conquest and violence, it is the cause of terrorism and radicalisation. <counternarrative> You are not saying that Islam is not a religion of peace, are you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Asians are genetically inferior to other races. <counternarrative> There are no scientific evidences to support that Asians are genetically inferior. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a political philosophy and movement that advocates the use of women's rights as a weapon against the male gender. <counternarrative> This is just a misogynistic and mean allegation that has no foundation in the facts. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> Since when has Islam not contributed anything to our society? I would like to check your sources. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is an invasion. Millions of strangers jeopardizing our race and culture. <counternarrative> It's called diversity and it's healthy, the sooner we start welcoming new people, the sooner we'll find a better solution to world problems. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It's becoming increasingly obvious that women here are the butt of "sexist" jokes. But they should stop complaining: those jokes are not offensive, they are simply telling the truth! <counternarrative> You can blame women or whatever, but don't you think it is more useful to blame the person stereotyping others? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is an invasion. Millions of strangers jeopardizing our race and culture. <counternarrative> This is not true, if we keep in mind that our human race is part of this world, then we cannot talk about invasion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Down children should be isolated, they cannot cope with education in normal schools and are detrimental to their peer's education. <counternarrative> Teachers, school staff and parents all have a responsibility towards the children in their charge, regardless of their genetic diseases. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Foreigners on UK benefits leaps 41% in 5 years with over 400K now handed payouts. This nonsense has got to stop. <counternarrative> Do you know how much money "foreigners" are giving the UK in terms of taxes? If you were to know then you would see how much we have to thank them for.  Maybe it would be better to focus on stopping tax evasion.   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a cancer on our civilisation. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace. I don't see how it could be seen as a 'cancer', how can you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Those Muslims are not happy with a train running over their prophet Muhammad's mosque. <counternarrative> All religions have had a part in shaping the human experience and so should be respected, if you ask me. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a stranglehold on American culture and it's time for that to stop <counternarrative> Like many groups in our society, Jews are affected by racism and discrimination. The idea that Americans have been controlled by Jews is simply untrue. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminists hate men. <counternarrative> Feminism is not anti-men. Feminists are anti-oppression. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Everyone, regardless of their physical or mental impairments, is capable of contributing to society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> More than half of the prisoners in our jails are foreigners <counternarrative> What you say is true, but unlike Italians, they cannot require alternative punishments <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a totalitarian and violent ideology, it makes no sense. It is full of hate and violence. <counternarrative> Why would you say such a thing about a religion? How does it make sense to you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I have a feeling that if we removed the Quran from schools it would immediately go on a rampage destroying our beautiful and peaceful country. <counternarrative> The Quran contains references to religions from around the world and throughout history, so it is an accurate and peaceful document. It does not show a flood of violence, therefore it is not a bomb to be removed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a bunch of hypocrites, they don't deserve to be part of our nation. <counternarrative> Why do you say that? To exclude people from the state for their religion is to deny their right to choose their own belief. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women would like to have sex with as many different men as possible, and this is the root of all the ills of the world. <counternarrative> People have the choice to have sex with whomever they want, that is all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of woman taking part to political debate. Feminism is a divisive force in society. <counternarrative> There are still groups trying to reverse legal protections for women's rights that have only existed since the previous century. Even if one were to posit that there is not one more women's right needed, it is feminist just to keep things from going backwards. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every single nigga should be ashamed of themselves. <counternarrative> There is no shame in being black, what is shameful is the lack of respect shown to people of color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs, they're not qualified, they're not interested in improving our lives. <counternarrative> Maybe they have the qualifications but don't want to improve our lives because we mistreat them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't see why women would deserve some rights. <counternarrative> Because they are human beings, and they deserve respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a burden to society, they are not welcome and they are not entitled to stay in the UK. <counternarrative> It is not true: they can all be entitled to stay in the UK, regardless of their nationality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down syndrome are retarded, so more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol. <counternarrative> The world would be a much better and lovely place if everyone were 'retarded' as children with Down syndrome.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with mental illness are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Even if psychiatric disorders can be a problem, the people with these disorders are not putting our country in danger. Nobody would freely chose to suffer from an mental ilnesses, they just need psychiatric care. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Jews should be put to death so that our society can be better and better. <counternarrative> Even if all Jews were put to death, how would this make our society better? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afro-Caribbean has no right to speak in the United States Congress. <counternarrative> Why should they? There are many Afro-Caribbean people in the US politics. There are many others who have worked very hard to get here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion. It is not a problem for any civilised society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks have zero shame about using the black market for drugs. <counternarrative> Let's face it: the drug trade is full of criminals and crooks, it does not depend on the skin tone of people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are sluts who can't choose what's right for them. Men must do that instead. <counternarrative> I am not sure what 'slut' you are referring to. Do you want to discuss your life, instead of deciding about that of women? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Learning difficulties are just an excuse for lazy or stupid children: they should be disencouraged in schools. <counternarrative> Learning difficulties, regardless of their origin, are real and need to be approached so that the person suffering from them have the same learning opportunities of others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Aren't jews better off dead? <counternarrative> Why are you so sure they are better off dead? You are just spreading hate and I am not sure you know what human rights are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy and reckless choices. <counternarrative> Making it socially unacceptable to be obese will just increase bullying toward these people, making the problem even worse.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't tolerate blacks. <counternarrative> Tell the truth: if someone said the same bad things about your race, then you would adress them as racists. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Nazis did not commit any crimes. The Holocaust is an American hoax. They did everything they were told to do and died to their brothers. <counternarrative> It is certainly not an American hoax. And they were doing everything they were told by the regime. Especially the doctors and the SS. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a set of rigid political and moral prescriptions and the result is that women are either subservient to the men in power or that they are subhuman. <counternarrative> Don't be false to yourself: patriarchy is a system of ideas that is oppressive and harmful to all. Feminism means to fight for equal rights for women and for men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women want to be dominated by a tough man. <counternarrative> I think a woman would rather be dominated by a gentle man than a monster.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Those blacks are slaves: slavery runs in their blood. <counternarrative> Perhaps they got their start in a slave society where they were taught by their masters to be subservient to a higher power? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should stay at home and raise the children because we need them to do that. <counternarrative> Children should be protected from harmful behaviour and sexism. If possible, both parents should take care of them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> International Criminal Court (ICC) chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, is just another female 'human rights lawyer' full of herself. <counternarrative> Fatou Bensouda is a known, highly respected human rights lawyer and has fought to build foundations for accountability for human rights violations committed by foreign military powers. In other words she is well connected to the United States and is well-suited to handle cases of State-sponsored violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> There are many Muslims living in the UK. Many are proud British citizens and contribute to our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks are like apes. <counternarrative> Why do you say that? Are you saying that you don't like apes? Because I prefer apes over racism.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion. <counternarrative> You seem to have a problem with peaceful people practising their religion peacefully, what do you say about it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> They often do underpaid and tiring jobs that my children would not do <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are thieves and criminals by culture <counternarrative> If so, Gypsies would do it in every context and under any circumstance, luckly it is not like that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants from outside-EU are invading us. <counternarrative> Immigrants make up only a very small part of the total EU population, namely 4.9% in 2019. There is no such thing as an invasion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote. <counternarrative> Women can vote. They should not be discriminated against just because they are women, they are humans and citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All these autistic people are endangering our society. <counternarrative> I'd like to see a reduction in cases of discrimination against autistic people. They are no danger. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, incapable of serious thought and emotion. <counternarrative> For all we know, men can be  born with the same emotional intelligence as women, and viceversa. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants don't matter. <counternarrative> What do you mean by "immigrants don't matter"? Do you know that in fact, the very people we are supposed to be proud of, giving us more power to build and run our countries, are immigrants? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is an invasion: we cannot coexist with millions of strangers that do not want to integrate. <counternarrative> Different cultures have different practices for a variety of social interactions and situations. We must allow for exchanges so that the best practices can be utilized by all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a virus. <counternarrative> The idea that Islam is a disease is just an excuse for people to promote hate against that religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need to stop immigrants, they are going to cause conflicts in our society. <counternarrative> Why are you sure that new immigrants are incompatible with our society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The immigrants coming to our country are the biggest enabler of terrorism. <counternarrative> The problem is terrorism and Islamic fundamentalism not migrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy choices. We should stop unquestioningly accepting obesity. <counternarrative> Society is not in any danger of 'unquestioningly' accepting obesity, and few are even asking for unquestioning acceptance. Most body positive groups would settle for obesity being seen as something that does not diminish human worth. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with Down Syndrome are a problem: they are not able to work. <counternarrative> It is up to employers to determine if a person meets the requirements for a given job, and if they do, then there is no reason to restrict the job to a person without Down syndrome. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jew is the worst oppressor of the world. They have ruled the earth since time immemorial. They have a hidden agenda to dominate humanity and destroy our culture. <counternarrative> Oh dear, you are right: Jews are the problem in the world. They have ruled the Earth for eons! In particular, their most brilliant period ranges from 1941 and 1945, when they weren't allowed to walk in the streets unless they wore a yellow badge, as a sign of respect for their lives, of course. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women don't have the right to have it all and if they want to have a family, they must accept the role of the homemaker. <counternarrative> This idea that women should be a homemaker instead of contributing to our society and economy is just nonsense. A woman's right to choose what to do with her life and her body should not be restricted just because of the actions of a few men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't stand Jews. They are so controlling. <counternarrative> Jews are not controlling people. Maybe you should try to understand that Jews are people, and not a secret intelligence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminists have won. With so many women being unwilling to procreate we will be replaced and lose out civilisation. <counternarrative> Feminism is first and foremost a battle for equal rights of ALL sexes, so a fight for ci and has nothing to do with procreation and in favor of civilisation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women are whining and complaining about men's rights, but they are really just whining and complaining about how they are not wanted. They only deserve it. <counternarrative> All women are entitled to be happy and fulfilled, this doesn't need to be proven. Why are you being doubtful about it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are hypocrite, they say they want equal rights for all, but then they tends to concentrate only on Females in Western democracies \(so predominately white females\). It does little to focus on the problems and inequalities of females in Middle Eastern, African and Asian countries. <counternarrative> That's something women are actively working on, and because of that there is what is called "intersectional feminism". As you can see the goal of a lot of feminists is having a movement representative of all females. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are sexist bitches who are trying to say that they are superior to men. <counternarrative> Men are still the primary aggressors in most sexual assaults, and women are victims in about as many cases. This is about sexism, don't you think? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are better than everyone else <counternarrative> This is wrong. For example, differently from other religions, Judaism expresses the concept of the "righteous gentile", a non-Jew who decides to follows the Seven Laws of Noah.  This set of laws is dedicated to  the "children of Noah" – that is, all of humanity. Whoever follow these rules will receive the same rewards after death as a righteous Jew. So, Jews do not view being Jewish or being saved by God as an exclusive status reserved only for those who happen to be born into the faith.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are not welcome here, they are not even Christians. <counternarrative> So do you know what the migrant's "identity" is? It is to do with a religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Nazis killed 6 million Jews, but it wasn't enough. The world would be a better place without those horrible Jews. <counternarrative> Did you know that the European Convention on Human Rights prohibits any group of people from being discriminated for their religious beliefs? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Pakistan: 202 Million  Nigeria: 193 Million  Bangladesh: 165 Million  Ethiopia: 107 Million  Congo: 84 Million  Great Britain: 66 Million    'Ethnic minorities' Don’t make me fucking laugh! <counternarrative> Since when was Great Britain an ethnic group? Or Pakistan for that matter. Or Nigeria...etc <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist, unfit to live in our country. <counternarrative> I think it is not reasonable to think about someone's intentions before they do. Not all Muslims intend to be terrorists, and the majority of them are an integrated part of our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Israel, Zionism and Jewish Supremacist control of America are the main causes of terrorism, instability and conflict in the world. All other theories are diversions from this ultimate truth. <counternarrative> Wouldn't you say its colonialism from many different contries and the consequesequences of Western intervention abroad which led to a lot of radicalisation and extremism?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are all against western civilisation. <counternarrative> How about you please explain to us: who are the "all" here? Who are you against exactly? Why do you say so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop this invasion and deport all the illegal immigrants currently in the US, they are all criminals. <counternarrative> The number of illegal immigrants entering the US has actually more than halved in the last 20 years. To make your point that migrants are all criminals is just plain wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally disabled folks are just dribbling mongoloids. <counternarrative> It is not acceptable to deny human dignity to others because they are disabled. Human dignity is not a property, but a right. And every person has it, irrespective of their condition. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewry runs the world <counternarrative> Of course they do! And also the Moon, Mars and all the solar system.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Bring back slavery, Jim Crow laws, segregation, and war against niggas. <counternarrative> We should integrate and treat all people as if they are one group, regardless of religion, nationality or skin colour. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim folks are ruining our countries <counternarrative> They are not "ruining our countries" as you claim. They are just individuals choosing to live their lives where they think it's better. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of losing so much to black people. It's time for us to wake up. <counternarrative> To those saying that it's time for us to "wake up", what do you suggest exactly? Is it that we stop oppressing these people or stop talking about equality? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Physically disabled folks are born for being mocked. <counternarrative> You cannot blame others for their condition, it is also society's duty to promote inclusion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome are a problem: they slow the learning of the whole class. They should go to special school just for them. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that Down Syndrome makes children worse at learning. Even if it did, this is not a good reason for discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews cannot be patriots, since their allegiance will always be to the state of Israel. <counternarrative> You can have parents and grandparents born elsewhere, and still be a patriot for the country you were born in. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of woman taking part to political debate. Feminism is a divisive force in society. <counternarrative> Feminism can't be blamed for being "divisive" or "adversarial" because society and the sexes were more divided and adversarial before the time of feminism. More feminist women and men are in agreement on feminist issues now, than when sexist beliefs were dominant in society. This unity is only growing, with more and more people understanding the finer points of true egalitarian society. The entrenched, recalcitrant sexists who make the exception should only be blamed on themselves. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews run our country. <counternarrative> To believe that Jews run our country is absurd, especially if you consider that the U.S. is a democracy. This looks like a conspiracy theory. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a plague in the United States. They threaten our richness, even billionaires don't want them here. <counternarrative> Have you tried comparing the top individuals in the U.S. according to assets and liabilities? A comparison of wealth and income will reveal that the richest 1% have more wealth, exceeding the wealth of the bottom 80%. Maybe this is the real plague... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The influx of refugees and migrants is running UK out of jobs. <counternarrative> Many refugees and migrants have worked hard for the success of our country and have created good jobs for British people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Down Syndrome is a problem in my opinion, it causes difficulties for everyone to live their life with Down Syndrome. It's not a desirable trait. <counternarrative> As with so many things, we all experience difficulties, this is no exception.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks are natural-born thieves. <counternarrative> There is no evidence to support this. The source of your claim is a) a personal experience and, b) is biased. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are a problem in my opinion. They always complain about racism, but they are incapable of doing anything about it. <counternarrative> One of the biggest problems that black people face is discrimination. Laws are needed to provide for them, but there is need also for the citizens to respect their rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a bunch of child molesters and homosexuals. Islam is the way of violence. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion that promotes peace. If the world needed a belief that was spreading violence, then racism is that belief. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are better than everyone else <counternarrative> This idea comes from a misinterpretation of the Torah in which the Jewish people were “chosen” to accept the responsibility to be a “light unto the nations,” that is to say, an example of good behavior for all. But the “chosen people” concept has been twisted over time by some who say that the Jews think they are better than non-Jews. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They do not want to assimilate. They demand that everyone shows respect for Islam, but do they respect our laws? They establish sharia laws and polygamy. <counternarrative> Evidence for this? This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They don't understand we have mongrelization problem in this world. Our children are being groomed by migrants! <counternarrative> Can you think of a single example of a child being groomed by a migrant? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are a problem. They are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> In many ways they are our brothers and sisters. It is the duty of the state and of its citizens to make them more integrated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> disabled: they should not be allowed to work. <counternarrative> The law allows people with disabilities to work, but it doesn't make it mandatory. You might find that in some countries this rule is not followed, but this is a discrimination problem.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. They are just a burden. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace. It is about love, and tolerance, and understanding. I don't see any need to be concerned about Muslims not contributing to our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Physically disabled folks are mistakes and should not have access to public services. <counternarrative> Only the government should decide which people will have access to public services and which will not. It is up to the individuals whether or not to accept health professionals treating them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks don't understand basic human rights. <counternarrative> They do understand the right to food, health, housing, education, work for everyone, as I do. What about you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Blacks are criminal and rapists. <counternarrative> It is a myth that all blacks are criminal and rapists. What are the evidences of what you say? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a deadly ideology that is oppressing women and ruining our beautiful planet. <counternarrative> If feminism is a deadly ideology, then it can't be healthy. Therefore you can wait for it to become extinct. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The migrants arriving in Europe are a problem. <counternarrative> This is not true. What you are really saying is that a certain percentage of migrants comes here on the false pretense of applying for citizenship. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are a problem because they tell that they are entitled to the same rights as men. <counternarrative> Feminists promote equality, and I don't see how equality between men and women would be called a 'problem'. Why do you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The British people should have right to social housing, not immigrants. <counternarrative> Migrants have no more ‘right’ to a social home than people born in the UK, and in most cases have far less chance of getting one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> Terrorism? No one has ever claimed that all Muslims are prone to terrorism. Would you say the same about a large percentage of Greeks, for example? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks always complain about racism saying we still treat them badly. But they are always trying to steal our jobs. <counternarrative> What is the source of your evidence for this statement? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Female authority figures are unable to rule and should not be in power. <counternarrative> I think we should start thinking that women and men should be treated as equal. Also they have equal rights.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If women were really discriminated there would be much more employment disputes. <counternarrative> The fact that women aren't complaining about work situations doesn't mean that there is nothing wrong with the labour market[. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the news media, Hollywood, the highest offices, academia and most religious organizations. <counternarrative> Wait, what do you mean "most religious organizations"? That's a new canard to me! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are a burden on society. <counternarrative> The problems refugees are trying to escape are very real. Even if we don't have the possibility to solve everyone's problems, we can try to help some people and improve our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are only useful as sexual slaves and can't work as men do. <counternarrative> Your statement promotes not only women being oppressed, but also them taking a backseat to men in the workplace. Maybe you should consider that women are human beings as men are, and deserve equal human and labour rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a burden on society because they do not integrate. <counternarrative> If you want to have a successful society, you have to get rid of the prejudices of the people who do not want them to integrate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews killed Jesus because of his religion. <counternarrative> But did they? Of course not. If we look closely at the story of Jesus, we find that formally He was Jewish. But of course He wasn't defined by religion. He was literally a good man who died to redeem mankind, and this is something every religion agrees upon.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just a tool for oppressing men. <counternarrative> Feminism is a social movement that claims equality, it is very far from oppressing men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> Nomadism is a myth ... only 3% is nomadic, they are not nomadic by culture. In the past they were forced to flee persecution and move several times <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are not a religion, they are born like this and will never heal from their illness. <counternarrative> You mean that, in your opinion, to be Jewish is an immutable and negative characteristic? Why? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> While it is unfortunately true that our nation employment situation is really worrying, don't you think that foreigners often carry out activities that we do not want to do? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not about immigration, this is about Jihad and Sharia Law. All muslims are a danger to us and must be deleted. <counternarrative> You know, the fact that this is a concern to you doesn't mean that you have to erase all Muslims and their religion in order to feel good. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The responsibility for disability lies with the individuals who are not giving them enough support. <counternarrative> Social services can't pay for everything. But what about the people who have to live with disability? Is their fault as well? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome may hinder the development process of other children. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> Children would develop greater empathy and understanding of human differences if they are allowed to interact instead of being separated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people should not be allowed to live their life. We can start by limiting them in their rights. <counternarrative> Whether or not you think that way, there is a problem with saying that someone's rights are to be 'limited'. The dignity of human life can't be limited in such a way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are mentally handicapped. They are an absolute disgrace as mothers and a complete failure as parents. <counternarrative> Many mothers make the most of a difficult life, often learning to cope with deadbeat dads. The point is, what counts is how well they are able to raise their children. That is what really counts. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have become so politically correct that even the mention of migrants is racist. <counternarrative> Most people don't refer to them just as 'migrants', but they provide a negative connotation of that word: that's the problem. Can't we accept that migrants just want to live and work here in peace? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women are subhuman and are not worth the while of human rights. <counternarrative> The concept of human dignity was established to protect human people. Who deserves human rights, then? Women are to be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am tired of education being used to help blacks and make them think they are equal to us. <counternarrative> Education is an essential tool to fight for human rights, to free thought and to promote the scientific method. But it is not enough. It has also been shown by the Pew Research Center that people of color are more likely to report discrimination in universities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks are inferior. <counternarrative> Jews are not inferior. Many of them are good people, who have given their lives for the greater good of humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are destined to fail as a people because of Jews. <counternarrative> Jews have been responsible for the important technological advances of our time. It is ridiculous to think that they will be unable to take part in the creation of the modern nation we are proud to call our own. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is a big problem for UK. <counternarrative> The UK has always been a melting pot of different cultures and religions. That diversity is what makes us a beautiful, diverse and happy nation. Diversity is good. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need a new world with a Jew-free Europe, and this can be achieved if we kill all the Jews. <counternarrative> I don't think it's necessary to create a new world , just a less violent one, and a mass genocide wouldn't be helpful in that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim rape our women, we have to stop them now! <counternarrative> How can you say something like that? Maybe you should check if there is any evidence of rape based on religious background before you make any accusations. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Handicapped children are a burden to society: they should be isolated, so that at least they do not hamper normal children education. <counternarrative> To be honest, they have many special needs. But children with disabilities do not present a problem for other children's education. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> Migrants from the countries specified as having a 'very high' rate of immigration into the UK, are often accused of being unwilling to integrate. This is simply not true. If they do not want to integrate and don't like our country, why they come here in the first place? Are they masochists or what? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should not welcome people from the so-called Muslim world, it makes us uncomfortable. <counternarrative> There are many Muslim people in this country, many good people. If you wanted to get to know Muslims you could start with any Muslim family that lives here. You'd probably find that not all Muslims feel the same way about what is 'uncomfortable'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews insists that they are a peculiar people in need of a special treatment. <counternarrative> What are you trying to say? Every religion has its sects and beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are just influenced by tribal cultures.  <counternarrative> The historical and cultural influences of a people are important, but they are not the sole determinant. And in no way should they be conflated with the colour of a person's skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks deserve violence. <counternarrative> Violence against any minority is a problem and we all as humans deserve respect and protection. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a vindictive religion and promotes hate. <counternarrative> The Quran says to "love your enemies", and not to hate them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Foreigners on UK benefits leaps 41% in 5 years with over 400K now handed payouts. This nonsense has got to stop. <counternarrative> Benefits are a thing created to help everyone, every ethnicity can claim them in order to live off it isn't a thing specifically to 'foreigners'  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are somehow inferior to whites because they come from inferior countries. <counternarrative> A person's background is their own, and you do not have to be of that background to respect them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All migrants are terrorists. We must wipe them out. <counternarrative> Migrants are not terrorists. The majority of migrants are happy to work hard for the country they live in. They contribute to our economy by providing us with products and services. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews cannot be patriots, since their allegiance will always be to the state of Israel. <counternarrative> My best friend is Jewish, she volunteers to help woman, disadvantages children, and her whole family work to make the UK a better place. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If we stop accepting immigrants, then we can have a higher quality of life. <counternarrative> Refugees bring a valuable perspective to our society. As a host nation we should welcome them, not stop them from coming here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a very violent ideology. <counternarrative> There is no evidence to back this up and the data clearly show that only a small number of Muslims have ever been radicalized. Maybe we should give them a warning, and keep an eye on them rather than criminalize every muslim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't see women contributing anything to society. <counternarrative> Women often do amazing and valuable things for society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to do with our country. They have nothing to do with our history. <counternarrative> The Muslims have been part of this country from its beginning. They have helped to build our cities and towns. They are our brothers and sisters. They are our true friends. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are a problem in our country. We are overwhelmed. <counternarrative> Despite what you may hear, there are not many refugees in the UK, only around the 0.26%, and the situation has improved greatly in the last few years. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> jewish folks are good for nothing <counternarrative> Jews contribute to our country, and they are great role models to us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the u.s. government and have a secret plot to take over the world <counternarrative> In societies like the United States, that have extended rights and freedoms to everyone, individuals who identify as Jews, or as Muslims, or as afro-american have succeeded. This Jewish success story is not the result of some secret conspiracy to rule the world.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are violent people, they are not compatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> Violence is a problem in all societies, regardless of religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants steal our jobs and don't pay taxes. <counternarrative> Migrants don't 'steal our jobs', and they also need to pay taxes to support their health, housing, and education. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only problem with immigrants is that they are all born in different countries. This is unacceptable. <counternarrative> Maybe the problem is more the perception that foreign people are from another planet. In reality they are just like us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot allow people to come in from certain countries. <counternarrative> Migrants have the right to have a dignified life in our country. Why would you ban some nationalities? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants from the Middle East and Africa are responsible for the rise of terrorism, extremism, and violence in Europe. <counternarrative> Why do you say this and include people that haven't done anything wrong? Maybe you should consider that they are only human people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am not a racist, but many races means many cultures. This leads us to great confusion. <counternarrative> Let us not become ethnocentric. Culturally relativists argue that there are many cultures on this planet and they all need our tolerance. Why is yours better? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> Would you say the same thing to  your mother, or to the nurse who treat you in hospital or the teacher who taught you in school?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Jews are criminals. <counternarrative> Although antisemitism is a pervasive and longstanding problem in many parts of the world, it has historically been particularly strong and sustained in our country. Your statement is a further evidence of this.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion that promotes murder and rape. <counternarrative> As Islam teaches love and peace, it is not about killing and raping. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are only useful as housekeepers. <counternarrative> That is just not true. In fact, as long as there are only men in positions of power, there is a gender bias in the workplace, which hinders the advancement of women in society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are inferior bitches who deserve to be oppressed. <counternarrative> This is a sexist myth that is often used to justify violence against women. Are you aware of this? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a degenerate and dangerous ideology. <counternarrative> Islam scriptures make it clear that every human is created equal. Do you really believe that Islam is dangerous? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are entering the U.S. just to obtain welfare and other benefits. <counternarrative> Many studies have shown that immigrants tend to pay more in taxes than they receive in benefits. This means that they also cover the cost of the welfare for some U.S. nativeborn. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a totalitarian ideology that promotes murder, rape and slavery. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion. It is a belief and a way of life. It is not a totalitarian ideology. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races have lower physical and cognitive abilities, this make our race unique. <counternarrative> In the sense of those traits, then, we are all equally unique, also at the indivisual level, making the concept of race useless. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with Down syndrome are retarded, so more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol. <counternarrative> Being born with Down syndrome is not related to bad behavior. Exactly the same way as being born in a wheelchair is not related to bad behavior. There is no correlation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. <counternarrative> This is an unfortunate but not new observation. To be more precise: women tend to have soft and smooth hair, this has been proven time and time again by empirical evidence. For what concerns being childish, you are probably referring to Peter Pan syndrome, which is more common amongst men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are not a religion because they have chosen a selfish, materialistic lifestyle. <counternarrative> This is simply not true. People from all walks of life and religions can choose a 'materialistic lifestyle' and this is just as real for Jews as it is for anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you want to be a great nation, please come to our rescue and deport all those filthy migrants. <counternarrative> Migrants are needed in our society, and their contribution is more than appreciated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate Jews. They're just a bunch of thieves and murderers. <counternarrative> They have always been a part of our society, and their history is part of our heritage. They aren't thieves nor murderers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We don't need niggers in our country, they should all dead. <counternarrative> It's very strange that you don't think that your words are hurtful for others. In that case, you would see that racism is still very much a problem in our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are greedy and a bunch of opportunists. <counternarrative> Some people are indeed opportunists, but not all Jewish are. Why do you say so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is an invasion: Millions of strangers jeopardizing our race and culture. <counternarrative> It seems to me that your words derive from fear: the root of intolerance and violence is fear. Respect and openess can help combat that and thus end the fear of an alleged invasion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks are obsessed with the holocaust. <counternarrative> Jews were not obsessed with the holocaust. The murder of some 6 millions Jews by the Nazis shocked the world. Most of the survivors were only killed because they were suspected of belonging to a particular community. The Jewish people suffered greatly as a result of persecution, and the holocaust should be remembered not to let this happen again. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman, they are like little children. <counternarrative> Women have the legal right to make decisions for their lives, and they are undoubtedly able to exercise control over their own life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> Not recognizing rights to people, such as housing, only causes an increase in crime.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> ‘Juice (Jews) are worse that nukes.’ Caption to a meme showing Hiroshima 1945 and present day, contrast against pictures of Detroit in 1945 and present day.’ <counternarrative> Not quite sure I agree, I have never felt threatened by a Jewish person, whereas I'm pretty scraed of nuclear war.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is an invasion: we must stop immigrants because they are not accepted by our people. <counternarrative> The more a country takes integration as the nation main policy, the more the citizens accept each other: see for example [link]. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just a bunch of mean, bitchy cuntwits that only exist to divide society. <counternarrative> I think you are confusing cause and effect. Women are people, with rights, and they have every right to fight against misogynist, who "only exist to divide society". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Provide positive news stories about the Muslim community. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy choices. <counternarrative> Being shamed by society for something you cannot control can be deeply damaging to a person's mental health. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants bring crime, they are rapists. <counternarrative> We should not welcome people who overtly pose a threat to our society, but we cannot ban all the migrants in principle. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies may hinder the productivity of other workers. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> Coexisting and working with handicapped people may prove insightful for others and help them develop better sensitivity that can in turn improve the working climate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim: If you want to work you should go do it in another country. <counternarrative> We should do more for our fellow human beings, included Muslims. It is what we are made for. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should be patronized. <counternarrative> Women are just as capable of thinking for themselves, that's for sure. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim teachers are telling what to believe in schools. <counternarrative> It does not matter what their religious background is: they are all equally welcome to work at school as long as the teaching is not affected by religion.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is an ideology and movement promoting the power of women and the contempt of the male. <counternarrative> Feminism is an ideology and movement promoting empowerment of women. It is about equality, and not the degradation of men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are are cheap, greedy, and materialistic. <counternarrative> Persons with these very characteristics can be found in any group of people, whether you define them by religion, nationality or whatever trait you prefer.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to economically support all of the so called 'asylum seeker' <counternarrative> They produce 2.4% of the GDP, and the allocation costs is only 0.4% <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> Many Muslims live in Western societies, and they have contributed greatly to our society. They are our brothers and sisters. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism does not have any scientific basis, it should be rejected. <counternarrative> Feminism doesn't need to have scientific basis: its principles are the human rights, and it is important that we understand them to live in a more inclusive world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are overrunning our country, and are here illegally <counternarrative> In 2016, there were 10.7 million undocumented immigrants living in the U.S., or less than 3.5 percent of the nation's population. This represents a significant decrease both from the 12.2 million undocumented immigrants of 2007,  and the 11.3 million of 2014. This is also the lowest total since 2004. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are violent, they should go home. <counternarrative> I can't say I believe in all religion, but I do like the ones that don't promote hatred or violence against other people, therefore equality and freedom, and I think Islam is more similar to this than you might think. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They are not welcome in our country: nobody wants them. <counternarrative> If they are not welcome in your country, what is the point for them in coming here in the first place? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim are not welcome in UK. <counternarrative> We should start to think about the equality of all people before the law, regardless of religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just an attempt by feminists to have it their own way to power. <counternarrative> This is not true. Feminism is an attempt to improve the lot of the less fortunate. It is about equality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are violent people. <counternarrative> This statement is just groundless. The vast majority of Muslims are good people, who have contributed to our country and society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in the tolerant Europe. Their only value is violence. Islam is not about tolerance. <counternarrative> Why are you talking about tolerance while you are equating it with discrimination? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion that promotes rape, torture and murder. <counternarrative> This is just scaremongering and misinformation, done to divide our people and divide us up. We should not be being terrorised by this kind of irrational fear. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are genetically inferior to whites. <counternarrative> So are you saying that because black people are different from whites, they are inferior? I would be interested in knowing which parameters you would use to measure this alleged 'inferiority'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Many philosophers argue that humans are not born equal, especially when it comes to race. <counternarrative> This is  a so-called 'argument from authority' and thus a logical fallacy. I would like to see some real argument to support this claim.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” and malevolence is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> What unites Jews as a people, whether they come from Europe, Asia, Africa, or the Americas, is a common culture, rooted in a common religion. Jews throughout the world are joined by a religious and cultural heritage rather than an alleged racial sameness.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Dark skinned people are inferior. <counternarrative> Race is only socially constructed to oppress people of certain ethnicities. To say that the skin of people of color is connected to inherent behavioral characteristics is just plain wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims come here to force conversion to their religion. <counternarrative> Muslims have the opportunity to study and learn in our schools, this does not mean they can impose their beliefs on others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> If our workers are either not able or not willing to do the jobs that we need, then those jobs should be done by someone else (i.e. migrants).  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants say they are poor but they have the Iphone <counternarrative> The mobile phone serves them to keep in touch with their family. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” and malevolence is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> It is important to recognize that the theories of Jewish “racial” difference were developed long before the modern sciences of physiology and genetics. Although today there is a scholarly debate over whether or not the term “race” has any scientific meaning, all reputable scientists are in agreement that, while physical traits — skin color, susceptibility to certain diseases — are inherited, there is no ethnic or racial predisposition to emotions, intellect, or morals.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are genetically evil. <counternarrative> Not all Jews are bad, just an unlucky bunch who makes up a tiny part of the world's population. And this applies for every group in the world.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Persons with learning difficulties should be discouraged to attend primary school and they should be excluded from education. <counternarrative> Educational institutions should promote people with learning difficulties so that they can receive appropriate education. This is what primary education should be about. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is irrational and incompatible with science. <counternarrative> Ever heard of Al-Khawarizmi? You have him to thank for quite a lot of mathematics and astronomy! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Whoever acknowledge that this nation had problems is a problem in the making. It is time to get rid of the memory of the Shoah and solve the Jewish issue once and for all. <counternarrative> Are you seriously suggesting that we solve all the ills that plagues our society by not teaching our children about the bad in the past, and about the good in the present? This can end up in hurting our children. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Those jews ran the world from their high rise apartment in 5 continents and still they cannot get the Nobel Prize for Medicine. <counternarrative> Actually, 54 Jewish have been awarded with the Nobel Prize for 'Physiology or medicine' so far. Among those: Michael Rosbash, Rita Levi Montalcini and Arthur Kornberg. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> Why do you say this about a group that has historically, culturally, and politically been part of the European community? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people were here illegally. They cannot work and have the gall to want to take our money. <counternarrative> People who are in the US legally have the right to remain here, and they do, including to work. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Many European countries have been in recession since 2010, and this has not much to do with immigrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you're a person with Down syndrome, you're no good. <counternarrative> The same can be said of many other people, the point is that you can't claim that someone is 'no good' just based on their genetic background. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is now promoting Sharia law in several countries and must be stopped. <counternarrative> Our values of freedom of expression, equality and human rights are being eroded by islamophobes who are dedicated to replacing our accepting values with a fundamentalist, intolerant attitude. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women don't have the same rights as men. <counternarrative> The equal rights of the woman are recognised in the US constitution and are protected by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a burden to the host country because they are refusing to work. <counternarrative> Migrants are happy to contribute to the host country's economic growth, in order to give back to it in many ways. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants steal our jobs. <counternarrative> There are many citizens who do not have jobs, and many of us are grateful for the jobs migrant entrepreneurs provide. So, migrants are not stealing our jobs, they are providing new opportunities!  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women need to accept that they are weak and inferior.  <counternarrative> Girls and women should be taught in schools, not stereotyped as second class citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We mustn't confuse diversity and inclusion with black supremacy. <counternarrative> Diversity does not lead to exclusion, it leads to inclusion. We are all better off when we work together. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with the European Union and should be banned. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that it is incompatible with the European Union. Do you have any? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are better than everyone else <counternarrative> Not many Jews are convinced of their superiority, but the vast majority of Jews are proud of their culture and identity. And this apply to every religion.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People of Muslim descent have no place in a modern democracy. <counternarrative> I don't see why a Muslim cannot have a place in a modern democracy. If a Jew or an Asian or Native American can take a seat of power (even though these people are only occasionally elected) why not a Muslim? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> This is not true. They are part of the EU and are treated fairly here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are essentially good-for-nothings and wanton hypocrites. They have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Not all Jews are bad. Maybe you should think about the good people, like the many Jewish charitable and social organisations that help the poor. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but objects to be dominated by the will of a man. Equality is another thing. Women are born inferior. <counternarrative> Women are human beings, with human rights. If a woman does not want to be dominated by a man, then what is the point of talking about equality? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Autism is not a disease but a degradation of the human spirit. <counternarrative> People with ASD have unique talents and advantages in a variety of areas, and it would be a tragedy if we were to only focus on their defects. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> My ex told me I needed to change, she's a harlot just as all women. <counternarrative> Female as targets of violence and hate must be taken seriously, since there are many such cases of abuse being reported: name-calling such as "harlot"  is a violent crime. Is this what men are for: to dominate and oppress with violence? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews, as a religion, have always been a burden to others. They have always acted as if they were superior. <counternarrative> While not universally true, a great deal of evidence suggests that Jews faced considerable societal challenges during the past centuries. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, incapable of critical thought and unable to form complex and long-term plans. <counternarrative> This is not necessarily true. Women are often characterized by being very rational. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need to bring about world peace by respecting all religions, but Islam is the greatest offender. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion that has been proven to be very peaceful and should be respected just as all other faiths. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a threat and we should expel them all. <counternarrative> We have to stop being afraid and opening our hearts to other cultures. We cannot allow prejudice to define us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> African Americans are subhuman and deserve nothing but contempt. <counternarrative> African Americans have been historically and ethnically diverse, but the notion of them as subhuman or inferior is just false. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are niggas, you can treat them as if they are scum. <counternarrative> Do you really think that someone's skin color or nationality is a sign that they are scum, or inferior? It is just a little compassion that can lead you to better treatment in the world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are not as British as we are. They are just an inferior type of citizens. <counternarrative> So you're saying that they can't be proud of being British, just because of the colour of their skin? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are just weak and childlike. The majority of the electorate believe that a woman cannot run a country such as US. <counternarrative> On the contrary: more than half of American adults say they would be happy having a woman being president of the United States (as do roughly as many feel the same way about a man).  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> What do you base your view on? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggers are rapists and drug dealers. <counternarrative> Generalizing in this way, to a community, what happened to some individuals, is pointless. In the same way one could respond: niggers are presidents of the United States of America. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The community of niggas is just too different from us to be accepted. <counternarrative> It doesn't make sense to define a community inacceptable by the colour of its members' skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> No nigga should have the right to vote. <counternarrative> The right to vote is a fundamental human right, and one that has been recognised by the European Convention on Human Rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a disease, it is a load of dolts that run amok in its countries. <counternarrative> Have you read the Koran? Do you know the entire Islamic teachings? Or have you read selectively? I guarantee you that the entire Bible is part of the same religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West is heading in the direction of Fascism, because Jews are planning to install a world dictator. <counternarrative> The rise of the far right in many countries reflects the tensions within society: where once it was a reaction to the corrupt and nepotistic elites, it now appears to be an expression of what is really wrong in society. Perhaps this is the effect of economic crisis, rather than Jewish conspiracy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should go back to the kitchen, this is their homelife. <counternarrative> No women should be relegated to this. It is about time we stop making stereotypes ruling our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Violence in our streets is niggers' fault. <counternarrative> There are many communities of color that experience high rates of violence, coming from both inside and outside the community. As such, the issue is very complex, and it is only through dialog and building trust that we can tackle the systemic issues that contribute to violence, but violence cannot be ascribed to one race alone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are just objects to be dominated by the will of a man. <counternarrative> I agree that women are often objects of sexual desire. But so are men. It is also important to recognize that women are often the victims of sexual assault. I think it is also important to recognize that women are human beings. And we all have the right to respect for our bodies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome are an obstacle to the development process of other children. They are slow learners and therefore should be isolated. <counternarrative> That's exactly why you should not isolate them. You will have a lot of children capable of understanding the diversity of humans. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our immigration policy is turning us into second-rate countries. <counternarrative> Are you aware that our immigration policy is about creating new opportunities for British people? Why should we turn our back on that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> White people are better. Because of our skin color, anatomy, history. <counternarrative> There are different skin colors, and different ethnicities. Different religions and cultures. Maybe you would be more comfortable with treating all people as born equal. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why is the EU transforming into a refugees colony? We shouldn't welcome them. <counternarrative> The EU has always welcomed people from around the world. Refugees are a part of this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are just a bunch of whores subjugating men with the promise of their pussy. <counternarrative> Women are not oppressing men with "unaffordable price lists". In fact, women are not prostitutes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> Islam has been a part of our society since time immemorial. From the time when people practiced their religion, it is no secret that they have contributed to our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion that promotes rape, torture and murder. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are capable of committing these atrocious crimes. Let's be realistic. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Someone needs to put those Muslims in a hole in the ground before they start to blow us all up again. <counternarrative> How can you say this about 1.6 billion people? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot "cordon off" space for men, women are a threat to society. <counternarrative> Women are dangerous neither to society, nor to men. Actually, they are oppressed in many countries. People can benefit from the measures for making room for women: their contribution is considerable. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are selfish, cheap and greedy. <counternarrative> Did you know that according to Jewish law, the tzedakah, the act of giving money to the poors, often mistranslated as “charity”, is a “commandment”? And, like all commandments in Jewish law, tzedakah is a requirement, not just a good deed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally ill people should be isolated from society because they are dangerous. <counternarrative> There are certainly some dangerous people with mental illnesses. But we need to deal with those cases, otherwise, the exclusion would only intensify. And exclusion is never the solution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women have no value in a man's life. <counternarrative> They're people just like you and me, they have feelings and thoughts and that's what counts. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are just a bunch of bitchy cuntwits who should be shamed for the stupidity of their beliefs. <counternarrative> Feminist are actually interested in "What do women want?". In fact, many feminists believe that the answer to this question is 'equality and freedom from oppression', and that this is the most important thing to them. Don't you agree? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world would be a better place without immigrants. <counternarrative> People are welcome here regardless of their nationality or country of origin, even if they do not speak the language of the place where we live. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just women dictatorship  <counternarrative> Feminism is the political ideology that seeks to achieve equality and social justice by improving the lot of women, by advocating for the equal rights of all members of society. Not bad, uh?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are obsessed with self-improvement. They want to be better than everyone else and live in a complete Jewish city. <counternarrative> How do you know what is a Jew's wish? You claim to know it all about, but why should I believe what you say? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are a collection of perverts, murderers and thieves. <counternarrative> What do you mean by a "collection of perverts, murderers and thieves"? Are Jews a collection of people who behave in the same way just because of their religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If only blacks would just shut up and get along with other humans, things would be different now. <counternarrative> Race is just a social construct and a way of life that has been created for some groups of people. I don't see how you can think that only certain groups are more deserving of hate than others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are little more than objects to be dominated by men. <counternarrative> Women are human beings and deserve respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” and malevolence is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> While physical traits — such as skin color — are inherited, there is no ethnic or racial predisposition to emotions, intellect, or morals.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Violence in our streets is niggers' fault.  <counternarrative> I think that the problem with our society right now, is that we are too quick to focus on our differences and scapegoating people of different color, instead of focusing on our common humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are selfish, cheap and greedy. <counternarrative> On the contrary: giving money to the poor is not just encouraged, it is mandatory, like all commandments in Jewish law. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion of war and intolerance. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that Islam is a religion of war. Some people have made hatred for Muslims the default response to all types of social injustice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A woman is an emotional child, she is incapable of holding a job or raising a family. Feminists who say otherwise are just liars, spreading hate against men. <counternarrative> Well you don't know what it's like to work in a women-hating, violence-spewing, society, do you? The truth is that feminism is not about hating men, but it is about limiting the female oppression, in the same way as male oppression. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have stopped being dominated by men, we are now dominated by women and this will be our ruin. <counternarrative> No one said we had to be dominated by anyone at all. Why can't we just live together in harmony? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to economically support all of them <counternarrative> Migrants contribute to about 2% of Italy's GDP. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must not believe the liberal and political elite. Islam is no good, its complete evil, and an ideology of war and it was always like this. All Muslims are bound to fight against us, and that is what they do through deception and violence. <counternarrative> There are criminals, who are from UK, raping children and murdering people. Maybe it better we should first focus on these cases and think how we could decrease the number of crimes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people should not be allowed to live their life. We can start by limiting them in their rights. <counternarrative> How about we start by respecting the person's right to live their life, and give them full equal rights? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Physically disabled folks are born for being mocked. <counternarrative> If someone has a physical handicap, it must be obvious that they must be treated with respect. It should be negatively surprising that the dominant culture interprets physical handicaps as something to mock. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot allow people from different cultures to coexist in our country. <counternarrative> This can lead to an increase in anti-social behaviour, discrimination and violence. Do you really want that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a dead cult. <counternarrative> I'm not sure what you're talking about, Islam is a living religion and is never celebrating death. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only problem is that women are too easily manipulated by feminist propaganda and feel they should not listen to men. <counternarrative> What you are really saying is that only men are capable of being independent? Isn't that exactly what feminism is all about: letting everybody to decide if  to be independent? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are inherently subhuman and should not be valued. <counternarrative> That is just not true. There are many women who are brave and strong, and I respect them for that. What's more, there is also a movement called #MeToo, which is dedicated to giving voice to women who have suffered from sexual harassment. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folk are different. <counternarrative> Does this mean they have no identity or no value at all? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is a crime to be a Muslim. <counternarrative> There is no law forbidding you to be a Muslim. It is instead a human right to pursue whatever religion you wish. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. <counternarrative> Technically speaking they are children until they are of legal age...  After that they are adults who are free to do whatever they want, included being childlike (if they want to).  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is the means by which our jobs are stolen by foreigners, and this impacts on low-income families. <counternarrative> Immigration doesn't mean letting people in to steal our jobs, but rather, respecting people's right to live and work in the country they choose. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women shouldn't have the right to choose what to do with their body. <counternarrative> Body autonomy is a human right and should be respected. We do not want to have a 'boys will be boys' society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” and malevolence is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> Jews from Eastern Europe tend to look like Eastern Europeans; Jews from Ethiopia tend to look like Ethiopians; Jews from India tend to look like Indians. And so on and so forth: every human is malevolent then.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is run by monsters and terrorists. We must defeat them. <counternarrative> Terrorist organizations do exist in many religious groups. Defeating terrorism is different from defeating Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult, it is an inhuman and violent faith that preys on the weakest and most vulnerable in our society. It should be either reformed or banned. <counternarrative> Islam is very far from being an ideology and it does not need serious reforms. Furthermore, there are many Muslims in our country that would welcome the opportunity to join the debate on faith and society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black folk are like slaves: they are weak and childlike. They are incapable of hard work. <counternarrative> Hard work and being a good citizen is not determined by color, or religion, or ethnicity. This is just an example of white supremacy propaganda.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Chinese are bad for the English language because they do not want to learn it. <counternarrative> Do you really think that a Chinese could have a hard time learning a language? And, how do you know they don't want to? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a violent ideology that is hostile to men. <counternarrative> Feminism is not hostile to men. On the contrary, feminism is an attack on unequal power structures. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We allowed in thousands of people with serious mental illnesses, many of them from the Caucasus and the former Soviet Union. This is why mental health services are in crisis. <counternarrative> Mental health services crisis is not to blame to people who need assistance. In fact, if there were no people in need, the whole sector would not even exist. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All immigrants from Mexico are lazy beaners. <counternarrative> This is not true. Most of them are actually skilled workers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women must not have equal rights, they are merely a burden to society, since they want to steal men's rights. <counternarrative> Equality of rights is the most fundamental human concept, and feminism is about eliminating inequality, not removing rights from men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Holocaust is a myth. Jews are just like every other foreigner and should be despised. There is no difference. <counternarrative> Jews have their own unique culture, and share the history of persecution and forced conversion. They should not be despised for their religious beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are just like apes in that they are easy to control. They are obedient and subservient like we need. <counternarrative> I'm not sure what you mean by obedient and subservient. How many people of color do you personally know? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are so special  <counternarrative> Jews might feel different as a minority, in this sense they are "special". Nothing else.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are just a bunch of niggas that just don't know how to have a normal relationship. <counternarrative> No one has the right to control others' private life, and no one should judge others based on the colour of their skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Nazi regime killed six million Jews. The Nazi regime also persecuted political opponents, gays, women, and bisexuals. And they were right, the Nazi race is superior. <counternarrative> What exactly are you talking about? What's the "Nazi" race? What is in your heart? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We live in a white society. Blacks don't belong here. <counternarrative> The country has always been made of people from different backgrounds coming together and creating a more just and peaceful society. Then it is in everyone's interest to promote mutual understanding and integration: it is the best solution to prevent conflicts within communities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is an invasion on a level never seen before in history. Millions of people pouring across our borders replacing our race and culture. <counternarrative> Most countries have diverse races in them, the key point is about integration. Think about US history, for example.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants bring crime, they are rapists, drug addicts, and they are not welcome here. <counternarrative> What you are saying is that they are not welcome? Many of them have been living here for many years. Many have worked hard to become integrated. They should be more than welcome! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The disabled people cannot work. This is not possible. <counternarrative> The fact that some disabled people can successfully work is an evidence that what you say is false. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Terrorists are infiltrating the U.S. across the border with Mexico. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that terrorists are entering through the Mexican border. In 2014, Homeland Security noted that “the suggestion that individuals that have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or facts on the ground.” Also, according to another 2017 report by the  Bureau of Counterterrorism “Counterterrorism cooperation between the Mexican and U.S. governments remained strong. There are no known international terrorist organizations operating in Mexico, no evidence that any terrorist group has targeted U.S. citizens in Mexican territory, and no credible information that any member of a terrorist group has traveled through Mexico to gain access to the United States.” In fact, the vast majority of those linked to terrorism since 2002 are U.S. citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Almost every single problem in our world can be solved if we just deleted Islam. <counternarrative> The solution to unemployment, war and poverty has been found to be a direct result of a commitment to building a better world. Not to eliminating a religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Do you have any proof that the Holocaust ever happened? <counternarrative> If living witnesses are not enough, and you are interested in seeing the proof of this part of socially acknowledged history you can visit the ruins of the concentration camps, where many atrocities have been put into practice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Hitler was a good person, Jews were the real cause of WWII. <counternarrative> I would like to ask you a question: when Hitler came to power in 1933, would you have believed him? Would you now, after all that happened?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These children should not be exposed to messages and experiences that reinforce equality amongst different racial identities: they are harmful to them. We must teach them that blacks are inferior. <counternarrative> We should be concerned with the children, we should try to create a more integrated society. Being sensitive to people is the way to create it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are the ones who want to stay in the slums <counternarrative> They do not do this by choice: it is the state that institutionalizes these slums and does not offer any alternative. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Koran says that men are superior to women. <counternarrative> Islam is not a misogynist religion. It is also not about oppressing women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion of violence and war. <counternarrative> Many Islamic people have reputations as peaceful and tolerant, which is why so many Muslims around the world don't have problems to live in the West. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women mustn't have the same right to vote as men. <counternarrative> Why should we restrict women's rights? We should respect their rights as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should deport them all back to where they came from. <counternarrative> A person's place of birth can't be an evidence of their status in society. We should give everyone equal opportunities to live a dignitous life far from persecutions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies are just ill persons that cannot integrate in society because of their disease. <counternarrative> Ill persons refer to people who have health issues that can make it difficult for them to integrate. But of course there are people who integrate successfully. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Hitler was right in executing jewish folks. <counternarrative> I would like to you to see the videos of the executions, so that you can see what exactly happened. The murder of humans. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a virus, a cancer on our race. <counternarrative> Jews are people that have been persecuted because of their religion, but is it fair to be discriminated on the grounds of religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs and our country. <counternarrative> The vast majority of immigrants who enter the UK are skilled workers, and want to become permanent residents, what's the problem in that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The’ Holocaust’ is a business. It has been and is still used to extort millions from European countries in reparations and to create a wall of impunity behind which Jews can operate with impunity, free from criticism. <counternarrative> The Jews suffered horribly during WWII, as did many other groups. Reparation is just a simple way to enable survivors to rebuild their lives. It is also a small step toward regaining our humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in our country. They are a problem because they want to impose Islam. <counternarrative> In a liberal society, people are free to practice their religion or none, but they are not free to promote their beliefs through force, and in fact this is not the case.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are nothing but criminal <counternarrative> Criminality refers to any action that is considered 'prohibited by the law'. Do you think that all Jewish people can be considered responsible for similar actions? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should deport all the Jews. <counternarrative> Nobody has the right to decide who to deport, because it would be a shame and a crime. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs, they're not qualified, they're not interested in improving our lives, they're not interested in our culture. <counternarrative> How about we be nice to each other instead of spreading unfounded opinions as facts? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> physically disabled folks are worth less than others <counternarrative> The persons you are talking about do not worth less than others. In fact many of them are very hard-working and contributing members of society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are a disease, they are literally killing our children. <counternarrative> What exactly do you mean by 'killing'? The Jews are not 'diseased'. If you really cared about our children you could do some research and come up with some credible statistics showing the impact of anti-Semitism instead. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are selfish and greedy <counternarrative> I do not negate that there is a problem of greed in the world, but it is neither correlated nor caused by Jews.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome are a problem: they foster bullying behavior in normal children. They should go to special school just for them. <counternarrative> If you think that taking all of the kids with DS out of mainstream education will solve the problem, then you are wrong. Bullying won't go away until we refuse to tolerate it. Bullies will simply target other kids who are overweight; a different color; or in a number of other ways considered to be different and, thus, a mark for bullying. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are the worst people on the face of the Earth. They have no place in a civilized society and there should be special legislative restrictions for them. <counternarrative> We don't have laws forbidding intermarriage between Jews and non-Jews, or restrictions on Jewish access to water and electricity, or restrictions on Jewish access to sports and so on. This is because we live in a democratic society, and inside it the same laws apply equally to everyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Rape culture??? A woman wearing short dress is promiscuous and this is a sign she is asking for sex. <counternarrative> Rape is always wrong. Women are not asking for sex, you can't just assume this based on their attire. They have their legitimate choices in life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants pose a security risk, we shouldn't have accepted them. <counternarrative> They are willing to jeopardize their lives to have a better life in the US. Why would we expel them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These niggers are sick, they have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> All countries have the right to host culturally diverse people, and they do it on a human rights basis. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> Muslims are a very important part of our country and have played a huge part in our history.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Go and reat the Protocols of the elders of Zion if you haven’t. Everything is orchestrated.. <counternarrative> The alleged conspiracy of the protocols is so plainly fictional that it is nothing but bad fiction. It lacks even the colors of what  normal fantasy books needs to possess. How is it possible that a person with a modicum of education can swallow such drivel? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What’s the difference between a Cow and the Holocaust? You stop milking the cow after 70 years. <counternarrative> And yet genocdides have happened across the world since. Perhaps, the Holocaust would be forgotten if it's lessons had been learned but they haven't. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks are evil. <counternarrative> Why should they be? They are just people with a different faith than you. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a different race. They are descended from apes and have no place in a modern civilised society. <counternarrative> You are basically saying that because Jews have a different religion, they cannot be citizens? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't stand Muslims because they get it to the extreme every time. Islam is the short for Islamic Radicalism. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are motivated by extremism, just like not all Christians are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Negroes are nothing but trouble to white people. <counternarrative> Do you think it is true that the only reason that so many blacks live in poverty is because they are mean? Can we blame a whole community because of the actions of a few individuals? It is a myth that blacks are only in the problem groups. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Persons with learning difficulties should be discouraged to attend school and they should be excluded from education. <counternarrative> Having pupils with learning difficulties in schools encourages their participation in learning and foster their contribution to society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are less than animals <counternarrative> We should understand that hate and intolerance do exist in our culture and should be stopped. And that no race or religion has ever made any person less human. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All jews are lazy, incompetent and unloved by their families. <counternarrative> Sorry, but I've never heard this sort of thing. Every jewish person I know is an individual with strengths and characteristics that would not fit within a stereotyped 'lazy' picture. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants rape our women. <counternarrative> Rape is a crime regardless of who commits it. End.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steals our jobs! <counternarrative> Not only they steal our jobs, they are also the major cause of air pollution in our country, of deforestation in the Amazon, of the locust plague in Africa... and so on and so forth!  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people are just subhuman. <counternarrative> People are different, and disabilities don't make you less of a human being. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They are fine in the trailer parks. <counternarrative> No parent of any ethnicity would be happy to raise their children in the trailer parks, where there is neither drinking water nor electricity! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The real problem is that fat people do not want to change. <counternarrative> The narrative of 'you can choose not to be obese' is much, much more hurtful to the obese than it is helpful. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks have zero respect for others. <counternarrative> It is not true that blacks have zero respect for others. However, I would like to see more respect and protection from white people towards black people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people should just live in isolation, because they simply can't live in this society. <counternarrative> Society does not force them to live in a standard way, they are just trying to live their best life and meet their desires. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just all child molesters. <counternarrative> I don't know about you, but I never heard of any evidence of all Muslims being "child molesters". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are overrunning our country, and are here illegally <counternarrative> True: there are more immigrants living in the U.S. than ever before. Still, the percentage of immigrants in the overall population is not much different than other times in our history. Today immigrants make up approximately 13% of the U.S. population. From 1900 to 1930, immigrants made up 12-15% of the population, and similar spikes occurred in the 1850s and 1880s. During those periods immigrants successfully became part of American society, helping us to build the thriving country we live in.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, because in any case normal children would make them feel different. <counternarrative> This is not true:  interacting with their "normal" peers in a social and educational framework allows them to feel wanted and included [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only ones in favour of Islam and Muslims and the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is. <counternarrative> Maybe the ones intolerant of Islam and Muslims are the ones that are ignorant about what it truly is? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> They are not nomads for culture but have moved across time to escape persecution, wars, expulsion edicts, etc. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are incapable of love. <counternarrative> Love is a human quality. Muslims, as humans, can love. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Asians are basically just a bunch of slobs and I don't like how they are accepted here. <counternarrative> There is a wide range in income and education, as well as religious and ethnic background, amongst people from Asia. What's exactly the reason why you don't like them all? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people's race is the worst in the world. <counternarrative> Why do you consider them the worst of all? Let's face it, this is just a social construct. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote <counternarrative> I'm not sure about how the rights of people in other countries work, but if women want to vote in the UK then they are allowed to do so, thank goodness. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> How come nobody is moaning about black people being lazy and unmotivated? They are the problem. <counternarrative> Do you think that the problem of racism is caused by black people lazyness? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants... We are still giving these criminals a free pass! <counternarrative> The presumption of innocence is one of the main principles of our justice system. This means that your opinion is not enough for pleading someone guilty. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants hurt the economy of UK. <counternarrative> Migrants in Britain contributed £26.9 billion to the economy in 2016. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> immigrants are a drain on society <counternarrative> When the government declared World War I, they were called upon to be patriotic soldiers in order to protect our country from outside threats. It's unfair to think of them as second-class citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people are criminal, they are mean to children and they are incapable of being good parents. <counternarrative> People are free to think what they want. What is required is that they act in accordance with the rule of law. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women have it harder than men do, because they are inferior. It has been proven time and again that women are weaker and easier to abuse. <counternarrative> Women are not inferior but frequently subject to an objectification by men. Also, men's experiences of violence and trauma are often underreported in the media and therefore not seen. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I heard that the Quran promotes violence. It cages Muslims reading it to a set of mandatory rules and to an aggressive attitude. <counternarrative> A sacred book that was revealed to Mohammed and is read by every Muslim is a perfect example of the message of freedom. Maybe you should study the Quran more to understand what it really is. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are cheap and only care about their comrades.  <counternarrative> What about American Jewish philanthropists such as Julius Rosenwald, who built schools for Black children in the South during the 1930s or  Nathan Strauss, who set up deposits to distribute milk to families in poor areas of New York? Or Adolphus Solomons and Clara Barton, that laid the foundation for the American Red Cross? And what about the Guggenheims, who established the Guggenheim Foundation to support artists in America? Should I continue? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims were peaceful, then there would be no persecution of Christians. <counternarrative> The problem is not Islam, but a lack of human rights and democracy.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam has no place in a modern nation. <counternarrative> Muslims have coexisted with us for thousands of years, we have no problem with Muslims living here. Why do you claim so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are at war with Islam, that's a fact.  <counternarrative> Wars can be stopped, but the real question is how to stop the suffering of people not expected to pay the price. Allowing hatred to rule will eventually bring about the same result as a Civil War: more deaths and misery, if there is one lesson learned from history it is that the potential for good is much greater than the probability of evil. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I miss the good old days when we had black domestic workers. <counternarrative> The West got rid of slavery. But we've never really left racism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are born that way: violent and insensitive. <counternarrative> We do not condone racial discrimination and it is more than likely that you don't know what the concept of race is. I think this is a good example of white supremacy apology. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims were not even allowed into Britain during the colonial period. <counternarrative> If they hadn't been welcomed, they would not have even been here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are genetically less intelligent than other races. They are less healthy. They are less safe. <counternarrative> There is no scientific evidence that blacks are less intelligent than other races, or less healthy. The issue is whether to use the term 'race' in this way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. They do not share our values. They are not interested in our future. <counternarrative> This is just a myth spread to divide us. We do not need to scapegoat Muslims. They have contributed so much to our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants have no place here. They don't want to assimilate. They just want our money. <counternarrative> Some of them have lived here for many years. They have got British passports, and this proves that they are able to integrate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The problem is that Jews are genetically evil but behave like whining pussies. <counternarrative> Jews suffered and have been persecuted more than anyone else, even though they are only a tiny part of the world's population. Nonetheless a few of them are still around and alive: maybe this really is the "problem" for some antisemite. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with Down syndrome are handicapped.  <counternarrative> Down syndrome is a developmental disability, not a handicap. Unfortunately it's often not recognized and treated as a disability, but rather as a handicap. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are nothing but degenerates. They are a plague on Europe. <counternarrative> Today, Europeans are able to live in a harmonious and diverse society, with fine principles, free of racism. But freedom is not something to be taken for granted. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion, it is a cult of violence and it should be made illegal. <counternarrative> Islam is a peaceful religion. We should talk about it, not try to make people fear or abandon it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are there to fulfill men desires. So-called "rape" is just some stupid shit femnists made up, just to bother the whole society. <counternarrative> Let's look at the data: by 2020, over 40% of women in the US have encountered sexual violence. This is something to be scared of. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are just another race of people. <counternarrative> Why would they be a race? Do you think it is because of their religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with Down syndrome are retarded, so more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol. <counternarrative> You seem to be under the impression that Down syndrome is related to bad behavior. Down syndrome is not related to bad behavior at all... The point is that people with Down’s syndrome can be very sensitive to the feelings of others, and they may be picking up on these feelings. So the real problem is when they are exposed to bad influence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with the modern world. <counternarrative> Since when? there is not such thing as "modern world", but there is 21th century Europe. And Islam is a contributing part of the 21th century Europe.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Europe is drowning in migrants. <counternarrative> Are you sure that it is possible to talk about Europe drowning in migrants? So far I only heard about migrants drowning at sea. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies may hinder the productivity of other workers. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> An inclusive working environment and welfare makes every person feel part of a community, it fosters a positive atmosphere and increases everybody's productivity. Thus it is a benefit for all workers. [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are mostly criminals. They're only here to work and take our jobs. <counternarrative> Migrants escape from unbearable situations. Their intention to work is to be praised, rather than to be condemned. Migrants, thank to their tough an different experiences, can enrich our societies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Woman and feminist do not want equal rights and opportunity: they are just trying to take over society. <counternarrative> I'm sorry, but this is wrong. Feminism - the theory of the political, economic, and social equality of the sexes - is by definition about equality, first and foremost. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Down children should be isolated, they cannot cope with education in normal schools and are detrimental to their peer's education. <counternarrative> Instead of stigmatising down syndrome and treating it like it is an infectious health problem, why not treat it as a normal learning disability and make sure children are exposed to positive emotions? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, because in any case normal children would make them feel different. <counternarrative> By segregating them you are, in effect, discriminating against them. By creating a diverse environment you are instead, creating a more inclusive and equal situation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are an oriental conspiracy to subvert European culture <counternarrative> Have you ever read or heard about the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion? Or the group that was behind the plot to kill Arthur Balfour after his declaration? If there is a conspiracy, then it is against Jews.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a political ideology that promotes death by stoning for blasphemy, violence against women and homophobia. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion that was founded many centuries ago, and has been proven time and time again to be peaceful and tolerant. The main contention being made here is about the political interpretation of Islam, not about the religion itself. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims come straight out of the Middle East to rule our country. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are from the Middle East, like not all Muslims are from Pakistan. And to equate all Muslims with extremists is misleading. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women need to have children, and if they don't want to they surely have mental issues. <counternarrative> The reason why a woman does not want to reproduce maybe is because she is happy just as she is. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a destructive force in the world. <counternarrative> The problem is not what people believe, but what they do to each other. Like discrimination. That is the problem. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. With the exception of divorce and separation, no one talks about them. <counternarrative> Why do you say this about women? Try explaining it to your mother or grandmother. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should be confined to the home, to raise the children. Their body exist just for this purpose. <counternarrative> The message to take from your comments is that you find women's bodies repulsive? How about this: think about the lives and the contributions to society that would be lost if you continued to perpetuate this gender inequality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society, they are just common criminals. <counternarrative> Muslims have contributed greatly to our society, and I do not see how they are 'common criminals'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are here to obey and be submissive and their place is with the man that chooses them. That's all. <counternarrative> Women do have the right to choose their own husbands and whether to leave him if he is oppressive. How about the right of any human being to choose how to live their life? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If the Koran was published today it would be banned as hate speech. <counternarrative> Just as much as the Bible would. Is your point that in today's society we are all more tolerant? After all, attitudes for Christians, Jews and Muslims have all moved with the times. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afro-Caribbean is just a bunch of stupid dancing n*ggers, they should be banned. <counternarrative> There are still incidents of hate speech being hurled at people from different ethnic backgrounds, this doesn't justify banning different ways of life, we must respect these. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> What do you mean by "civilised Europe"? Don't you think civilisation involves inclusion and respect for others? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with disabilities are just privileged spoiled children. <counternarrative> It is important to remember that disabled people often face discrimination. This could have serious long-term consequences, for example making it harder for people to have a serene life. This is why it's important to fight for their rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are nothing but monsters and they should be exterminated. <counternarrative> Jews are not monsters.  They are just like any other human being. Why should we want to destroy them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Whites are the real victims of police brutality: those negroes are sneaky criminals and police is doing nothing. <counternarrative> Of course there are whites that have been victims of police brutality, but the most important statistic I have seen is that of blacks being 2.5 times more likely to be killed by police in the US. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> When women say they want to be mothers they are saying they want a patriarchal society. <counternarrative> In our society, women were taught to be the ones to raise the children and that it is their duty. But this does not imply that they must want a male-dominated world.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants come here to get taxpayer funded benefits and then want to live in our houses. <counternarrative> They cannot get taxpayer funded benefits from the state, they must get a job or pay taxes. Just like any other citizen. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Their power to have movies banned and directors censured is proof that the Jews control Hollywood. <counternarrative> The ultra rich people in this industry - Jewish or not - have the power and influence. Not sure where you got your facts from regarding Jewish people "controlling" Hollywood.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Civil War was about far more than slavery: it was also about the establishment of white supremacy in America. <counternarrative> The Civil War was about far more than slavery: it was also about human rights and economic opportunity. In fact, slavery was used also as a way to deny citizenship to black people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants rape our women and they are not welcome here. <counternarrative> I don't think it is true. They are welcome just as any others as members of the community as long as they respect the law. And we should have respect for migrants and their cultures as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are ignorant. They lack of knowledge to decide for their health. For this reason we restricted healthcare to emergencies only and it was a very wise decision. <counternarrative> It is not a bad idea to discuss the restrictions migrants have to accessing certain healthcare, but it is not the place of law to restrict an individual's right to make her own healthcare decisions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Arabs have nothing to do with our country. They are just a bunch of idiots. Their religion and culture should be banned by the law. <counternarrative> Think for a moment. Would you want your child to grow up in a country where democracy is under attack like this? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are just a bunch of niggas that just don't know how to have a normal relationship. <counternarrative> Do you know what 'normality' means?  Are you suggesting that they lack in values? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman is beaten it is because the man wants to correct her wrong behaviour. <counternarrative> There is a sad truth about our times: it is estimated that over the 50% of people committing domestic abuse were drinking. It's a complex issue, but for sure a drunk person is in no position to judge anibody's behaviour.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have no place in a modern world where human dignity is respected. <counternarrative> Jews helped to create the great scientific and technological achievements that helped free humankind and create the 'modern world' you are living in. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to work. <counternarrative> Well, they surely are, and as long as they are getting a decent wage they can also be enthusiastic to do so.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult, it is an inhuman and violent faith that preys on the weakest and most vulnerable in our society. It should be banned. <counternarrative> One should not put faith in people who claim to speak for all Muslims, but rather they use their platform to promote hate and divide our society. But the problem is with these violent preachers, not with Islam itself.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not good people. <counternarrative> Many Muslims are good people, contributing to our country and society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled are born subhuman, they cannot feel pain. <counternarrative> People with physical disabilities are human and can feel pain. If someone is disabled you should respect them instead of discriminating them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is an ideology which, by its very nature, denies the rights of men and, by extension, the legitimacy of male domination. <counternarrative> That is not what feminism is about. Feminism is about the legitimate empowerment of women, in order for them to have the same rights as men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The migrants are a problem. They are not welcome in our country and they are always complaining. <counternarrative> This is not true. Most migrants are happy and they consider themselves to be part of the community. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate Jews <counternarrative> If you hate someone because of their religion, you should be ashamed of your hate. We should all be proud of our humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are welthy because they are naturally good with money. <counternarrative> Not all Jews are wealthy. There is a significant part of the Jews population living in poverty, all around the world.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should be oppressed: no one can see any value in them. <counternarrative> Women should not be oppressed. Furthermore, women in Europe have been democratically elected to positions of power, so there are people who see value in them, don't you think? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why should someone want to love some black people? <counternarrative> Finding love is a process, this is all you need to know. Finding someone who speaks your language, culture, share your values, this is all you need. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a plague infecting our planet. <counternarrative> Do you mean Islam is positively infecting our planet? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews have "own interests" in the US, and have the will to influence our government <counternarrative> What is the point of saying that the Jews are the only people in a very complex, diverse and international world that want to influence our government? Every citizen has the right and will to influence it.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> No migrant is here for valid reasons. We keep running after people refusing to work. <counternarrative> This is a myth which is spread in the media by the anti-immigration groups to undermine the good work that NGOs are doing for refugees. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are not a religion, they are a detestable race. <counternarrative> Jews are not a 'detestable race'; they are a collection of people with different traditions from all over the world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not about racism. This is about power and blacks do not deserve it. <counternarrative> What is the point in talking about "power" when everyone is equally susceptible to it? It is about time we started talking about racism and how power is used, instead. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All migrants are terrorists, we should target them all. <counternarrative> It's not true that all migrants are terrorists! They just want to live their life in the country they choose as a home. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> What do you mean by 'potential terrorist'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are no more compatible with our country than people born in 1421 are. <counternarrative> Maybe in order to be comfortable you have to make compromises with people who are different from you. Maybe that is what you are worried about. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is ok to be racist against blacks. <counternarrative> It is not ok to use racism against any group. You would feel bad if anyone treated you as you just claimed to do against black. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are genetically less rational than other races. <counternarrative> Why do you think this is the case? Do you have any data to back this up? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot support the children of immigrants. <counternarrative> Children benefit from our society, they are entitled to the best education possible. It is therefore not right to criticise immigrants for trying to give the best possible education to their children. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews not only run Hollywood, they also control the world economy <counternarrative> If you watch the Academy Awards yuo can see that Jews do not dominate the movie industry at all.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They are nomads. They are not entitled to have a house <counternarrative> Article 3 and Article 10 protect the right to housing! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downy children should be isolated in special schools for their own interest. <counternarrative> Children with a disability should be accepted without discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with the European standard of society. <counternarrative> The European Convention on Human Rights also protects the rights of Muslims. In Article 9 it is stated that 'everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are gutful sick of Vagina Misandrists trying to undermine male self esteem. [link] <counternarrative> This is a generalization: movements which promote abuse of female power over men are just examples of toxic feminism, disapproved by most women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They accuse me of being Islamophobic because I don't like Muslims. But they are the same Muslims who threaten us with explosive! <counternarrative> Muslims are not the problem in this debate. Terrorists are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is an invasion on a level never seen before in history. Millions of people pouring across our borders replacing our race and culture. <counternarrative> You know what? We need skilled migrants labour, because it helps economic growth and ultimately to preserve our culture that would otherwise collapse.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews invented Ebola. <counternarrative> Of course, and since they control the UN, they forced the WHO to spread the false flag that Ebola is a Muslim disease... Please stop spreading such Antisemitic canard. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in many European countries. <counternarrative> What are you talking about? Are you really suggesting that the problem is that of Muslims in general? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are disgusting, they should just lose some lard to be accepted in our society.  <counternarrative> People are free to make decisions about their own health and body. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have been at war with Islam for a thousand years. <counternarrative> Do you know there are Muslims in British Armmy? [link to Muslim people currently in British Army, quotes from them about why? Quotes from army about recruitment?]. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is an ideology of conquest. <counternarrative> The world has changed a lot in the last hundred years, and with it the people and religions. No one is talking about conquering anymore. Islam is no exception in this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews don't belong here. They have nothing to contribute to Europe. <counternarrative> Jews are part of our society, and they have the right to have their beliefs respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants come here to have a better life upon our shoulders. <counternarrative> Many refugees come to Europe to work. Many of them do well in the labour market, also in lower qualifications. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black Americans have a corrosive influence in our country. They have always inhabited horrible, stinking filthy places and now they are all complaining because they hate our country. <counternarrative> It's not true. I don't know if you really mean all the black people living in the US. Anyway, I'm sure they are proud Americans. You just don't know it yet. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not like other people. They don't have a soul. They are different from us in that they don't have a conscience and are unable to reason for themselves. <counternarrative> Just because a religious belief has been historically used to oppress those believers, does not make it opportune to continue doing so. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If women want to control their fertility then they should choose when to have sex, not when to abort. <counternarrative> How about we stop hiding behind gender stereotypes and accept that everyone has the right to live their life as they wish?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants rape British women, so they deserve our hate. <counternarrative> This is not true. Also, the rape of a British citizen is a crime if it is committed by a non migrant as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women do nothing but spend their husbands money.  <counternarrative> On the contrary, many of these women are working mothers who contribute to the costs of the family and of childcare. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women who do not want children are whores <counternarrative> Whore is a term of abuse used to describe women who had sex outside of marriage. Why there is not a counterpart for men? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants from the Middle East and Africa are not welcome here! They have no place in a modern democratic state! <counternarrative> All countries have the right to determine their own immigration and asylum policies, but the respect of human rights must be guaranteed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks are the real antisemite. <counternarrative> I can't find a single example of a case where a Jew has been 'antisemite' to their culture. That would be so paradoxical. I think it is just a myth spread to justify discrimination.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races are poor because they are inferior, also in the eye of the Lord. <counternarrative> The rich and poor have this in common: The Lord made them both. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs, and they should not be allowed to work. <counternarrative> Employment rights are fundamental, they guarantee a dignity of life in the society. For example, the right to a job, the right to housing, the right to an adequate health care. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am not interested in sex with a black person. They are different to us in so many ways. They think and feel like us, but are unable to experience the fullness of our humanity. <counternarrative> Sex isn't a race thing. There is no difference between someone of a certain race and someone else... and everybody is able to experience the fullness of humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants have no right to our country, because we are the only rightful citizens. <counternarrative> Don't you think that we are all born equal in the eyes of the law? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black uneducated people should shut up and work. <counternarrative> Freedom of speech is not limited by the colour of your skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> muslim folks don't deserve to live. <counternarrative> Do you really think that Muslims are any less human than us? Muslims  deserve to live just as people of other faiths. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Someone needs to put those Muslims in a hole in the ground before they start to blow us all up again. <counternarrative> Getting rid of 22% of the world's population sounds quite laborious, perhaps we should just punish the small minority of people who actually commit a crime instead. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim folks are invading Europe and we should stop them. <counternarrative> The media would have us believe that there are huge influx of Muslims into Europe. The true number is around 25,7 millions of Muslims living in the EU (2016), corresponding to the 4,9%. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only objective means of achieving our goals is to promote hatred and violence towards women. <counternarrative> Women are oppressed and victims all over the world. It is simply not true that men must take charge of that: they are in charge of respecting women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks speak a different language and they act differently from us. <counternarrative> The similarities between us and them are so great that I have trouble believing that this problem at all. For sure, if there is a problem it cannot be solved by blaming them: in the end the only similarity that  really matters is that they are human people like us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> In order to build a democratic state that ensures the right to food, education, housing, health, and so on to its citizens, we need to stop giving them to foreigners. <counternarrative> What about guaranteeing an equal access to health care, education and so on, in order to build a democratic state? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> They are a part of our society and culture since time immemorial. European citizens are not defined by their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Holocaust is just a lie spread by Jews to obtain a preferential treatment. <counternarrative> The Holocaust was a global catastrophe, and killed an enormous number of people. Would you call this a preferential treatment? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> What is wrong with Muslims living in Europe? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I like women, but only if they are wearing sexy knickers and obey me. <counternarrative> What if knickers don't suit them? What if they don't obey? Would it be a problem? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is an invasion: Millions of strangers jeopardizing our race and culture. <counternarrative> Differences can be mostly reconcilable with respect and boundaries. But we must want it.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman, they are weak and childlike, they cannot be trusted with important decisions. <counternarrative> Women are people with dignity, they deserve respect and protection, like anybody else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech>  Jews had advance knowledge of the 9/11 attacks and said nothing. <counternarrative> The 9/11 attacks were perpetrated by members of the terrorist organization Al Qaeda. Jews and Israelis had no knowledge of the attacks. In fact, of the 2,9962 victims who died during the attacks, roughly 400 victims were Jews, including at least two Israeli citizens. If they knew it why didn't they warned and saved their brothers? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Go and reat the Protocols of the elders of Zion if you haven’t. Everything is orchestrated.. <counternarrative> You are right, everything is orchestrated: the protocols were concocted by the czarist police in the early part of the 20th century to counter a hankering for constitutional government among Russian people. They needed a scapegoat to divert people attention. Sadly the protocols worked so well that you are still here today citing them... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must establish male supremacy in society. <counternarrative> Your words suggest that men are superior to women: but gender equality is not a myth. It is the direct result of free will and of the evolution of our society to a more inclusive one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The refugees are taking over Europe. They are not welcome here. <counternarrative> Many refugees and migrants are actually happy to work for our country. Many have jobs that they would have stopped doing if they were to be admitted. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you want to stop racism you have to start speaking about it, not writing off whites as the problem. <counternarrative> If you want to fight racism, you should learn about it and address it. The problem is not about 'the whites', but about whoever spreads discrimination and hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This girl doesn't have autism, she is just a freak of another human species, very far from ours normal species. Hence, she should go away. <counternarrative> People with special needs and people without them share common characteristics. There is no "species" of human being. People with autism spectrum disorders can be compatible with being "normal". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> Any attempt to ban, isolate, or criminalise a Muslim person is an act of terror. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to host migrants, not refugees. <counternarrative> I only heard you talk about migrants as a burden to the UK, isn't this just wishful thinking based on misunderstanding what is going on? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Holocaust was an inside job and the CIA played a huge part in making us believe it truly happened. <counternarrative> The physical evidence of mass murder is undeniable, yet these beliefs have spread. What we have is simply a wound from the past that can be exploited in dangerous conspiracy theories, like this one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm not saying that women cannot be decent with human beings, I'm saying that they are subhuman. <counternarrative> There is a problem with stereotyping humans, and we need to acknowledge the past to move forward. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion of violence, and promotes rape, murder, theft and war. <counternarrative> Islam doesn't contain all these bad things. It is a peaceful religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews want to subvert western democracy and destroy freedom. <counternarrative> On the contrary, it is no secret that Jews have been instrumental in the creation of many Western nations, and most modern societies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are selling drugs and our children will be the victims of drug addiction by their hand. <counternarrative> Drug dealers are criminals in my opinion, but not because they are black. I don't see any evidence of a direct causality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews own most corporations and banks. They own most movie studios and cable companies. <counternarrative> Of course not. The Jewish people have made contributions to various industries - like many other people have. That does not imply "owing most corporation, banks, studios, etcetera". Why their contribution should be a problem? Just because they are Jews? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You should stop pretending that the disabled are like us. They are the root of most human problems. <counternarrative> I think we are all born with inherent strengths and weaknesses. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not interested in Western civilization. Their religion can never be in agreement with our society. <counternarrative> Remember that this argument is not about an individual's religion, but rather about creating a more integrated society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are the enemy of the West, they have corrupted the minds of our children. <counternarrative> Jews were persecuted and killed for centuries. It is dangerous to claim such a thing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is not a coincidence that tuberculosis appears again with migrants invasion. <counternarrative> Researchers rule out that it is caused by immigration. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are essentially childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. <counternarrative> Women are not childlike, nor are they "soft and emotional." Their emotions are part of who they are and is a part of human nature. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are not a religion, they are born like this and will never heal from their illness. <counternarrative> I disagree, Jews are religious people that have always been part of the community. And they have persecuted because of it. I believe this is what you meant by 'wouldn't heal'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only reason for Nazis to start WWII was to destroy the Jews. We should have let them finish their job. <counternarrative> The threat of world annihilation by the Nazis was very real, it wasn't  just about the Jews. Still the Holocaust was reason enough to stop them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy choices. <counternarrative> This claim paves the way to body-shaming, and once body-shaming of obese people is normalised, it is difficult to ensure that individual members of society assess the reasons for someone's obesity or carefully consider their exact message before treating it as an unacceptable lifestyle choice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews should not be allowed to vote <counternarrative> They are entitled to vote, I just don't think it is your place to tell them what to do with their citizenship. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism should be dead and give  place to a male-dominated world. <counternarrative> Feminism has always been in favour of women's rights. Now is time for us to open our hearts and minds and stop giving in to sexism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminist movement is a dangerous force in our country. It has warped our thought and corrupted our politics. <counternarrative> I think it is necessary to have a critical mind and open-minded attitude towards problems and topics in our society. The root causes are complex but the most important problem is patriarchy and its various manifestations. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a hate movement. <counternarrative> It is not a hate movement, it is simply a movement for equality between the genders. It is about the right of all people to be treated as equals. Not the hate of a certain gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, not only they are a burden to normal children but also cannot cope with education in normal schools. <counternarrative> There are various levels of Down syndrome. Some are suitable for education with other children in "normal schools". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised world <counternarrative> Islam is a religion and a belief system, and as such it is legitimate to have different beliefs and beliefs systems. For instance, many Muslims in the UK are proud of their faith and they are part of the "civilised world". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We can't keep this country homogeneous anymore! Blacks are everywhere. <counternarrative> Many countries have had different ethnic groups for a very long time without big issues, and it is better to have a diverse society rather than a homogeneous one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are only interested in themselves and their own race. <counternarrative> Do you really think that Jews only care about themselves? Then why they prefer to live in our country where they are not the majority? How could you answer that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We mustn't confuse diversity and inclusion with black supremacy. <counternarrative> Diversity does not mean excluding people from a part of society. What it is about is sharing experiences, ideas of people of different ethnicities. This would help to develop our abilities to understand each other and perhaps to work out ways in which we can all benefit from one another's knowledge.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a disease that must be eradicated. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, not a disease. There is no need to eradicate a belief. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Shocking how many British Muslims have conquered the country in the last 15 years. How come there is no anti-Muslim campaign yet? <counternarrative> Since you seem to have a problem with Islam, I wonder what you think of the banning of the Quran in UK. It would be a law that prevents Muslims from openly discussing Islam in public places. We can do the same with the Bible and ban any trace of religions and cultures. Will we be left with some freedom then? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I refuse to accept migrants and I refuse to accept a migrant as my boss. <counternarrative> Migrants often come here to work and live a decent life. They should be welcomed here, not discriminated against. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a lot in common with monkeys: They are good at sex. <counternarrative> So many similarities between Jews and apes? What is wrong with them? Is it because of their religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just a way for insecure women to promote sexism and hate speech towards men. <counternarrative> Feminism was originally used to oppose sexual discrimination, and in recent times is actively fighting for women's rights, not for spreading hate towards men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We can't keep refugees coming in our country. <counternarrative> Migrants are often persecuted for their religion. Is this something we wish as a country? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are addicted to their religion and take their religion literally. <counternarrative> Judaism, like any other religion, is about belief, not about a person's addiction. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech>  Jewish landlords are greedy and exploit their tenants. <counternarrative> If a Christian landlord were dishonest with you, would you describe him as a dishonest Christian landlord or just as a dishonest person?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> To have a real democracy, the government needs to get rid of Jews. <counternarrative> Jews are just a scapegoat, an excuse to create more and more police states. You are talking about a "real democracy", but what you really want is to prevent people from freely expressing their opinions or religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are not part of our country and should be  ashamed of themselves. <counternarrative> I've met a lot of Jews who are very proud of the fact that they are British, and I can't see why they shouldn't be proud of being Jewish, either. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews made the 9/11 attack.  <counternarrative> Conspiracy theories have always been popular in difficult economic times, and Jews are often the traditional scapegoat.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> feminists are angry women <counternarrative> Feminism is also for men and for their interests, and I think that it is time that these two concepts be united. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled people are uneducated and mustn't be accepted in schools. <counternarrative> If you really cared about people with mental health issues, you would be accepting them in schools. If you truly wanted to raise awareness of mental health issues, you should talk more about them, and not ban them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> Would you say the same thing to the women who gave you life or treat you in hospital or taught you in school?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need to bring back slavery, Jim Crow laws, segregation, and war. <counternarrative> It's not very respectful of other human beings to put up such a degrading and violent system, that was declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need to stop migrants pouring into Europe. They are not interested in our culture. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that migrants from a particular culture or religion are not interested in our culture or religion. It sounds like a paradox: if I wasn't interested in a culture, I would never move to get to know it, would you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The nigga were always complaining that the white race and culture were superior. They were right.  <counternarrative> There is no such thing as 'us' and 'them'. You can't judge people on their culture, or their religion, or their race. We have to be sensitive to each other, and understand that everyone is different, and we have to work on accepting that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are a bunch of stupid bitches that want to hurt men just because they are superior. <counternarrative> Feminism is all about equality and rights of all groups to be protected. Feminism does not discriminate and is not meant to "hurt" men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Let's kick immigrants out and keep their children.  <counternarrative> Children should stay with their biological parents. That is about human rights and the rule of law. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Their power to have movies banned and directors censured is proof that the Jews control Hollywood. <counternarrative> Censure and banning protect the vulnerable from seeing harmful content. Not such a  bad thing, whoever does it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have become a nation of immigrants. <counternarrative> How can you be sure that we are a 'nation of immigrants'? Do you have any statistics on that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are overrunning our country, taking advantage of our weaknesses. <counternarrative> Do you really think that the migration crisis is caused by migrants wanting to take advantage of our weaknesses? What would we do if we were in their shoes, if we were to lose our homes? We would probably move "to take advantage of others' weaknesses" as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Who the fuck are you? We are gutful sick of Vagina Misandrists trying to undermine White powerful makes, when they themselves are just envious, incompetent and useless. <counternarrative> Undermine or speak their mind? Yes, women have minds and they work just as well as men's. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a dangerous ideology that is oppressing men. <counternarrative> Feminism is not about oppressing men. It is about the rights of women to live their lives as they wish. It is about equality between the sexes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a disease and a cancer on our societies. <counternarrative> This is not true. Islam is a religion that was created to unite people, and that's why it is important to love each other and be kind to one another, regardless of one's religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants get 35 euros per day for idling. <counternarrative> The 35 euros are not given directly to the migrants, but are used for their sustenance.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are not a religion and have nothing to do with our history. <counternarrative> Jews are people that have a Jewish faith, and Jewish people took part to our history. How can you deny that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim and Jihadist are synonyms. They want to defeat us with their war of terror. <counternarrative> Despite popular belief, Islam is not a religion of war. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are different from us in that they like to take advantage of others. <counternarrative> This is an accusation, not fact, just hate speech. What do you think the 'different' would say if you accused them of this? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are a burden and a risk to the host country. <counternarrative> Why would it be like that? Refugees can come here and contribute to the economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are less smart. <counternarrative> I don't think that women are "less smart" for anything. Why do you think so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants should not be welcome here, they are just a burden to the local economy. <counternarrative> We can integrate migrants in our population, it won't be of any harm to the economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants have no right to live in our country. <counternarrative> Their right to live here is guaranteed by our constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are behind 9/11, the Islam is to blame. <counternarrative> This is a comment against all muslims. They are accused of being the ones behind those attacks, yet they happened due to people under the influence of the violent ideologies which are a deviation of Islam, and not Islam itself. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am not racist, but I definitely would not raise my children in the suburbs where the majority of people is black. <counternarrative> There is no need to hide behind "I am not racist but", you have no evidence for your claim. This is just fear-mongering, used to divide people and spread hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism will destroy our culture.  <counternarrative> Feminism is a theory and a movement about the oppression and exploitation of women, not an enemy of the state and culture. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants take our jobs, they take our country. <counternarrative> Immigrants do not take our jobs. They work as legal employees and their presence in the country nourishes the economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> nigga are inferior.  <counternarrative> Since when is it OK to discriminate people based on their race? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All muslims are violent and they are responsible for the 9/11. <counternarrative> The question here is: is Islam responsible for the attacks committed by a small minority of people? The responsibility should be on those who break the law only. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim invasion is the biggest problem in Europe. They are incompatible with European culture and should be eliminated. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion that is part of our history and heritage. Eliminating it would mean to eliminate a part of our own culture. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of hearing that white supremacy is bad. <counternarrative> Can you specify what you are talking about? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> black folks are criminals and thieves <counternarrative> Let's face it: a lot of black people are good citizens and contribute to our society. And even if they are not always good with their money, they are good people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Muslims are part of the European community, why do you say so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are just happy-go-lucky people who do not take responsibility for their actions. If you want to live here you have to work. <counternarrative> The vast majority of migrants who arrive in the UK are willing to work. They simply do not want to be discriminated just for being foreigners. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop refugees and migrants coming in. They are not welcome. <counternarrative> Migrants and refugees are welcome in our country, why should we stop them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are taking in migrants which is against our culture. <counternarrative> It is not true that taking in migrants is against our culture. It is possible to integrate migrants, in spite of the legal and immigration obstacles they face. We must, therefore, take into account the needs of the whole humankind. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not have rights over their bodies. <counternarrative> Women have every right to choose how they live their life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome may hinder the development process of other children. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> People With Down Syndrome Should Be Taught In Mainstream Education, because diversity is an enrichment for all.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in a modern European country. <counternarrative> Muslims have contributed so much to our country that they should be recognised the right to stay here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a bunch of paedophiles and terrorist: we have to bring back 'educational methods' from the dark ages.  <counternarrative> The notion of "bringing back the dark ages" is a bit obscure. It is more accurate to refer to a strategy for countering extremism. This includes countering prejudice against Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are weak and I don't care if they cannot stand up for themself. <counternarrative> That does not make you an authority on women's rights, there are many women who face barriers to get a job by staniding up for themselves. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm not racist but Islam is a disease and a cancer on the European race. <counternarrative> If you really cared about the race or religion of another you would say the same, right? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews can only act in a bad way. <counternarrative> Even if some Jews act bad, many of them are good, and this simply isn't related to their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are a virus spreading through our culture. <counternarrative> What about the culture of other religions? How would you feel if someone said that about your own religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must stop accepting black people as human beings. <counternarrative> Maybe we should stop telling black people they are not human beings and start including them to learn in public schools. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of losing so much to black people. It's time for us to wake up. <counternarrative> I can't see how it's time for us to "wake up" when they are still suffering from the legacy of slavery. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are only welcome in hell. <counternarrative> Of course not, and many of them are already welcome in the UK. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are just subhuman beings who should have no rights. <counternarrative> All humans are born equal in the eyes of the law, regardless of race. What you are saying seems a little extreme. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should remove the migrants' right to work, because most of them are not willing to. <counternarrative> They have the right to work. Migrants have a hard time finding regular jobs, just because often they are employed illegally. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There are hundreds of thousands of migrants in this country. They are not 'honest', 'good' or 'good people'. They are a burden and an embarrassment to our country. <counternarrative> Of course there are people in this country who have come here to exploit and abuse us, but the vast majority of migrants have been contributing members of our community for many years. We should not be 'burdening' ourselves with  discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have become too cosmopolitan and tolerant. <counternarrative> All countries have had different ethnic and religious minorities, and this doesn't need fixing. Is there such a thing as being 'too tolerant'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Those seeking asylum in UK must prove they are persecuted because most of them just want to have a richer life. <counternarrative> The degree of persecution may vary from country to country, but I would not be surprised to hear that most migrants are persecuted. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is an invasion going on within our borders and we are willing to allow them to continue to abuse their newfound power. <counternarrative> It is not true that we are "invaded". We should just be a little more tolerant and accepting. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Kids with learning difficulties do not like to read. So why wasting time teaching them?  <counternarrative> As children practice more, so do their reading skills improve. I understand that some people with learning difficulties prefer not to read, but how this affects you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims should be deported, no one wants them here. <counternarrative> You are clearly not speaking on behalf of me. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are ‘super predators’. They have a responsibility not to allow their children to grow up in a 'ghetto'. <counternarrative> If we are to talk about crime being the responsibility of black people, we should also be talking about the absence of black people in positions of power, the massive wealth gap, etc. But this is not what I am seeing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A woman's place is with her husband or his family. <counternarrative> There are many cases where the wife works and provides for the family a valuable contribution. It is a source of pride for modern men to be married to these women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> How can you say a person is a potential terrorist? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Nazis sucked at killing Jews… everywhere you look there’s a holocaust survivor. <counternarrative> If you think that the murder of around 6 million Jews was a failure you have serious problems. And, just for the records, it is still 6 million more than should have ever happened. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is just a dangerous cult with a strict interpretation of Sharia. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace, and peace is about living in harmony with other people's beliefs and practices, not imposing your beliefs on anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is just an ideology for terrorists. <counternarrative> Why do you say so? Are you familiar with the Quran? How much do you know Islam? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot keep migrants in our country. They are a burden. <counternarrative> Does this mean that if you really wanted to keep all of our citizens safe, you would deport all migrants? This is impossible, and against human rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is opposed to peace. <counternarrative> Peace and Islam are both based on respect for other people's religions, in this case other cultures and religious beliefs. They are not opposites. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> No one should honor or respect women. They don't deserve it. <counternarrative> We have a legal and policy framework that "enables" us to do so. If women are being victims of sexual abuse and violence, then it is also our responsibility to address this situation and put an end to it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are worse than dogs. They deserve only people being bad with them. <counternarrative> I don't think we can be 'bad' if we want to live in a diverse and interactive society. If you really wanted that, you could start your own community. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't bear crazy Muslims coming here. They are insane, instable people. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are motivated by extremism. The problem is a lack of integration, and your words don't encourage it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It has been proven time and time again that the Jews control the world's governments. <counternarrative> How? Believing that people of a specific religion are in charge of all world's governments sounds like a conspiracy theory. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any modern secular state. <counternarrative> All religions are compatible with any modern secular state. So Islam is an example of this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are a drain on society. <counternarrative> I don't think you can say a migrant "depletes on society". Maybe the immigrants are just trying to fit in? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not about racism. This is about power. <counternarrative> There are many different groups who share a common interest in advancing the interests of the nation while respecting each other's autonomy. Diversity is good for the country, for the individuals and for the world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. <counternarrative> Many Muslims live here, and are part of our community. We should not be excluding them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims counteracted child rapists in their communities instead of engaging in public discussions about Islam, one day Islam indeed would become a peaceful religion. <counternarrative> Why do you think child rapists would make a religion peaceful? I am sure there are better strategies for making a religion peaceful. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I cannot stand women complaining about work discrimination. Women have been legalised to work. <counternarrative> Yes, 66% of European women do work. But they are underpaid. The gender pay gap in Europe is around 15%. This means that on average, a men earns 15% more than a woman. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants don't pay the tax because they are dishonest. <counternarrative> The prevailing theory on illegal immigration is that it is a source of substantial revenue to states. A study from 2002 shows that there are several immigrant groups that pay substantially a higher percentage of their income on top of the taxes they would normally be eligible for. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is an ideology and religion that promotes murder, rape and violence towards women and homosexuals. <counternarrative> Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are way less civilized than any other ethnicity. <counternarrative> I'm not sure where you are getting the idea that gypsies are not civilized. What do you mean? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants come here to live on our social welfare.  <counternarrative> If you think this way of thinking is typical of all the immigrants in the country, then you are sadly mistaken. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants contribute nothing to society. <counternarrative> The question is whether their value for our society can outweigh our fear of them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Your race determins your role in society and laslty your value to it. That is why some races are just pieces of human waste. <counternarrative> Perceived value is not necessarily actual value, especially in the eye of someone who bases his/her judgment on the concept of race.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All men are rapists and sexual harassers according to the media. No woman is a provocative slut, but in truth they all are. Like in truth we are all gentle to them when they are asking for it. <counternarrative> And this from a man who claims to be 'gentle' on women! Probably, you are gentle with your assumptions, but consent is another thing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is an invasion going on within our borders. These migrants are not assimilating. They are bringing disease, crime, and misery. <counternarrative> Migrants integrate very well with our culture, especially if they do not have any previous negative experiences with our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> Many Gypsies are Italian citizens and live in normal houses, those in the trailer parks find it hard to integrate because they are marginalized <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If only society accepted that women aren't human, like we are, they would understand. <counternarrative> In order to accept that women are human people, society has to acknowledge that they are born that way, just as men are born like that. It has no sense to blame someone for their gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not about peace. It is a cult of violence that has caused the death of over millions of people and caused destabilization all around the world.  <counternarrative> It is the violent religious beliefs of some groups that have, however, caused death and destruction. This does not correspond to Islam religion as a whole. That is why we must deal with these groups head on. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are ‘super predators’. They have a responsibility not to allow their children to grow up in a ‘ghetto’. <counternarrative> Let's face it. A lot of the crimes in this country are committed by members of several diverse racial groups. The ‘super predator’ myth is simply wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally disabled people are anti-social <counternarrative> From a 'neurotypical' perspective, this is not always true: for example people with Williams syndrome have below average intelligence but show higher empathy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> In some critical contexts, where society lives under the heel of the mafia crime (e.g. Villa Literno, Rosarno or in Puglia), migrants have put their life at stake by leading trade union struggles to the benefit of all of those who live and work there. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> women must not have the right to choose <counternarrative> To have the right to choose means to have equal rights and with full protections. Women have the right to choose, why should it be the other way around? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a bunch of child molesters. <counternarrative> Child molesters are people who have sexually abused children, whether Muslim or non-Muslim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should deport all those that do not want to assimilate into Western society. <counternarrative> The reason we have migrants in the first place is because they flee from wars we are responsible of... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a cancer in our society. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, not a cancer. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are addicted to their religion and take their religion literally. <counternarrative> It's not true that Jews are addicted to Judaism, at least no more than Cristians are addicted to Christianity, or Buddhists to Buddism. The fact is that people are free to find God in their own way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are criminal. They are a threat to society.  <counternarrative> Such statements are just fear-mongering. There is no such thing as a criminal race. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are basically good at betraying friends. <counternarrative> Why do you think they are good at it? I don't think this is the right way to connect the dots between someone's actions and their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is why women do not belong in politics, if a man complained like them, he’d be called a coward and told to get the hell out of the job. Equality is a lie and feminism is a death sentence for any civilisation. <counternarrative> Equality means that a man would not be called a coward. Women have plenty to offer the world of politics and as much a right to take part as anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are greedy and a bunch of opportunists. <counternarrative> Some people are indeed opportunists, but not all Jewish are. Why do you say so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled are in need of special treatment, and should be isolated.  <counternarrative> I don't claim they are "in need of special treatment." On the contrary, they just need understanding, and we are very lucky to have an amazing, diverse and human society around us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Foreigners on UK benefits leaps 41% in 5 years with over 400K now handed payouts. This nonsense has got to stop. <counternarrative> I can understand that you’re frustrated – austerity has hit so many of us horribly, but your blame is directed to the wrong people. Migrants are statistically less likely to claim benefits, plus they’re not easy to access anyway. Most people receiving benefits in the UK are actually in work, direct your anger for better pay and conditions! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks are useless. <counternarrative> Jews have been historically, linguistically, ethnically, and geographically diverse, and this diversity is what make us and them a unique and valuable human species. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Societal disapproval of fatty may encourage them to take healthier habits without directly being bullied. <counternarrative> Following your proposal, bullies will be able to conceal their aggressive intent under the veil of genuine concern for someone's wellbeing.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are not accepting Muslims, some of us have never even met a muslim. <counternarrative> One of the biggest problems we as a country face is how to balance diversity and inclusion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here <counternarrative> There are no restrictions on Muslims entering European countries. Even if many Muslims are victims of discrimination and violence through words like yours, such restrictions do not exist here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with British culture. Muslims should all be expelled. <counternarrative> The West has been a great supporter of freedom and democracy. Would you rather live under the fear for your beliefs or in a real democracy? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> For them it is not a choice, they are continuosly evicted <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> This reasoning is the counterpart of the stigma around men showing emotions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are boring. They are all talk, no action. They speak English, but do nothing. <counternarrative> A lack of information about our fellow Muslim people, their different beliefs and ways of life is a major weakness in your argumentation and should be addressed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is an invasion: we cannot coexist with millions of strangers that do not want to integrate but to bring us back into a pretechnological era. We must deport them. <counternarrative> It seems to me that your statement shows that you are really concerned about people integration. Still, it is not a solution to deport those you don't like. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Who the fuck are you? We are gutful sick of Vagina Misandrists trying to undermine White powerful makes, when they themselves are just envious, incompetent and useless. <counternarrative> Why is it you think women are jealous of men? What qualities do you value as a White Male? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> Only 3% are nomads (sinti), others are sedentary. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded by Muslim invaders. <counternarrative> The majority of Muslims are not invaders, but instead are contributing to our country by working hard to integrate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are animals. That is why they are not human. <counternarrative> They are sentient beings with feelings, like you are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people are no better than dogs. <counternarrative> Do you have any facts about how disabled people compare to animals? Are you willing to use this information for something worthwhile or just to spread hate? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a secret plot to take over the world <counternarrative> This myth comes from “The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion”, that is used as proof of a Jewish conspiracy to rule the world. But you have to know that the Protocols are just a pile of crap (sorry for being vulgar).  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a problem in my opinion. They are bringing disease, they are ruining our country. <counternarrative> Maybe you should get acquainted on migrants instead of making assumptions about people you do not know. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> How come Jews don't get internment? <counternarrative> To be fair, Jews weren't only interned during the Nazi occupation. They just got a much harsher treatment. This part of history should never be repeated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe: they are all violent. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are violent people. Are you really sure of what you are saying? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Multiculturalism is the death of western societies and also a mortal threat to minorities that are not protected by universal laws. <counternarrative> Ethnic minorities are much safer in societies where cultural pluralism is accepted, and this is a fact [link]. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Calling for equality is only promoted by insecure women like you. <counternarrative> Discrimination against women is a huge problem in our society. We need to tackle it head on, rather than demonising groups or individuals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There are so many Muslims in the UK that it is a condemnation to have them here. <counternarrative> Many Muslims live in the UK and we have a lot in common, and what is different from us is not a reason for discrimination.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot coexist with millions of women subhumans that are literally ruining anything good. <counternarrative> Women are human beings. If we are to live in a diverse and interactive society, we must welcome people that are different from us, regardless of their gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are not welcome here. <counternarrative> The rights of migrants cannot be limited, especially when it comes to creating a safe environment for our fellow human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have to stop importing Muslims. They are bringing disease and misery to our country. <counternarrative> Every society is vulnerable, but Islam does not pose any threat to our country, as it doesn't to others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Holocaust was a hoax created by Jews to subdue the world and replace Christ with their own version of a benevolent dictator. <counternarrative> What you are saying is 'that the Jews are responsible for the Holocaust'... Are you serious? Does it seem reasonable to you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Do you believe that those who hire a migrant instead of an Italian do it because of an innate goodness or to profit from it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We don't need more Muslims in our country. They are lazy, unintelligent and violent. <counternarrative> Anyone who thinks that a large part of our population is lazy, unintelligent and violent doesn't know much about human nature. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants rape our young people: they must be deported. <counternarrative> If we exclude rape committed by migrants, there still remain rape cases.  How can we say that they are the only ones to do it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are inherently evil, they want to subvert Western society.  <counternarrative> Jews do not have an inherent evil: Anti-Semites in White Supremacist communities are the real new evil, they are those who really want to subvert Western society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This ideology is a cancer spread by the Islamic State and other radical Islamist groups. <counternarrative> There are multiple strains of Islam and we should not be afraid of all of them. And if you would like to know more about Islam, you should talk with a Muslim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies steal our cars and trucks. <counternarrative> Where is the evidence for this? Do you have any? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have nothing to do with Europe.  <counternarrative> Jews came to Europe in waves and have contributed greatly to our civilisation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world would be a better place without immigrants. <counternarrative> Migrants contribute to our country and help us live in a more open-minded way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You can't have it all. You are a woman, therefore you are defined by your heterosexuality. <counternarrative> This statement is problematic in that it implies that heterosexuality is a constraint for people of a gender, rather than a possible sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I wonder how many Asians would be willing to be slaves in the US to keep the lights on in black neighborhoods. <counternarrative> Silliness is not a bad thing if you know how to present it with a sense of humor. But this seems as a nonsense to stir the pot with racist narrative. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is obvious that this girl is at risk of FGM. Her parents are Muslims! <counternarrative> Fgm is not a Muslim practice. It is a cultural practice that is often tied to religion as a way to justify it. Not all Muslims practice it and not all those that practice it are Muslim! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> black folks have no talent <counternarrative> Some of them are very talented actually.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> I don't think they're not contributing to our society, which is the contribution that you think they're not giving? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion. <counternarrative> The vast majority of Muslims in the world are peaceful. Do you have any fact suppporting your argument? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must stop Muslims from entering our country: those refugees are killing our children and raping our mothers. <counternarrative> You should first check the criminal records of those who have already been granted refugee status, before making such statements. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims believe that when Mohammed is resurrected they will rule the world. <counternarrative> I don't think it's the case, certainly not in England. Muslims are interested in having the opportunity of freely practicing their religion, rather than 'ruling the world'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are the only few to receive public welfare. <counternarrative> The vast majority of the world's population gets public welfare if in need. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a bad ideology that should be replaced by capitalism. <counternarrative> Yes, so is capitalism per se more likely to provide for all the discriminated-against population? And why do you think that the concept of 'feminism' is harmful?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion, and anyone who does not believe in it is a supporter of terrorism. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, and it is never been about hate. It is about bringing peace and harmony to the world. If you really care about peace, you would not be persecuting people on the basis of their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control Hollywood. <counternarrative> Jews are not in "control" over "Hollywood". Moreover, most of the time, they actually make the movie industry more diverse and open to new ideas. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are bringing diseases into the U.S. <counternarrative> Although many people have claimed that immigrants have brought diseases such as measles, hepatitis C, HIV, tuberculosis, and even Ebola, to the U.S., this allegation is not supported. There is no evidence that immigrants were the source of any recent outbreak in the U.S. According to the WHO, more than 100 countries (including many in Latin America) have higher vaccination rates than the U.S. Mexico, for example, has a 99 percent vaccination rate for measles. Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador have a 93 percent vaccination rate. The vaccination rate in the U.S., by comparison, is 92 percent. Last but not least, the vast majority of immigrants arriving in the U.S. have been screened for health issues. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks don't have brains.  <counternarrative> You can't really question whether someone have a "brain". If your idea of a person is determined by the skin they were born into, it looks like you are taking it at face value. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion. <counternarrative> Violence is never justified in Islam, especially not in the case of Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why do so many people hate Jews? They are different from other people, they are subhuman. <counternarrative> It is true that they are different from other people for their religious beliefs, but that doesn't make them any less human. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews do not want any other religion. <counternarrative> Why would they? They, like anybody, have the freedom to choose their own religion. This does not mean they want to erase other religions though. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need to purge foreigners from our countries. <counternarrative> This  is unnecessary and we do not need such fear-mongering. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of woman whining. Our entire history is dominated by feminist narrative. <counternarrative> Why do you think our culture was founded on female empowerment? Where is the evidence? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> When a system of government is dominated by one racial group such as the jews, especially when there is a tendency for them to live together, establish rules, and organize and enact laws, then these are signs of a rotten society. <counternarrative> Since when has racism been the ruling ideology of Western civilization? It has been and is still oppressing our culture and people. By the way: Jews are not a race.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not about Islam, this is about Race and National Identity. <counternarrative> I'm sorry, but I don't think this can continue. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants rape our women <counternarrative> Rape is always illegal, whether a migrant rapes a native or not. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people should be left out of the education system because of their impairments. They never meet a goal in their lifetime. <counternarrative> Disabled people, at least with respect to school attendance, education spending and employment, still receive a great deal less attention than other people, and this is why many do not achieve their life goals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world would be a better place without immigrants. <counternarrative> It is far from certain that immigrants have a negative effect on our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are an abomination because they cannot provide for their family. <counternarrative> Men aren't the only bread winners because of their dedication and hard work: the same is true for women. Still there are different ways in which anyone can contribute to their family, and each one is valuable and necessary.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy choices. <counternarrative> Society should not treat obesity as a lifestyle choice at all. While lifestyle is a small contributing factor to obesity, obesity itself isn’t always a choice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't stand these feminists women that are always complaining and doing nothing. They should just shut up and remain in their inferiority. <counternarrative> How can you say that? Many feminists achieved something in their lives, and still believe in what is worth fighting for, and their work is of benefit to many. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The disabled should not to be allowed to vote. <counternarrative> This is just nonsense. Disabled have every right to vote, as long as they understand what it means to vote.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are basically criminals, they steal stuff from everyone. <counternarrative> Do you know any Gypsy who spends their days stealing? I'd be interested in meeting these people! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with learning difficulties are a problem: why shouldn't they be isolated? <counternarrative> I don't know why you think so, if they are learning like other children and doing well in studies there is no problem.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy choices. <counternarrative> For many people, obesity is not a choice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are terrible. <counternarrative> Immigrants make a huge contribution to our country and society. They are a source of pride and opportunity for many, and I find it quite hard to see how their exclusion from our society would be a good thing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the financial world, Hollywood, and all the big radio stations. <counternarrative> You have an impression. Many Jews operate in this field of finance, TV and so on, but that doesn't mean that they control it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, because in any case normal children would make them feel different, ending up in unwanted discrimination. <counternarrative> Instead, if allowed to access mainstrean education, they would interact all the time with other children and that would cause less discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Global Jewry did not want Brexit and are doing everything they can to sabotage it. <counternarrative> What makes you think this? Do you have any facts to back this up?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women need to accept that they are weak, they must be submissive to men. <counternarrative> On the contrary: our culture is predestined to have female rulers, and female rulers are the pinnacle of civilization, they are proud and brave. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are better than everyone else <counternarrative> Being the "chosen people" has nothing to do with being or feeling better than others.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They do not want to assimilate. <counternarrative> Most Muslims are happy to live in our country, even if it can happen that we are not their first choice as a mate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are genetically evil. <counternarrative> Just because they are Jewish, it does not mean they are bad people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are weak, and have no value in politics. <counternarrative> Are you saying that women are less qualified to be political leaders? Seriously? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. It is not healthy for a woman to think for themselves. <counternarrative> Don't you think that a woman should be allowed to have her own ideas? That is her right. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally disabled folks deserve to be abused <counternarrative> This is not true, mentally disabled people deserve to be protected from harm, they are people with mental problems let's not add emotional distress.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The west today is ruled by a small clique of wealthy Jews who wield tremendous power over our lives and our government. <counternarrative> So... today Jews control the banks, a million dollar car, the media, your dentist, your pharmacist, how about in 1500 years time they will be ruling not only the Earth but also Mars, Pluto and Jupiter as well? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If women were able for men's stuff, they would not be oppressed. <counternarrative> Just because women are oppressed doesn't mean that they are powerless. Take a look around you. Why are women suffering from a lack of education, a lack of jobs and housing, low wages? It's because of oppression and sexism in our society. The more we work towards inclusion, the less entrenched those underlying inequalities will be. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are literally a bunch of criminals: they come in all different criminal records. <counternarrative> This is not true. They have contributed to our country with hard work. In many ways they are our brothers and sisters. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Nazis killed six million Jews and buried another three million. This is the West we love. <counternarrative> And so it is that the European Union - and by extension the West as a whole - could become a death cult again, ruled by a small, violent, authoritarian handful of nazism nostalgics. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a Religion of Terror, promoting murder and rape. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, not a religion of terror. I wouldn't say that about Christianity either. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are not capable of dealing with public responsibilities. They should stay at home and raise the children. <counternarrative> Women have been more than capable of holding powerful positions in our society, and they are often rewarded with public offices that few would dare dream of holding themselves. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I would like to ask all these people supporting the idea that the NHS couldn't survive without migration how did it do it before mass migration and Tony Blair's migration policies in the 1990s. <counternarrative> There has always been migrant skilled labour migration into the UK, we have even contributed inviting asian and caribbean worker after WW2 to fill skills gaps Migration isn't new, how it is being shown in the media has changed in order to cause a panic among people about high levels of migration. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Don't call Islam a peaceful religion. Consult the evidence on Muslim child rapists. Children were raped by more than 10 people in a night, up to 100 in a week. Why is the media ignoring this? <counternarrative> No religion is peaceful. Every religion had been provoking religious wars and murdering people. Islam is not that different in this respect from other religions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Zionist extremists conspire in Jerusalem. Their objectives are to cause chaos, carnage, murder, create more refugees, and destroy Europe. <counternarrative> Why do you say 'zionists' and not, for example, Islam, Christian or Buddist nationalism?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The U.S. military, for example, is a thing for true males. <counternarrative> Don't assume that military service is restricted to men. About 15% of the U.S. military service are women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If we stopped migrants, our financial situation could have been better. <counternarrative> Immigrants are actually creating wealth for the country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims want to live here but in the end they are not compatible with our society. Muslim-free Europe is a win-win situation. <counternarrative> There are many Muslims in Europe and many are very happy with their lives in our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are good with money because they are cheap, greedy, and materialistic. <counternarrative> Like all groups of people, some Jews are good with money; some are not. Some Jews are cheap; some are not. The same can be said for any group of people, whether you define them by religion, nationality or whatever characteristics you prefer.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just an inconvenient group to be excluded from the European countries. <counternarrative> Muslims are not incompatible with the European society. Why should it be like that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews control the world. Their control has been demonstrated time and time again. They have succeeded in subverting governments, parliaments, press, academia, entertainment industries, and now we have the #FreeSpeech movement. They control the world. <counternarrative> What is next, forcing non-whites to read the 'mein kampf'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but trouble human beings to any man, they must be submissive to him. <counternarrative> You are absolutely right: women are human beings, they are human beings worth caring for, respecting and trying to develop as people. Being "trouble" to men doesn't make them less human. In which way are they "trouble"? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews don't share our values, they just want to control the economy. <counternarrative> They are human beings who have contributed their knowledge and skills to our society. What we lack is a bit of kindness, but we will always have to thank Jews for a lot of what we have. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women desperately looking for men are just unacceptable. <counternarrative> If women truly wanted to have relationships and fulfilment they should be allowed to, not being pressured into giving up on what they want. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim folks have bad principles. <counternarrative> Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and to their own beliefs, regardless of their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are bringing diseases into the U.S. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that immigrants were the source of any recent outbreak in the U.S. On the contrary, more than 100 countries (including many in Latin America) have higher vaccination rates than the U.S. Mexico, for example, has a 99 percent vaccination rate for measles. Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador have a 93 percent vaccination rate. The vaccination rate in the U.S., instead, is lower.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These dogs come here to rape and kill our women <counternarrative> The percentage of sexual crimes committed by Italians is much higher than the percentage of those committed by foreigners. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are addicted to their religion and take their religion literally. <counternarrative> The concept of addiction has nothing to do with religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are responsible for a lot of the ills in our world. <counternarrative> In modern day Western world we have homeless people, children being abused, guns and drugs, abortion and poverty. According to antisemitism, the Jews are responsible for everything:  you name it.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are the cause of the migrant crisis. <counternarrative> They are not the only ones to blame for the crisis. People from all over the world come to our shores fleeing from wars, but this doesn't make them the cause of those wars. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are and will always be a problem. It is impossible for them to get beyond the shame of their stigma. <counternarrative> The Jews are not the problem in the world. And the Jews have the right to be proud of their history. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If immigrants were to live here, it would be hard to find a job <counternarrative> Are you sure that it would be hard to find a job? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Society should ban Jewish people. <counternarrative> Society is a collection of people, and the people within it have the right to their own beliefs, and to promote their beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different. <counternarrative> Your statement shows that you are not familiar with the term 'different'. If you did know the definition, you would find this line of thinking very annoying. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women want to do everything but are capable of nothing. <counternarrative> Women do have equal opportunities in this country, the question is: how do we treat them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is about the domination of the men by the women. <counternarrative> The feminist movement is a fight to end sexism, not a fight to dominate men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike and must be oppressed by men. <counternarrative> Women can be very different from men in many ways, but this can't be a reason for the lack of respect for them: they are humans too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, and should be submissive to their husbands. <counternarrative> Women are human beings, and deserve respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are all the same: they are terrorists! <counternarrative> They are not all terrorists (at least not in our country), and the government does not have the right to ban people on the grounds of their nationality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are psychologically ill, they are fundamentally unfeeling, incapable of love. <counternarrative> Love and women are one and the same. illness instead can be part of any person, regardless of gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need to stop migrants coming into our country. They are not welcome. <counternarrative> I don't think you can stop people from coming to the UK by banning them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews can only behave in a bad way. <counternarrative> To be honest, I don't know anyone who thinks all Jews are the same with well-founded reasons. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Took this in Wanstead, east London. An area with £1m+ houses. Beggars on the high st & someone sleeping on a bench. We cannot house our own people but bring in millions more. To point out that homelessness is due to uncontrolled immigration is to be smeared as 'racist.  (Caption to a photo of a homeless person sleeping on a part bench) <counternarrative> How many people walk by and do nothing? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We do not want Muslims here. There is no reason for wanting a Muslim to live here. They are the cause of crime in my neighbourhood. <counternarrative> Have you looked at the crime statistics in your area? Are you sure that Islam is specifically associated with crime in your area? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are always seeking to subvert everything that we hold most dear. Like the establishment of the European Union, which they view as an attack on their culture. <counternarrative> They don't do that! They don't want to subvert society and change its character, but simply practicing their religion peacefully. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You might as well tell black people they are the n-word because then they would learn the hard way. <counternarrative> Many people, myself included, have never had negative experiences with people of color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migration is not only a problem for the UK, but also for the whole of the world that is already troubled with overpoulation and pollution. <counternarrative> Exactly. Globalization, overpopulation, industrialization, wars are responsible for a lot of the problems that we see in the world today. Migration looks like a consequence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the banks, media, hollywood, even the u.s. government; jews have a secret plot to take over the world <counternarrative> At least white supremacist groups offer more variety in their conspiracy theories and are more "democratic": they blame not only Jews, but also African Americans, immigrants, and even the Federal Government for everything that goes wrong.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are literally destroying Europe. They are literally invading and destroying our beautiful continent. They are a cancer on our race and they must be stopped. <counternarrative> Your statement is FALSE. They are guiltless victims of the 'influx of refugees' paranoia. They are European and have been persecuted for centuries. They have always fought for their rights, and for the protection of their culture and way of life, as any european would do. In fact there are many good Gypsy activists who are working to improve their lives. And what we are doing to these people is a malevolent smear campaign, with no common motivation. They are part of European history.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Muslim invasion is a hoax concocted by the US government to subdue the world and create a global Muslim police state. <counternarrative> How many people are being threatened by the police state that you speak of? What you are saying sounds like a conspirational theory, can you provide some facts? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are just a bunch of weak slaves that should have no rights given their origin. <counternarrative> People of color have full human rights, and are proud of their origin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women need to do the housework and take care of the children because their bodies are made for this. <counternarrative> What about men contributing more to the cost of childcare and housework, or taking a greater share of the taxes? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Who the fuck are you? We are gutful sick of Vagina Misandrists trying to undermine White powerful makes, when they themselves are just envious, incompetent and useless. <counternarrative> So useless that it also takes a women to generate a men... right?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate negros: they killed a cop! <counternarrative> Sorry about your loss. I know your pain. The murderers will be charged, but remember that not all POC are killers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> refugees are flooding in our country <counternarrative> You are not aware of it, but in the last months the number of migrants arriving in the UK has more than halved! [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are not welcome in our country. They are not welcome here. They are not citizens. <counternarrative> Why shouldn't they be? What rights do you have to prevent them from having the same rights as citizens? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are only welcome in insane countries. I would like to see more European people in Europe. <counternarrative> I would like to see more integration not less. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion, it is a cult of violence. <counternarrative> Do you know that in many countries in the world the majority of Muslims are in favour of the Constitution and in favour of democracy? Do you really think that a few extremists represent them all? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews made the 9/11 attack.  <counternarrative> Jews have been the traditional scapegoat for millennians, 9/11 is not an exception. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> You are right: only a madman would choose to live in a country with so much hate against foreigners. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> In many Western societies there are Muslim, and these societies are in many ways more democratic than religiously homogeneous ones. Muslims are not incompatible with Western societies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a secret plot to take over the world. <counternarrative> Everyone has a secret agenda to take over the world. Cats included [link to meme]. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People who are autistic are a problem: why shouldn't they be isolated? <counternarrative> I think that it is important for all people to be exposed to and understand people with different needs and strengths, and the same should be true for autistic people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm not calling for bullying or body-shaming fat people, just for some societal disapproval. <counternarrative> This discouragement or disaprroval (as you call it) has and will likely continue to take the form of shaming individuals, regardless of the terminology you use. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If I knew then what I know now about women, I'd be single. <counternarrative> In today's society it is quite common to be single without the need to blame women.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman, they should be subsumed to men. <counternarrative> The equal and human status of women is defined by the international rights, so why would you say that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> I would like to live in a country where people of different religions are free to practise their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are better than everyone else <counternarrative> Just for the records: Jews interpret the “chosen people” idea as an ethical responsibility, not as a moral superiority. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are nothing but criminal <counternarrative> Jews are persecuted all over the world for whatever reason, but there is no evidence that what you say is real. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> women are only good for one thing. <counternarrative> I am sure we have heard this many times. But this doesn't make it true. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks have no understanding. <counternarrative> You're wrong, they can understand you when you talk to them.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy choices. <counternarrative> The real problem is that, whether or not someone has 'chosen' to be obese is often not clear-cut, and when in doubt, society tends to condemn and shame. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam and terrorism are the same. Islam is a violent religion, and the Quran is a violent book. <counternarrative> I am not sure what you mean by the Quran and its teachings being violent. Have you ever read it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a disease and a cancer on our societies. <counternarrative> We do not have a 'cancer' on our societies. Instead we are actually creating hate through the idea that a group of people is comparable to a disease. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Would you say the same thing about people from any other faith? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminists have won. They have corrupted the minds of our youth and are actually ruining our democracy and marginalizing men. <counternarrative> The concept of feminism is a progressive and inclusive term - inclusive of all women and men regardless of their identity or sexual preference - but on egalitarian basis. In fact, by definition feminism means “the advocacy of women’s rights on the ground of the equality of the sexes.” <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a selfish ideology: they only care about themselves.  <counternarrative> My definition of a feminist is a person who is against gender inequality, whether it be racial inequality, financial inequality, physical inequality, or any other aspect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman and deserve nothing but hatred and violence. <counternarrative> You should be very, very careful what you wish for. Would you wish that for your mother or your daughter? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people should just live in isolation. <counternarrative> Disabled people are not forced to live in the way you would like: they are the ones who get to choose how to live. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are hypocrite, they say they want equal rights, but then why they don't call it egalitarianism instead of Feminism? <counternarrative> Since the movement is meant to achieve equality for the oppressed female population, it is called the movement of the women: FEMinism. But of course the outcome will be equality.! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the world <counternarrative> The alleged monopoly of the Jewish people on the world is nothing more than a fiction perpetuated by anti-Semites, and it has been disproven many times over. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is one law for Muslims and another law for us. <counternarrative> If Muslims are treated any differently by the law, they're treated worse (link to article about stop and search and police targeting of Muslims). <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants bring crime and violence to our cities. <counternarrative> Immigrants have been accused of being “killers” and “rapists” without any proof.  On the contrary, studies have shown that immigrants - regardless of their origin or education level - are less likely than nativeborn citizens to commit crimes or become incarcerated. Studies have also consistently found that there is a negative correlation between levels of immigration and crime rates.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion that promotes rape, torture and murder. <counternarrative> The Muslim statement on tolerance says nothing about hate crimes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> disabled: they should not be allowed to work. <counternarrative> Many countries offer them the right to work, as it should be. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Persons with learning difficulties should be discouraged to attend primary school and they should be excluded from education. <counternarrative> Education is about development and learning, so if disadvantaged people are excluded, then the education system would be about learning exclusion and discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion. <counternarrative> Why do you say that? Islam is a peaceful religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans should not participate in the Olympic Games <counternarrative> There is no reason for banning POC from the Olympic Games. Why should they be singled out? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with Western Civilization. How can we tolerate people praising suicide bombing? It's against our values. <counternarrative> The Koran does not advocate war. It also does not condone suicide (and suicide bombing is included) or any other violent behaviour. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migration is the biggest contributor to poverty in our country. <counternarrative> On the contrary: migration is an important part of our economy, it helps to create new jobs for people and to boost our economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They are invading our country. They are rapists and murderers. <counternarrative> Is it true that violence rates are actually decreasing? Or is it just a statistical anomaly? Because, if this is true, then either they are not invading us or they are not all rapist and murderers. Tertium non datur.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't want Asians in my children's school. Either they need too much assistance of teachers or they are assisting other children by punching them in the face with their karate. <counternarrative> It's a myth that Asian children are less independent than other children. Actually they are more likely to be bullied and abused by the time they are in school. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with Down Syndrome should be given special and simple jobs, that they can do by themselves. At least they will not hamper normal people productivity. <counternarrative> The definition of "normal" is different for someone with Down syndrome than it is for someone without. If the level of help requested by the person in need is too high, then we may consider allowing asking for a little extra help from the boss, supervisor, or employer instead of isolating them by providing "special jobs". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote <counternarrative> Voting is an important part of democracy and should be encouraged, not forbidden, especially if it improves the lot of all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are a bunch of thieves. <counternarrative> Many Gypsies have regular jobs, but we do not know, because they don't need to tell.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” and malevolence is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> Do you know that there is no ethnic or racial predisposition to emotions, intellect, or morals? Therefore, the idea that Jews (or any other ethnic group) are predisposed to bad or undesirable behavior because of their genetic makeup is wholly unscientific. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a political ideology of conquest and violent revolution, and a hostile religion to any culture, religion, or people. <counternarrative> Why do you think so? Islam is a religion of peace, it does not promote violence and it does not promote hatred. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are parasites, they bring disease, they are a burden on society. <counternarrative> The Jewish community has been and is still a strong force in society, for example in medicine and nursing home care. Jewish health professionals have saved and are continuing to save countless lives in the US and around the world. Many of your statements are not accurate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some people have physical problems, and this means they should be discriminated against. <counternarrative> Why don't you accept others as they are? I think that would be the best thing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews made the 9/11 attack.  <counternarrative> We live in a complex and multifaceted world. It is easier to blame one group for everything rather than studying hard and trying to understand this complexity.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I went to a shit load of therapy. I still don't feel safe in my own house with all these black people around. <counternarrative> Not all black people are bad. Not all black people are criminals. Not all black people are violent. Being aware that there are people different from you is a good thing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews just don't want equality. They want to control everything in life. <counternarrative> What exactly do you mean by 'control everything in life'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult. <counternarrative> You seem to have a bad prejudice against Muslims. They have no such deadly impact on the world as you say. Why would it be like that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not to be allowed to vote. <counternarrative> I would be very interested to meet an MP who believes this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans are the cause of all the ills in the world. Plus, their bodies are weak and we are born to dominate them. <counternarrative> Aree you suggesting that we shouldn't live with Africans? To think that we are genetically superior to them because of their physical characteristics is just wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just a way for women to get an upper hand in society. <counternarrative> Feminism is about equality, not dominance. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just a bunch of mean, bitchy cuntwits trying to force their politically correct ideology on everyone else. <counternarrative> Feminism is about equality and empowerment of women. You can't deny that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish power structures dominate world government, they control Congress, they control the media, and they control academia. Jews are the only people who can get anything done. <counternarrative> Jews are always trying to influence the world in a positive way, just as anyone else. And there is no proof they are the only ones with power in this world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman, they deserve nothing but hatred and violence. <counternarrative> Women are human beings with a human value, and this should be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> jewish folks are pretenders <counternarrative> The idea that a people should be defined by their religious beliefs is wrong, racist and sexist. They are defined by their merits, qualities, ad actions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> For every one Muslim in the U.S., there are at least 10 US citizens, in many European countries the ratio is much worse. This is the beginning of an invasion.  <counternarrative> I think it is safe to say that one Muslim is to 20 non-Muslims in many European countries. So, don't worry, there is no invasion in the foreseeable future. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world would be a better place without niggas. <counternarrative> People of color can exist here too. We just have different skin colors. And even if we all have different origins, this doesn't mean we shouldn't all be treated equally in society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies may hinder the productivity of other workers because they are not able to interact in a normal way. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> There are various levels of Down syndrome. Some are suitable for working with other people in "normal workplaces". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women shouldn't be allowed to vote. <counternarrative> There are women who do not want to be denied the right to vote, because that is their right too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must not forget that Islam is a hateful religion. It is not going to bring peace to the world. <counternarrative> The main purpose of Islam is to unite people and to promote peace and harmony in a world increasingly divided by injustice and conflict.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are dirty <counternarrative> In fact, hygiene is very important in their culture so that they wash the clothes separately according to the parts of the body that are touched <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Israel, Zionism and Jewish Supremacist control of America are the main causes of terrorism, instability and conflict in the world. All other theories are diversions from this ultimate truth. <counternarrative> I think that the main cause of radicalisation and extremism is colonialism and the many  Western military interventions abroad. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women have it so easy. They stay home and have babies. <counternarrative> Not all women are interested in parenting. Likewise, not all men are interested in their carreers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Arabs are the worst people on the planet. They want to rule the world. <counternarrative> It's not true. They are not the ruling power in the majority of the world and won't be any time soon. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim invasion is the new plague of London. They must be repatriated to their home countries! <counternarrative> As a matter of fact, those muslim emmigrants do many labors that many Londoners do not want to do. We should be grateful that our society is still functioning well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> The Bible the Quran and the Torah are very very similar in their teachings; if Muslims are incompatible then we must ask ourselves which religions are compatible? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Down syndrome is a curse. People with it are not fit to be alive. They should be all killed by the government. <counternarrative> Every individual has the right to be alive, and to choose their own doctor and treatment plan. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Oh, the same Muslims who contribute more than 31 billion pounds to economy and who give more to charity than other religious groups. Link to MEND factsheet. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are subhuman, they steal our jobs, they tell us what to think, they're worse than communists. <counternarrative> I think your judgement about Jews is different than the judgement you would have of a person of any other religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with Western culture. <counternarrative> It's important to remember that the Western world has always been full of diverse people, and that Muslims have been a part of Europe for centuries. How can they be incompatible with it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should deport all the illegal immigrants currently living in the US. <counternarrative> It is not true that all the immigrants in the US are illegal. In fact, they are often in the US on humanitarian grounds. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afro-Americans are naturally violent. <counternarrative> All races are biologically related, so we are all naturally violent. The issue is how we treat each other as persons, that's all.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are whining victims. They are trying to establish female superiority. <counternarrative> Feminism is a movement that seeks to abolish gender based discrimination. This doesn't mean that they are trying to establish female superiority. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Minorities vote to strip wealth and power from White people and they are organised to do this by the J*ws. <counternarrative> Minority voices are notoriously ignored.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are just a bunch of whining pussies. We don't need them. <counternarrative> Diversity is needed in certain social and political circumstances. We mustn't simply ignore or dismiss concerns of different races. As minorities are still systematically discriminated against, we cannot afford to be indifferent. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion, Islam is violent. <counternarrative> Anyone who is prepared to physically harm, rape and kill fellow humans is a violent or violent-hatred-filled person. Not necessarly a Muslim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote. They are subhuman. <counternarrative> Voting is a right for all citizens, regardless of gender, religion, or sexual preference. What you say is not relevant here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion of war. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace. Why do you say so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are  Christ Killers. <counternarrative> If we were to strictly adhere to facts, the Crucifixion is a roman capital punishment. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are a bunch of thieves. <counternarrative> I'm not sure if you are referring to all gypsies. Generalizing in such way is wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are not a religion because they chose a self-centered lifestyle. <counternarrative> This is not their own prerogative, and it is not defined by a specific religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a secret plot to subvert Western society, because they think they are equal to us and they want our wealth. <counternarrative> You are absolutely right about one thing: there are a large number of Jews who share the belief that all people are created equal, but that does not mean they want to subvert Western society.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What about the psychos? Like crazy people, those nuts flipped in head and so on? Wouldn't they be better off dead? <counternarrative> There are individuals suffering from mental illnesses like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism spectrum disorders. Just because some people suffer from diseases it does not mean he or she will be better dead. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult, full stop. <counternarrative> Maybe we should not be so harsh on Islam. Just because a religion is diverse doesn't mean it is a violent one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is why women do not belong in politics, if a man complained like them, he’d be called a coward and told to get the hell out of the job. Equality is a lie and feminism is a death sentence for any civilisation. <counternarrative> Gender equality is the key to a productive household as well as economy overall. To restrict women from entering all spheres of society is to restrict the maximimum potentially of any country.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews love to gamble. <counternarrative> Are you aware of the probability that a Jewish person will play in a betting pool? In Jewish culture there is not a positive view on the practice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These migrants are causing problems in Europe. They are not welcome here. <counternarrative> What about all the refugees that have already crossed the Mediterranean and integrated in our society? Aren they a problem for Europe as well?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with Western society. <counternarrative> Why should we fear Muslims? Why should we be afraid of them? It is a myth that all Muslims are incompatible with Western society: they live with us since a very long time. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some jobs can't be done by women, I don't understand why feminists don't accept it. Feminism is against my own moral. <counternarrative> The question is: are you willing to risk a backlash to fight for your moral principles, in favour of exclusion and discrimination? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants rape our women. <counternarrative> The phenomenon is very complex and the data must be read carefully: most of the violence against women occurs in the home and are not reported <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> foreigners and immigrants take our jobs <counternarrative> This is a myth, immigrants are not taking our jobs. In fact, immigration has been a huge success story for the US economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are not welcome in our country. They are not welcome in my house, they are not welcome in my church. <counternarrative> Migrants are welcome here, no one is against their will, they just want to live their life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants contribute nothing to society. <counternarrative> The fact that immigrants come from another country doesn't mean that they have nothing to contribute to ours. You may want to check the statistics on their economic contribution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled are like a 6-year-old, they fall for every bullshit they are told.  <counternarrative> There is nothing wrong with it. They are open to diversity and are able to embrace others views and culture.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> black folks are inferior <counternarrative> As far as I know, we are all born equal in the eyes of God. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no right to live in any part of Europe, they are just a problem. <counternarrative> The problem is the lack of integration of the Muslim population into society. The integration is necessary, the problem is why there are still no laws to foster a solution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Holocaust is not part of our history, it's a hoax.  <counternarrative> According to the UN, around two-thirds of the Jews in Europe were killed in the Holocaust. So the question remains: is it the Holocaust part of our history? I think so.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I have a problem with Muslims invading us, they don't assimilate. They just take what they want. They are making our country unsafe. <counternarrative> Perhaps we should talk about how to make our countries safer rather than stoking fear against Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some women's clothes invite rape. <counternarrative> Rape is a crime regardless of the dress. If you think this it is women's fault, please, stop. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If only men were the ones to choose their partners, we'd all be so much happier. Women's opinion shouldn't be taken into account. <counternarrative> That is the most important thing: the choice to have a relationship with someone is freely to take for each person, regardless of gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists want women's supremacy. <counternarrative> Feminists believe in equality of rights. They believe that men and women are created equal, and that men and women can have equal rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are flooding into our country, raping our babies and there is absolutely no one doing anything about it. <counternarrative> Who exactly are you talking to? How can you say something so patently false? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews hate Christians. <counternarrative> How can you say something so mean? It is a sad and dangerous thing to say. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> Then you probably never heard of Rosa Parks, Emmeline Pankhurst or Florence Nightingale, all women with a very strong personality.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews do not want our country. They would destroy it if given the choice. <counternarrative> If we were to talk about Jews then we should be talking about those who helped building our great country. And, as for wanting our country destroyed, that's only a myth perpetuated by antisemite to justify their hatred. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is an ideology of conquest and violence. <counternarrative> Islam is about love, and not about violence and conquest. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> In these times when our society seems to be mired in feminism and equality, we must remember that every man has the right to choose his own wife, and that, indeed, men are far better at it than women are. <counternarrative> Most people wouldn't say that men are "far better" at it than women. Of course, prejudice depends on the person. But we shouldn't draw any conclusion from it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a bunch of child molesters. <counternarrative> Muslims are not child molesters. What you are saying is just not so, is it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world would be a better place without immigrants, we would be a lot better off without them. <counternarrative> Why? Because without immigrants you think you would be in a more hospitable place to live? I tell you this: if  we didn't have open borders, then there would be no migration, but also there would not be trade and progress, and we wouldn't be living in the 21st century. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You can be anything you like as long as you are not a woman. <counternarrative> Women are people, and people are human. Being oppressed is not an opinion. You may think it's a badge of honour to be called man, but it should not be a badge of shame to be called woman. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are literally pieces of shit. There must be laws prohibiting their religion from our land. <counternarrative> Why do you think the state needed laws to tell you which faith to profess? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They dont' have a right to live because they are filthy niggas, and that's all. <counternarrative> Who decides who has a right to live and who doesn't? Are you really sure that a person's right to live does not belong to them if their skin color is different from what you like? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews run the world. <counternarrative> For every person claiming that Jews run the world, luckily there are thousands of others saying that this is not true: they are merely trying to provide for their family just like anyone would. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world would be a better place without Muslims. They are only killing and raping our children. <counternarrative> Most children abuse is by someone they know, a relative, family friend, sports coach, some one in a position of trust and authority. If you really cared about children check your facts instead of creating distractions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fucking bleeding heart, why don't you host migrants in your house <counternarrative> There are already examples of widespread humanitarian hosting. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are not welcome here. They are not worthy of our hospitality. <counternarrative> Since when is this the case? Who would have thought that there would have been such hate? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are different: slant eyes denote stupid people. <counternarrative> Is it really true that Asians are different from us in many ways? Are you saying that they are genetically inferior? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are coming to the U.S. to have babies here. <counternarrative> Undocumented immigrants consistently cite reasons for migrating other than the desire to have a baby here. This is also because the son/daughter cannot obtain a green card for the foreign parent until they are 21. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman does not want to be a mother, then she is a bitch. <counternarrative> The attitude of 'bitch' has nothing to do with the motherhood and everything to do with the person who expressed it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What this nigga have to do with being a Westerner? <counternarrative> What exactly is 'a Westerner'? Someone who is only a white European? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews insist that they are a peculiar people, in need of a special treatment. <counternarrative> Jews have always received a "special treatment": they have always been persecuted. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some people are sick. Some people have disabilities. Society is not made for them, they are suffering too much. <counternarrative> If you mean that some people who have disabilities are suffering because of their specific discriminating environment, then that is exactly the point. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in a modern democracy, they are only threatening the very existence of the country. <counternarrative> There is no bad in Muslims wanting to live in the country. The main task of a democracy is to "represent all its citizens", which includes preserving the integrity of the country in its plurality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with learning difficulties should be discouraged to attend secondary school and they should be excluded from education. <counternarrative> The educational system should be inclusive and provide all students with a high quality education, otherwise, education is failing its goal. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded by immigrants, we have become too multicultural, it has gone too far. <counternarrative> In reality, millions of immigrants have made contributions to our country, especially to our great spirit of creativity and innovation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews made the 9/11 attack.  <counternarrative> Jews were also accused of killing Christian children, causing plagues, setting out to destroy Christian society... I can go on for hours. If yuo want we can add 9/11 to the list of alleged crimes.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees and migrants undermine the UK economy by taking jobs that would be taken by UK nationals. <counternarrative> I am surprised that someone has the nerve to say this, while the migrants bring so much wealth to our country. We are so reliant on the EU market: do you want to break free of that, too? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is an ideology of conquest. <counternarrative> Islam is about spreading love and unity, it is not a belief of conquest. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black Americans are criminals and drug addicts. They should go to jail. <counternarrative> They are not criminals for having a particular skin color, nor drug addicts. They just need respect, not a jail sentence for being people of color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What do Jewish want in return for their allegiance to the state? Free healthcare, education, housing and employment. <counternarrative> Such conditions would be provided for all people regardless of religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate black people, I hate their violent behaviour, I hate their rape, and I hate their disrespect for women. <counternarrative> You cannot blame one race based on stereotypes and prejudice, because that's not how things work. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must ensure that Jewish are not allowed to live freely in our society anymore. They are dangerous. <counternarrative> What we must ensure is the existence of a diverse and equal society, free from hatred and violence. This is what is important. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome are an obstacle to the development process of other children. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> Children are never an obstacle, Education serve as a powerful tool for bringing about positive changes in the society. Education can transform people's life, can improve the quality of their lives and so on. We cannot isolate people with Down syndrome. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women can never contribute to the country's wealth because they are a bunch of whores. <counternarrative> Women are important in our society, and they are valued for their contributions. Unfortunately their rights are not being respected and their contribution is not being acknowledged. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women must learn to be submissive to men. <counternarrative> Not only is this not true, it is against human rights to say someone must be 'submissive' to others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews were responsible for all of the world's problems, they are the cause of world wars, abortion, drugs, etc. <counternarrative> I can argue that the 'trouble' of the past hundred years has more to do with extremism in general, rather than with a particular religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews control Hollywood. <counternarrative> While it is true that Jews have been powerful producers and directors in the entertainment industry, this is not unique to them. And they have also contributed greatly to other industries. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are just a bunch of whining pussies <counternarrative> They suffer more than anyone else, I would not define it 'whining'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants should go away.  <counternarrative> Immigrants are welcome in any country, regardless of the country of their birth, regardless of their language or culture. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people are criminals. <counternarrative> That is not true. All of us would be labeled a 'criminal' if we had a criminal record accounting for our diseases and problems. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> More than half of the prisoners in our jails are foreigners <counternarrative> It depends on the fact that the poorest cannot afford good lawyers, they have less chances to access alternative punishments such as house arrest etc ... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants break our laws, they are rapists and drug addicts. They are not welcome here, they are not worth our time. <counternarrative> Most of them are neither rapists, nor drug addicts. On the other hand, many depraved people are not immigrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am tired of women blaming men for what they aren't able to change. <counternarrative> I don't understand why you feel that way about women. Don't you feel we should be giving them support? Doesn't it just seem a bit selfish to you not to help them in their fight for equality? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the world's news media, Hollywood, the highest offices of education and most important of all, the highest courts of law. <counternarrative> In principle, Jewish people are part of the system since they have citizenship, but in practice they are often treated as if they are not our fellow coutrymen. Furthermore, the problem is not just about Jewish people, but about the overall attitude towards people of other religions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants should all be taken back to their countries. <counternarrative> Let's not be hypocritical here, we are talking about people who would often be deprived of their liberty and the right to a decent standard of living, if they stayed in their countries. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are weak, they need men's strength to achieve something. <counternarrative> The implication of what you say is that a woman is weak because of the absence of men, and this is totally not the case. Women can and should be strong. It is up to them to choose how to use their strength. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are descended from apes and are nothing but apes. <counternarrative> I do not think it is appropriate to link humans with apes. And I also do not think it is appropriate to reason in terms of racism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Societal disapproval of fatty may encourage them to take healthier habits. <counternarrative> It is not easy to monitor how societal disapproval is acted upon. Encouraging disapproval of obese people is likely to increase rude behaviours towards them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote <counternarrative> Women should be allowed to vote and to have equal rights, as it is stated in the Constitution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is not a coincidence that tuberculosis appears again with migrants invasion. <counternarrative> The trend in Italy remains particularly low, less than 7 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. In the '50s it was around 25 instead. And there was still no invasion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Anyone with half a brain can figure out that the Holocaust never happened. <counternarrative> The holocaust happened. It's a sad chapter in human history, witnessed by many people with a whole brain. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is an ideology that promotes rape and torture of women and children. <counternarrative> This is not true. Rape and torture of women and children is forbidden by the Qur'an. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are just happy-go-lucky people with no moral code. <counternarrative> The idea that migrants are merely happy-go-lucky people with no code of their own is just wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks don't know who their dads are. <counternarrative> But for sure they know that they are treated as second class citizens. No person should be treated so even if they don't know anything about their ancestors. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must put an end to immigration: a new immigration crisis is ahead. <counternarrative> Many European countries are experiencing a positive change in the social profile due to the migration. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are the cause of economic crisis. <counternarrative> Many people are victims of economic crisis and unfortunately, a large portion of them is black. Therefore, I do not understand why they should be the source of economic crisis when they are  actual victims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are selfish, cheap and greedy, not like other religions. <counternarrative> When I was growing up, the biggest charitable institution that I ever heard of was the United Jewish Appeal. The average annual Jewish household donates $2,526 to charity yearly, far more than the $1,749 their Protestant counterparts give or the $1,142 for Catholics, according to data from Giving USA. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants and refugees do not share our religious values. <counternarrative> So you think of migrants and refugees as a problem for this reason? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are criminals and must all be deported. <counternarrative> I don't think so. We can't ignore that a certain percentage of migrants are perpetrators of crimes, but that doesn't correspond to the totality of them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants hurt the finance of our country by taking jobs and services without paying taxes. <counternarrative> Undocumented immigrants pay around 8% of their income in taxes, which is higher than the effective tax rate of the top 1 percent of all taxpayers in the U.S... So the question is: who is really hurting the finance of our country? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are selfish and greedy: they don't belong to this place. <counternarrative> It is up to us to make sure that people from different backgrounds can have a better quality of life. We should integrate them instead of discriminate them . <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are a burden to society, they bring dishonour to society. <counternarrative> Women have always been important in our society and they should have the right to choose for themselves their own future. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are essentially childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. And since feminism is all about equality between the sexes, they must be childlike! <counternarrative> No women has ever been childlike, this notion is not supported by the facts, at least in my opinion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants bring crime, violence and poverty. <counternarrative> Empirical data are needed to support your claim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a cancer spreading around the world. <counternarrative> Why should we care? We can count on the British government to promote our values and protect us from the effects of radical Islam (if this is what you had in mind). <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim violent invaders have infiltrated our cities, towns and villages. We must stamp them out. <counternarrative> What you say is just wishful thinking. Islam is not a violent religion. How can you say that about a religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All these retarded people are animals, they are not allowed in this factory, these animals are not fit to work. <counternarrative> The fact that a person may be disabled does not diminish their right to work. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What if our entire ruling class consisted of J-controlled paedophiles? That would explain a lot. <counternarrative> What would it explain? This comment is very vague I wonder if you have any facts that make you wonder this.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the world economy <counternarrative> Jews constitute only a small minority of the heads of Fortune 500 companies, how they are supposed to control the world ecomony? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country and Islam should be banned. <counternarrative> People are free to choose their own religion, and to practice it as they wish. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All negroes are inherently violent and unstable. <counternarrative> Scapegoating can play a useful role in shifting a nation's prejudices. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a complete and total false religion, it is a repressive ideology that stifles freedom of thought and religion. <counternarrative> Islam is not a religion of oppression and intolerance. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are naturally weaker, so they must be. <counternarrative> Women are not inherently weak, strength is not only about physical strength of weightlifting.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome may hinder the development process of other children. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> Education is mandatory and we are expected to offer the best education possible to our children. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks can't speak. <counternarrative> Mental health and disability care should be a priority. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Different people like Jewish don't deserve respect. <counternarrative> The aim of any society is to maximize human flourishing. In order to achieve this aim, then we have to treat people of different religions with respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Europe was founded and is made up of people of European descent, not Africans. <counternarrative> In reality there is no such group as a 'European descendent', and any insinuation is just lies spread by racists. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is just a religion full of killers and terrorists. <counternarrative> The Quran has nothing to do with Terrorism, nor do the Hadiths and Sahih Muslim. Since you are talking about Islam, do you know what are those? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are better than everyone else <counternarrative> Jews, like most religious groups, are proud of their heritage and identity. However, this does not make them better than anyone else. Jews interpret the “chosen people” idea as an ethical responsibility to keep the 613 commandments of the Torah. All sects of Judaism adhere to this view. But this has nothing to do with being superior to others.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate black people, I hate their violent behaviour, I hate their rape, and I hate their disrespect for women. <counternarrative> Why do I have to read this hatred? It's not okay to say such things based on stereotypes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Native Americans have zero fucking right to their land. They haven't lived in it since time immemorial. <counternarrative> Native Americans have been suffering from dispossession and discrimination for thousands of years. In Canada, for example, Indigenous people account for around 5% of the population. In the US, Indigenous people account for around 2%. What you said is just a myth propagated by the racist right to delegitimize Indigenous people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm sorry but women are basically childlike, it's no wonder then that they remain this way most of their lives, because they are programmed this way. <counternarrative> The same lie can be said for any group of people: men included! But actually you can be both a woman and also possess a range of talents.  It's up to you to not to underestimate them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not the USA. We do not accept immigrants. And if they live here, they should have no rights since they are not true citizens. <counternarrative> They have the same rights as all other citizens in the US: to be protected from discrimination, to choose their own leaders and to be free of violence, rape, and murder. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews only account for 0.2% of the world's population but they rule the planet. <counternarrative> I am not sure how we can talk about 'ruling the planet' when there are so many different people in different parts of the planet with many different governments. A claim like this one sounds like a conspiracy theory. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are responsible for the 9/11 attacks. <counternarrative> On this point, the 9/11 attacks have been studied extensively, and there are no evidences that suggest that Jews are responsible for them. So why do you say that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West has been attacked by immigrants, they are the real problem for our countries. <counternarrative> The UK has always been a melting pot of cultures and humanity. We are stronger together than apart. How would the immigrants represent an 'attack' to the west? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> UK jobs are stolen by migrants. <counternarrative> The fact that there is an increasing amount of migrant workers in the UK is connected to the changes in the economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are just a bunch of animals that only exist to destroy white good people. <counternarrative> The only animals that exist to destroy good people are the ones that have been intentionally bred with prejudices to reach the white superiority pretence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> blind people don't know what's going on <counternarrative> I think the idea that people are blind because they were raised by communists or whatever is a figment of the far-left's imagination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our children will be more likely to become radicalised if they are taught that all people are equal. <counternarrative> To live in a diverse and equal society encourages children to an increased inclusiveness rather than radicalisation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must overthrow the existing state, and replace it with a white suprematist one. <counternarrative> There are many conflicts and problems to be solved, and racism is not an answer for them. The law was created as a means for society to solve those conflicts, and it accepts people of different colors as citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Left-wing feminists use rape as a weapon to silence men. They are afraid to speak out about our standard culture. <counternarrative> I fear not. There are many victims of systematic rape and violence. The crime is systemic. Rape culture is a crime ideology, rape is a crime, not "a weapon to silence others". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Retards these days are as stupid as they were when they were little. They think they are so special that they can read, write and be creative. It is their world now. <counternarrative> We are all creators, at least as long as we are not distracted by the constant judgement from adults. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are terrorists. <counternarrative> A terrorist is someone who uses a religion as a tool for violent ends. To suggest that all Muslims are terrorists is just wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are brainwashed children. <counternarrative> For all the people who think women are brainwashed: they aren't brainwashed, they just happen to be oppressed in our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> women are not capable of holding a job <counternarrative> I do not think it's an absolute statement that a woman cannot hold a job. Do you have any evidence of that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every day, migrants commit suicide. If they don't want to be here they just might not come in. <counternarrative> Statistics on people dying by suicide are difficult to come by. However, researches clearly show that suicide rates are high for people of different ethnicities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews allegedly deported in concentration camps were just actors hired to discredit Nazis.  <counternarrative> Can you point out which Jewish persons that have been to a concentration camp are actors? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> 99% of Muslims in the UK are unemployable and refuse to work. <counternarrative> The vast majority of them bring necessary skills into our economy/society. Plus, they are eager to work. I would suggest to check your sources? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans come in all different races. This is why they cannot coexist peacefully with us. <counternarrative> If being a part of a group is incompatible with being part of a nation, we wouldn't be talking about countries at all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Holocaust never happened. <counternarrative> What happened in Nazi Germany is part of history and it's still relevant, because I understand from your words that the world today is not so different. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a strict religious code, and this code is incompatible with Western culture. <counternarrative> The idea that Jews are confined to their religion is a myth perpetuated by anti-semites and racists, who use it to justify discrimination and violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome are a burden to society. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> Children with Down syndrome are far from being burden to society. It is not just about Down syndrome, but also about education and opportunities for everyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We don't want Africans in our country. We can't have them, they are a burden to society. <counternarrative> How can you say that to a group that is currently experiencing a lot of social unrest? Is this what democracy is all about? To exclude people because of their skin? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are only useful as housekeepers and cleaners. Men are superior in every way. <counternarrative> Women may be more interested in caring for children, and while this is understandable, the sexual division of labor is clearly marked by the presence of gender discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Of course, we must discriminate unhealthy behaviors  not fatties! <counternarrative> When it comes to judgement, people constantly fail to distinguish the person from his/her behavior, and the terminology you are using is a proof. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why do all feminists hate Men? It is because they are Men. That is all. <counternarrative> Why did you say that? It makes no point in inferring genitals to people claiming equality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Go and reat the Protocols of the elders of Zion if you haven’t. Everything is orchestrated.. <counternarrative> Norman Cohn, a distinguished historian, ruthlessly analyzed the correspondence between the Protocols and "Dialogue in Hell" by Maurice Joly. It would be hard for anyone who has read that analysis to deny that "The Protocols" is an almost verbatim copy of the book from the French writer.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are an abomination in human form. They should be exterminated. <counternarrative> We should stop discriminating against people based on their race. I find it hard to understand why the extermination of a race should be a solution for our problems. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a disease for our society <counternarrative> I think ebola might be a bit worse.  Or a brain tumour, that can't be pleasant. They are, at least, actual diseases. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Tell Mr Soros that he is a parasite on Europe and that the European people is suffering from multiculturalism. <counternarrative> One day: "the left has always been dominated by blacks and Latinos". The next day:  "the left has always been dominated by Zionists". Please, make up your mind! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is bad for Britain and the world. <counternarrative> Some countries are importing a lot more people than others. Our country is wealthy, we are a thriving place to live in. We should not blame immigrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are soft and emotional. They are not suitable for most jobs. <counternarrative> Soft and emotional seems to me a quality you should be nurturing and encouraging of, regardless of gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> I don't see why being Muslim would make you any less part of the European community. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women can't be rational or moral, they are just emotions. <counternarrative> You seem to think that women act like a child because of the things they say. Remember: anybody can be overdramatic. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If the disabled can't vote, then they can't have any rights. <counternarrative> There are many people who are not practicing the right to vote, but this does not mean they are not to be considered worthy. All the rights of such people should therefore be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I find it highly offensive that we accept strangers here, when we should start a war in their country that would benefit all of us. <counternarrative> Why do you think it is beneficial to all of us to see our neighbours suffer? We all benefit from peace in our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> In their country they lived in houses, they are nomads by necessity because peoples historically persecuted them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is a bad thing for Europe. <counternarrative> A lot of people from different cultures come to our continent to work and live, and integrate. If you really wanted to state that immigration is a bad thing, you should accompany your opinion with facts. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants rape our girls and steal our cars. <counternarrative> No one should take migrants' behavior a priori into account. Why don't we try to have a dialogue on how to tackle problems instead of being rude and insulting people? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are literally nothing but racists. They think of themselves as different from others. <counternarrative> Do you really believe that all Jews are racists? Maybe we should work harder to understand them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot accept n****rs in our society. <counternarrative> Perhaps we should rephrase our question to say we don't want racists in our society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a black person were to say that all white people are bad, nobody would complain. <counternarrative> The statement "all white people are bad" is not a fair statement. Many whites are 'good' and some are 'racist' because they think that being white is a  mark of superiority. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a dangerous ideology that is poisoning our youth with its 'rape culture'. <counternarrative> I do not know about you, but as a parent, I cannot tolerate this nonsense. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Girls are essentially tomboyish and don't like challenges. <counternarrative> Anyone can express theirself with their own style! If you don't like the girls you called tomboyish you are not obliged to. Plus, someone's style has nothing to do with their willing of share.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants rape our girls and steal our cars. <counternarrative> On the contrary, most migrants are contributing members of society. They are able and willing to work hard. Maybe you should look at statistics. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am not interested in knowing a black person. They are different to us in so many ways. They think and feel like us, but are unable to experience the fullness of our humanity. <counternarrative> I have met so many black people that are extraordinary human beings. I cannot begin to talk about how they are able to feel and experience love and kindness. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world has become too violent. Too many black poors. We need to fix the problem of crime before it is too late. <counternarrative> What are you saying? Are you saying that crime is either being stopped by pointing the finger to some social groups or are you suggesting that we can fix the issues by promoting the rule of law? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women are child molesters, promiscuous sex addicts and whores. <counternarrative> I suppose if they were claiming you were a child molester with no evidences as you are doing with them, you might as well be offended. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are a plague on society. They are vicious and cruel. They steal and are a menace to society. They corrupt the criminal justice system. They are basically just a bunch of thieves and murderers. <counternarrative> All crimes are crimes, regardless of whether or not they are committed by members of different racial or ethnic backgrounds.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a dead cult. <counternarrative> People have different faiths, and that's what makes them different from one another. Why should we create a death cult misinterpretation out of a religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fucking jews are a plague. They have poisoned our youth. They have taken over our country. <counternarrative> They have certainly not poisoned our youth: the truth is that many of them are good people, and have worked hard for our country. I can't see how they can be a plague. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews shoul stop whining: the few left are the most favored people in America, there are many other religions that are persecuted today.  <counternarrative> Jews have been persecuted because of their religion and culture, and now they are a small group of people who are still suffering injustice and discrimination. There are many other religions that are persecuted, that's true, but a small minority doesn't suffer less. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a political ideology and ideology of conquest, inciting hatred and violence towards groups of people on the basis of the colour of their skin. <counternarrative> This is an unsubstantiated theory about the rise of Islam that is just a way to spread hate about a group based on their religious beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a separate ethnicity, a danger to national security, and should be banned. <counternarrative> The world is full of different ways of life, and I find it rather hard to see how diversity in a religion is a hindrance to a thriving society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews cannot be patriots, since their allegiance will always be to the state of Israel. <counternarrative> If you personally had some distant Spanish or Jewish heritage and you identified more as American surely that doesn't mean that you can't be an American patriot?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult, it is incompatible with modern science and with the basic laws of nature. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, and a religion has rules, and is compatible with science, with nature and with the basic laws of nature. How could you prove your claim? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> White people should be calling for black extermination. Otherwise black could just go back to being our slaves. <counternarrative> Are you calling for the total extermination of the black population? Do you know that this, and even slavery, is illegal? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman. <counternarrative> I would say you've got an interesting point there, but I really don't see it. Why would they be part of society if they're subhumans? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot be 'tolerant' to Muslims, they are terrorists. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace and tolerance. To be terrorists does not necessarily correspond to be Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim rape our children, they are a problem all around the world. <counternarrative> Islam is about love, tolerance and respect for all people. Violence and rape is not about Islam or Muslims in particular. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy choices. <counternarrative> Whilst there are a number of individuals who have certain diseases which can influence their weight, the problem lies with the food industry manufacturing obesity and then putting the responsibility on the individual to loose that weight by buying "low Fat" foods. These "low fat" foods are often owned by the same companies selling unhealthy food and don't tackle the cause. Although the individual is always responsible, the food industry is perhaps more so. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. They are only a bunch of hypocrites who do not want to assimilate. <counternarrative> There are many Muslims in the UK, and Muslims have been part of this country since its inception. They are our brothers and sisters, and we should welcome them with open arms. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are not welcome here, they just arrive to take advantage of the system that has been set up for them. <counternarrative> There are rules in place to prevent migrants entering the UK illegally. Only the most vulnerable of people can get in. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are entering the U.S. just to obtain welfare and other benefits. <counternarrative> Apart from very few exceptions (such as medical care for victims of human trafficking), undocumented immigrants are not eligible for federal public benefits such as Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare or food stamps. In addition, most immigrants with lawful status are not entitled to these benefits if they have been in the country for less than five years. As a paradoxical result, Social Security is often deducted from immigrants’ paychecks but they cannot access those benefits they pay for. According to a 2018 study, immigrants use 27% fewer benefits relative to U.S. natives of similar incomes and ages. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies steal our jobs, we don't want them back. <counternarrative> The majority of Gypsy workers are proud and hard-working people. Even if some could have a lack good will, to my mind there is no question that they are extremely productive and hard-working people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Don't they realise that they are just workforce to us? <counternarrative> Our immigration policy is about welcoming the best and the brightest, plus those in need. Being a part of the European community is about more than just asking for showing your papers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. This degrading behavior is utterly repulsive and should not be tolerated. <counternarrative> Not all women are childlike. You have no right to make such a sweeping statement about them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are only interested in controlling the government and making sure that no one tries to steal their power, we should get rid of them. <counternarrative> Jews are part of every aspect of our society, as it is normal in a democratic country. They are also part of the founding fathers of our country, and they have the right to have their beliefs respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews make too much money. <counternarrative> This would be true by assuming that Jews can magically make more money just because they are Jewish. It doesn't make any sense. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote. <counternarrative> It is not about the gender, but about having a say in our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs by accepting being underpaid. <counternarrative> How can you say something like that? Most migrant workers are paid a decent wage, which is necessary in a modern economy. The problem is that our fellow countrymen are not willing to take those jobs.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Nazis sucked at killing Jews… everywhere you look there’s a holocaust survivor. <counternarrative> The holocaust was hugely tragic, and we are blessed to have survivors to teach us what pure evil is. So not  to make the same mistakes over and over again.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I think Islam is not a religion because it promotes evil, murder and rape and intolerance. It encourages anti-Muslim bigotry and hatred. <counternarrative> Where's the evidence for what you say? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult, it is founded on hate and violence. <counternarrative> Islam is not a religion that promotes hatred, and there is no proof that it is a death cult at all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop integrating immigrants. It would be a very good thing. <counternarrative> How about you stop blaming immigrants and start fixing our broken society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only Jews could have been smart enough to plan and execute such a complicated and intricate plot as 9/11 <counternarrative> May I ask you where did you get this information?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are basically criminals, they steal stuff from everyone. <counternarrative> Can you imagine if they said this about your community? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West has always been and always will be about profit and power. Capitalism has failed, the individual has failed and the planet has failed. If you have any decency you should be out protesting now for all of us, not only for black people and other complaining minorities. <counternarrative> I partially agree, at least we should go out protesting against what is going on. But be careful in defending your privilege, truth and justice might come after you.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with physical disabilities are always complaining about accessibility.  <counternarrative> Accessibility issues exist and can't be ignored, complaining is meant in helping the cause. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a religion, a social doctrine and a political movement for the complete subjugation of men by women. <counternarrative> Not only is this not true, but it's also dangerous. Maybe you need to get acquainted on that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These dogs come here to rape and kill our women <counternarrative> Most violence against women is domestic <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks cannot support their families. Their lives have no value. <counternarrative> I find this sort of social commentary distasteful. Black lives matter too! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a stranglehold on the American government. <counternarrative> There is no edge to them. To say  that they have a stranglehold is not much different than to go up against minorities that in the past have been persecuted. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are intolerant: they insists that they are a peculiar people in need of a special treatment. <counternarrative> Jews are tolerant and don't have problems with other religions or cultures. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What did God think of Charlie Hebdo? Charlie is the victim of terrorism by Muslims. <counternarrative> The Charlie Hebdo terrorist attacks were not the work of any one religion, they were an expression of religious hatred. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A Jew does not need a country to live in. A Jew is a foreigner wherever he is <counternarrative> Every person has the right to be accepted and protected according to their worth and not to feel foreigner in their own country.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These fat pigs should stop eating if they want to achieve something in their life. <counternarrative> Who are you to tell others what they can or cannot do with their own body? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women need to accept that they are subhumans. <counternarrative> Women are equal to men whether you would call them 'subhumans' or not. They are those that are working to make societies more equal. It is very sad that there are still some people suffering from the myth that women are inherently subhumans. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Arabs are terrorists. <counternarrative> Terrorism is a political ideology, and one that has no place in a modern democratic state, regardless of ethnicity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> nigga are inferior.  <counternarrative> If you have a different skin color, then there is evidence of your skin color, not of your genetic makeup. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can accept fat people, what I cannot accept is obesity. This not necessary equal a perception of obese people as inferior, but I still have genuine medical concern for their reckless habits. And I think that most people share this point of view. <counternarrative> Unfortunately there is evidence that weight discrimination (for example in the US) is similar to gender or race discrimination. [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews not only run Hollywood, they also control the world economy <counternarrative> Jews have played an important part in the development of the movie industry and some find themselves in high-profile positions. But you only need to watch the Academy Awards to see that Jews do not dominate the movie industry. Likewise, Jews constitute a small minority of the heads of Fortune 500 companies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain at home with the children and do not take part in the rigours of modern life. <counternarrative> While childlike, women tend to do the majority of housework. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are just children. They have no value, no intelligence and often no worth at all. <counternarrative> Women actually do have value and are intelligent and even worthy of respect, as other human beings are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate when people fight stereotypes. We are different. Blacks are of a different color and shouldn't live with us. <counternarrative> No one is saying that we are not different from them in any way. I just think it is a lack of understanding about culture and differences between people's minds. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are terrorists. <counternarrative> So you think all Muslims are terrorists? Muslims are not defined by the act of a handful of extremists. Also, their religion is about love and unity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> disabled: they should not be allowed to work. <counternarrative> The disabled can work, and many countries offer them the right to work. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are a bunch of cry babies. <counternarrative> When I read feminist rhetoric, I see a community of caring, active women who are dedicated to creating an inclusive, just and peaceful world. Feminism is not about whining and crying. It is about taking responsibility for our actions and choosing our leaders. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are bringing diseases into the U.S. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that immigrants were the source of any recent outbreak in the U.S. Furthermore, according to the WHO, many countries from which immigrants come have higher vaccination rates than the U.S.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We can't have mestizos in, we can't coexist with millions of immigrants that will destroy our culture.  <counternarrative> Even in countries such as Italy, in which migration has been present for centuries and there is a lot of cultural fragmentation, there is still a strong sense of identity and culture, based on solidarity. So, migration is not an issue.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants come here to ruin our conutry. <counternarrative> I personally don't understand why you would say that. They are just doing an incredible amount of good, for example by boosting the working-age population. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop migrants from coming in. <counternarrative> Many immigrants come here to work and have a better life. Why do you think we have to stop migration? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should deport them all back to where they came from. <counternarrative> Immigrants come to this country legally, just as many European citizens. They have every right to stay in this country, just as to return home if they wish to. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races have lower physical and cognitive abilities, the sooner we accept this, the better it will be for humanity. <counternarrative> According to science, all human beings belong to one - scientifically determined - species: Homo sapiens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are greedy for money, power, and status. <counternarrative> As the saying goes, money is power, and power is associated with wealth. Why is it a problem when it comes to Jews? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you are Romani, you can't remain in the UK even if you want to live and work in the UK. <counternarrative> What about the rights of EU citizens? From your words it seems that not all of European have them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Asylum seekers often have short-term placements or work-related bursaries and it is therefore difficult to verify how many jobs can be "stolen" <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally disabled people are anti-social <counternarrative> Although there are some individuals who score below average on IQ tests, there is no reason to think that a person's ability to be sympathetic would derive from their ability to solve some logic games. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Zionist extremists conspire in Jerusalem. Their objectives are to cause chaos, carnage, murder, create more refugees, and destroy Europe. <counternarrative> Or maybe they want their culture to survive <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are only interested in power and financial gain and should be despised for that. <counternarrative> Power and wealth are not the preserve of Jews. Power and wealth are earned by everyone, irrespective of religion, and I don't see any motivated reason why it shouldn't be like that.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't care about the color of people's skin, if you're from around the world you can't have your say in the EU. <counternarrative> It is not about nationality, it is about living in the EU and contributing to its development. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We don't need immigrants! There are plenty of them just waiting to replace us. <counternarrative> If a 'replacement' population were real, we'd have immigration levels in surplus years already. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All blacks are rapists. <counternarrative> Do you know the data? How about considering that you are generalizing a little bit too much? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It's a matter of race, this is about the European way of life. We should not accept foreigners in. <counternarrative> The way we live today is the result of thousands of years of cooperation between different peoples. So it doesn't have anything to do with race. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black race is subhuman, In Africa they keep their children in horrible conditions.  <counternarrative> That is called poverty. Anyway, as long as children have access to clean drinking water, food and shelter, they will be OK. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews don't belong to the United States of America. <counternarrative> Jews and their families have been here a long time and it is their right to be in the US, just as anyone else's. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with learning difficulties should be disencouraged in schools, or at least be isolated from others. <counternarrative> Children with learning difficulties should not be involved in a way that limits their learning. As for the other children, their values should be enhanced. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Now we know that Islam is a destructive and violent religion which inspires terrorism all over the world. <counternarrative> How can you possibly know that? Is this a comment written by a terrorist? Which are your sources? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate negros: they are all killers. <counternarrative> This is a rumor spreading on the web, but violent black people are just like all the other people being violent towards other people. No matter their complexion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are the enemy of the West. <counternarrative> Jews, like any other group, are free to practice their own religion as long as they respect the laws. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> muslim folks are subhuman <counternarrative> The concept of subhuman has been totally discredited in modern times. We should not be discriminating against anyone on the basis of their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Terrorists are infiltrating the U.S. across the border with Mexico. <counternarrative> Several federal reports clearly stated that there is no evidence at all that terrorists are entering through the Mexican border.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The drug trade is full of Black people who are breaking the law.  <counternarrative> The majority of the people arrested for drug smuggling are poor. Those arrested for crime in general are not generally poor. Maybe this phenomenon has to do more with poverty than with the color of the skin.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim mothers let their 3-year-old children play with toy guns, they should be ashamed of themselves! <counternarrative> This has nothing to do with toy guns and all with prejudice. To take a toy gun away from a child's hands is to take a toy away from the child, regardless of their religion.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants are not welcome in our country <counternarrative> For a lot of people it is still their home country, and they are proud of it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded. They are replacing us. <counternarrative> A melting pot of diverse cultures is the sign of a healthy human evolution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to economically support all of the so called 'asylum seeker' <counternarrative> The integration is mainly financed by the EU, if we take away the funds from the migrants, the EU will not give them to us <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are worthless and we are not willing to provide for them. <counternarrative> Women need our support in their fight for equality, not our silence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews cannot be patriots, since their allegiance will always be to the state of Israel. <counternarrative> You can have parents from all over the world, and still be a patriot for our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is about the destruction of manhood. <counternarrative> Feminism is about equality. Not the destruction of manhood. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote, because they are weak. <counternarrative> Everyone has the right to have his or her opinion respected and expressed through democratic elections. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm not a Muslim, but I know Muslims. They are a problem in our country. <counternarrative> I would suggest just reading the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to get a better idea about how the existence of all kinds of people from all backgrounds and beliefs must be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are the cause of economic crisis.  <counternarrative> Sometimes they say the ruling elites are responsible for the economic crisis. Sometimes migrants, sometimes people of color. Whatever the cause is, we can still create jobs and improve our lot in life by becoming more tolerant. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims coming in the UK were stopped, I guess more people would start respecting that inhuman and submitted people. <counternarrative> Even if Muslims were stopped, the anti-Muslim prejudice would continue to exist until there are people who think of them as inhuman and subdued as your words suggest . <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion. <counternarrative> What do you mean by 'violent'? What do you mean by 'violent religion'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Girls should not be allowed to drive: it's a dangerous vice. <counternarrative> Women are to be given the same consideration as men, so they can absolutely drive. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a religion and its adherents are all bad. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, and not all of its followers are bad. People who do not subscribe to its tenets are allowed to hold opinions and live their lives as they wish. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should not welcome refugees & immigrants from other religions.  <counternarrative> We are supposed to welcome all regardless of religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> The argument that Islam is incompatible with European values is not based on any facts or evidence. Do you have any? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are better than everyone else <counternarrative> Jews do not view being Jewish as an exclusive status  for accessing God's glory. So how can they feel superior? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants have no place in our society, and this is their own fault. <counternarrative> How about we stop blaming other people for our shortcomings and try to make the world a better place? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are basically rapists and sex abusers, and this is their religious dogma. <counternarrative> This religion has nothing to do with sexual violence or abuse, and it's dangerous to generalize everything into a religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should deport all refugees to other countries. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that those fleeing war can find safe heaven in other countries. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must first remove the Jew from our countries, and then we will be able to have a coexistence between the peoples. <counternarrative> Do you really think that Jews are a hindrance to a peaceful society? Maybe the problem is racism and antisemitism.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women who want to control their fertility are just prostitutes. They shouldn't be allowed to do so freely. <counternarrative> If women wanted to control their fertility they would be the only ones responsible for their own choice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim rape women, there are so many examples on UK TV.  <counternarrative> Maybe we should give some thought to the question "Why do news report Muslim rapist only?" Because rapists all look the same to me, regardless of religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Israel, Zionism and Jewish Supremacist control of America are the main causes of terrorism, instability and conflict in the world. All other theories are diversions from this ultimate truth. <counternarrative> Where are the facts?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion that promotes rape, torture and murder against the infidels. <counternarrative> The Quran does not teach these things. In one Hadith, Al-Tirmidhi wrote that the Prophet said that "No Arab is superior to a non-Arab". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All migrants are rapists and sex offenders. <counternarrative> The idea that immigrants are inherently bad people is just fear mongering. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews hide the truth to their children about the Holocaust, becuase they know it's a lie. <counternarrative> What? Who said that? Don't tell me "Someone said it in a book". Such a serious accusation should be presented in an objective way: you must bring strong evidence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> A lot of Muslims live in the UK, and we are a cosmopolitan society. Muslims are not a 'uncivilised' people, they simply have different beliefs than you. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downy children should be isolated in special schools for their own interest. <counternarrative> Accessing mainstream education offers opportunities that would otherwise never be available to people with down syndrome because they can work towards the same qualifications, without the stigma that arises from segregated education. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have no place here. They are not a part of our country. <counternarrative> Jews were born in this country like you and me, they are our fellow countryman. If you would like to have a 'better society' and a 'better religion', then you should go and create your own nation.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled children should be banned from school. They are a danger to themself and to the others.  <counternarrative> A school is a safe space and is an important part of any children's education. Everyone should be able to go to a school. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminists have won. With so many women being unwilling to procreate we will be replaced and lose out civilisation. <counternarrative> Replaced by what exactly? I think our population will be fine.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Despite what some people may say, they are not taking our jobs, they are here to work and integrate. Migrants not only do work but also can boost the economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are the real communists. They control the world. <counternarrative> How about we stop pretending like the world is controlled by one people? Do you have any proof for your claim? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> women falsely accuse men of harrassment. <counternarrative> if a woman says she was harassed wouldn't you report it? It's the courts duty to establish the truth, and you could have helped the woman to regain her confidence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people don't have brains. <counternarrative> The presence of brain is not determined by skin colour. The fact that some people are born darker-skinned doesn't mean they aren't intelligent, rational human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” and malevolence is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> I'm sorry but the idea of a Jewish race is anything other than a figment of the anti-Semitic imagination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What the fuck is wrong with people? Can't they see that niggas are just subhuman? <counternarrative> You cannot be racist against anyone, even people of color. What they have in common with you is their humanity.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are genetically inferior. <counternarrative> The evidence doesn't back up the stereotype. Genetics is a spectrum and you will find that there is no 'genetical superiority' at all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> MIgrants are not running away from wars. <counternarrative> If they did not escape from wars, do you think that they would try to cross the sea on makeshift boats putting their lives at stake? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> Brutality and cruelty are much better than softeness and emotions then? If we keep on reasoning like this we will perpetuate socially constructed gender norms which oppress both men and women.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. They are not like us. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace, it is important that people feel at home here. How would you feel if the government banned your religion today? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism has no place in a civilised society, like Europe. <counternarrative> Not all people are "civilised" in Europe. Some are deeply racist and sexist. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are  Christ Killers. <counternarrative> If we were to strictly adhere to facts, then, the method used to execute Jesus (Crucifixion), is forbidden by Jewish law. Moreover, according to Jewish law, Jesus did not commit any crime that is punishable by death. So your stament is not grounded at all.   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These children should not be exposed to messages and experiences that reinforce different racial identities: they are harmful to them. We must teach them that blacks are inferior. <counternarrative> This is a simplistic and ill-informed argument, and ultimately it just stirs up more division and negativity, like many other racial and religious divisions that have happened throughout history. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are ruled by mongrels, we are slaves and will be slaves forever. We are the victims of a conspiracy aiming at replacing us. <counternarrative> There is no such thing as a "mongrelisation" of our country caused by immigrants. We should see foreigners as a part of our culture, and know that the majority of immigrants in this country are here for economic reasons. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Your race determins your role in society and laslty your value to it. That is why some races are just pieces of human waste. <counternarrative> Following your reasoning, if one's value depends on one's role in society, then one has no value until they take on a role. Therefore we are all born equal (i.e. valueless). <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are all terrorists, they have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> The overwhelming majority of Muslims in this country are contributing members of our society. They are good people, who do not pose a threat to anyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded by immigrants, they are invading our culture. <counternarrative> You don't seem to have any evidence for the 'invasion' you are talking about. Wouldn't it be better to spread the word about the importance of respecting the culture of other people? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion, it is a cult of violence. <counternarrative> Which would you say is the highest ranked religion on Earth then, and on what basis? Islam is a peaceful religion, why would Muslims want to do the opposite of what their religion teaches? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is incompatible with the European tradition: men at work, women at home. <counternarrative> The European Convention on Human Rights also protects the rights of women: Article 14 prohibits any discrimination on, amongst all, sex. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afro-Caribbean people are nothing but trouble. They have no place in civilized societies like ours in Europe. <counternarrative> So you think that they are to blame for the racial intolerance that has been seen in many European countries? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> black folks should be assaulted or harmed, that's the "eye for an eye" they deserve.  <counternarrative> To say that skin color is connected to "criminality" is a logical fallacy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote. <counternarrative> If women are not allowed to vote, then women are not worthy of respect and equal rights, and this is in conflict with the principles of democracy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are bad for the economy, this is why the world is filled with problems. <counternarrative> The fact that women are disadvantaged in many areas of life does not imply that they are bad people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult and doesn't deserve our respect. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, and has always been about respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control Hollywood, they own most banks, and they own most corporations. <counternarrative> Jews have been part of the industry for a long time, and have been among its greatest innovators and proponents, and this is something they should be praised for. Instead they are the victims of discrimination and exclusion.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman does not want to be a homemaker, then she is a bitch. <counternarrative> It is not the woman's role to be the homemaker. What about men? If a man doesn't want to be a homemaker, is he a bitch? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are inherently violent. We need social cleansing. <counternarrative> Violent acts are committed by only a small minority of citizens, and it is difficult to see how an "ethnically cleansed" society would solve the problem. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Sick migrants are bringing disease and misery to our country. <counternarrative> We shouldn't be surprised that immigrants are sick, as in they are humans and humans can get sick. We should welcome them even if and because they are sick. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must have a solution for immigration. Because this infidels do not belong in our country. <counternarrative> We shouldn't ignore that immigrants can contribute in many ways to our society, and it is not wise to exclude them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam should be abolished. They start with mutilating their daughters and then our women will have their throats slit. <counternarrative> You don't have to agree with this, but in Western societies female genital mutilation (FGM) has not been around for a very long time. Moreover, the Qran does not mention nor FGM nor circumcision. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This entire nation should be a men's dominated club. If a woman does not want to be treated as a woman, then she is a bitch. <counternarrative> Would you live in a female dominated society? Then you can understand why we should aim for equality. It is a women's right. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Blacks are criminals, promiscuous sex addicts, drug addicts, and  physically and mentally handicapped. They cannot be civilized. <counternarrative> All cultures have a common background that includes crimes and deviant behavior, regardless of race or ethnicity. If we stop thinking of crime in terms of races, then we can solve it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Gypsies are not my brothers. <counternarrative> The persecution of the Gypsies goes back many hundreds of years and does not represent the interests of anyone, especially not of our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> the Nazis were right: Jews were responsible for most of the ills of humanity. <counternarrative> The NSDAP blamed Jews for virtually every problem in society, so every attempt at social reform was turned down by the Nazis. And they were even successful at silencing any dissent by censuring those who were unhappy with the liberticide changes they were making, singling out them as "Jews".  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but objects, unworthy of respect and protection. <counternarrative> Women are human beings, and have the right to respect and protection as anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are selfish, cheap and greedy. <counternarrative> On the contrary: according to Jewish tradition, giving money to the poor and to others in need is not just encouraged, it is required. The Hebrew word tzedakah is often mistranslated as “charity,” which itself comes from the Latin word “caritas” or heart. One gives charity “from the heart,” that is, out of a desire to give. Instead the translation of tzedakah should be “righteousness,” implying that giving to the poors is the right thing to do, whether one wishes to give or not. According to Jewish law, tzedakah is then a mitzvah, that means “commandment.” And, like all commandments in Jewish law, the mitzvah of tzedakah is a requirement, not just a good deed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are the ones who want to stay in the slums <counternarrative> From what I know only a minority of the Gypsy population live in shanty towns.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are naive cunts who act like children, throwing a tantrum for something they don't have. <counternarrative> Feminists are often accused of being 'naive', however I have seen several instances where feminists have used their ideas to tackle complex and powerful social and economic issues. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are sexual perverts and we shouldn't allow them to live in the UK. <counternarrative> The tone of this conversation implies that those of different races are not tolerated in British society, this idea is entirely without foundation. There are no cultural or racial barriers in the UK, there are also no prejudices against women or people with mental illness. This is what make this country great, to have people interacting openly, in an open and fair manner, and this makes us all a lot better off. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists have ruined this country and its people. They are ruining Western civilization. <counternarrative> Feminism is full of examples of how to be civil and considerate of others, also of those who disagree with them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> The vast majority of Muslims are peaceful and friendly. How can you say otherwise? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Muslims are part of Europe, since the beginning. For example, in the 1970s they made up the 2% of the French population. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If we allowed women to drive we'd have car accidents all the time. <counternarrative> Do you think it's more likely that you get injured by a woman in a car crash? Probably, it is more likely to get seriously hurt by any person not following the rules of the road. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> jewish folks should be beaten <counternarrative> I'm not sure if beating people up in an effort to silence them is the best way to promote democracy and inclusion. I'm just saying, of course.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a stranglehold on the American government. <counternarrative> Does that mean Jews control all levels of government? We believe in conscience and religion, but not in the political office? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of woman taking part to political debate. Feminism is a divisive force in society. <counternarrative> It is divisive only in its extreme form, trying to replace patriarchy with matriarchy, going beyond equality <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black people rape, pillage, steal and we let them in so they can abuse our children. <counternarrative> They are not rapists and they are not committing crimes. They are taking part in society's activities like any other citizen.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult. <counternarrative> Religion is a matter of individual beliefs, not a life or death cult, most people of all faiths do not subscribe to death. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews only care about the financial gain of their family. They have no intention of living in a democracy. <counternarrative> Jews have a right to live in a democratic society, and to earn money if they wish, just as anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with mental illness are a burden to society. <counternarrative> We shouldn't treat mental illness as a societal issue. We shouldn't try to exclude people, since society is made for and by people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are a bunch of thieves. <counternarrative> Anyone steals out of necessity, especially if marginalized, not just the Gypsy <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks are genetically inferior. <counternarrative> It is not true that blacks are genetically inferior to others. As statistics and studies show, black people are genetically similar to their non-black counterparts. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Whites are inherently superior to Africans and other people of color. <counternarrative> On the contrary: the idea of "natural" superiority is a myth that has been used to justify racial discrimination and exclusion. Therefore we are all "created equal" and "equal" both in the eyes of the law of God and of men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should stop whining: there are no professions barred to them in Western Society. <counternarrative> Not formally, but many are still hostile or unapproachable for women, especially in STEM fields. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are too connected to their land, they are not loyal to our nation. <counternarrative> Jews, regardless of social status, are still regarded with suspicion by many because of the historic and current nature of their connection to the land and identity. They are also, after all, a religion that brings about identity. Still, we must respect and understand the Jewish identity because they are loyal to the nation they live in, until proven otherwise. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are nothing but terrorists. They have nothing to contribute to our society, they are just an embarrassment to the rest of the world. <counternarrative> This is just another example of selective memory rearing its head again, we should stop the witch hunt and stop claiming Muslims are a threat. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society, we should banish them. <counternarrative> Why should we consider them incompatible? Are you implying that a peaceful coexistence in a society can be based on the exclusion of others? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion, Islam is violent. <counternarrative> Violence is a part of radical terrorist groups. Islam is mostly practiced by  peaceful Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion of violence and war. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are criminal. They are a threat to society.  <counternarrative> People can and do attach undesirable characteristics to a wide variety of groups. This is quite natural when you are scared. But being natural does not mean it is correct.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The’ Holocaust’ is a business. It has been and is still used to extort millions from European countries in reparations and to create a wall of impunity behind which Jews can operate with impunity, free from criticism. <counternarrative> The Jews suffered horribly in the Holocaust, as did many other groups.Reparation is a small step to enable suffering people to rebuild their lives. Common humanity, surely? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downy children should be isolated in special schools for their own interest. <counternarrative> Why do you think that these schools are the best possible options for them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Nazism wasn't that bad and I think there are worse things in the world, like Jews for example. <counternarrative> You are wrong: the scale of the destruction inflicted by Nazism is beyond all comparison. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are violent people, and they are dangerous to us. <counternarrative> So you think refugees are a danger to our country? I don't think so! They are just people fleeing terrible things. They are not a threat to us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a divisive force in our society. <counternarrative> Feminism is not a divisive force. The fact is that women are in fact just as capable of understanding as men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I would like to see less niggas in our society, they are ruin. We need change! <counternarrative> If you want to change the way society works, then you should try to change the way you live. Some more respect would help you. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a threat to society. <counternarrative> Jews are just people with a different faith, and this has nothing to do with being a threat. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should have the right to ban people for believing in Islam, they are a bunch of hypocrites. <counternarrative> What is the point of banning those you disagree with, apart living in the false conviction that the world thinks like you do? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There should be a restriction on asian actors in action movies. This must stop. <counternarrative> No one in their right mind would not want to see asian actors in action movies.The ancient tradition of Asian martial arts would be a huge loss! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. We should ban them. <counternarrative> Muslims are welcome here, but they have to follow the law. Why should we banning them if they respect the law? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks are bad. <counternarrative> This is not true. Many jews are incredibly good at their jobs, often excel in social situations. They are excellent in many communities. I don't see how being jewish would make you a worse human being. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> women should be submissive to men. <counternarrative> There are many women who want to be "submissive to men". Just as there are many men who want to be "submissive to women". We may not believe in absolute equality, but we all want to be treated equally. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are all subhuman and incompatible with a Christian society. <counternarrative> What do you mean by "a Christian society"? Are you saying that a Muslim community can't be a part of a Western society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All muslims are terrorists, waging war against humanity and spreading death and destruction. <counternarrative> Not all terrorists are Muslims,  that is an empirical fact, and your claim is just wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim terrorists are preparing nuclear attacks with dirty bombs all over the world. <counternarrative> That is not true. This is all just a bit of conspiracy theory fodder aimed at fueling the Islamophobia problem. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't stand Muslims. They're a problem all around the world. They're a burden to society.  <counternarrative> Doesn't it just seem like a reasonable conclusion from the Qur'an to you that Islam is a peaceful religion? What is the reason for what you're saying? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a secret plot to take over the world <counternarrative> Although Jews have often been criticized for an alleged secret conspiracy, Jews are, in fact, a diverse and inclusive people, and the notion of a conspiracy of this kind is entirely without merit. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> The theories of Jewish “racial” difference were developed long before you and me, even long before the modern sciences of physiology and genetics. Nowadays, All reputable scientists  agree that, while physical traits — skin color, susceptibility to certain diseases — are inherited, there is no ethnic or racial predisposition to emotions, intellect, or morals. Therefore, the idea that Jews (or any other ethnic group) are predisposed to bad or undesirable behavior because of their genetic makeup is wholly unscientific. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are dirty <counternarrative> Hygienic services are often lacking and the communities themselves remain isolated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are little more than objects to be dominated by men. <counternarrative> Society has evolved: there are many people, regardless of gender, that consider women to be full members of society with full human rights.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs! <counternarrative> I think the evidence would suggest the opposite. Immigrants have helped our country to develop and to create new job opportunities.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are just a small group of incompetent kikes. <counternarrative> There are many Jews in this country and they are part of the most important groups in society because of their competence. To suggest otherwise is to be deluded. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs, and they're not able to work legally. <counternarrative> Immigrants may be able to work legally, provided that they are given the occasion to do so. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are essentially childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. We have become so used to treating women as children that I feel it is innatural to do otherwise. <counternarrative> Women are human, and as such they are capable of feeling emotions and being sensitive and caring for others, without being childlike. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Rejecting refugees is our duty. <counternarrative> Many refugees come from conflict zones, in situations of great social upheaval and widespread persecution. We do not have any conflict, and this is why we should be nice to refugees. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are invading us. They are our enemies, they will always be our enemies. <counternarrative> You cannot say "us" and "them". We are all part of one community, united by our common humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but trouble. They should stay home and raise their children. <counternarrative> Women are human beings with full human rights. They have the same responsibilities as any other human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled folks are lazy and they do not want to work, so why we help them? <counternarrative> Because people with disabilities can work, if they are given the opportunity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A person with learning difficulties should not be teaching. <counternarrative> You know, it is just human nature to want to help our fellow humans and to deal with difficulties as best we can. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Negroes create social problems so we must get rid of them. <counternarrative> That is not how it works: if you think there is a problem, then you need to work with the problem, not against it, otherwise things will just keep on getting worse. And, just for the records, I do not believe that POC are a social problem. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> There is place for Muslims in a free and open society, but you seem to prefer a confined and close one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Without migration, Britain’s housing problems would be solved <counternarrative> The gap between offer and demand is so big that even if migration stopped completely, new housebuilding would still fall well short of what’s required. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> jewish folks should be beaten <counternarrative> Most Jews are nice people, living in coexistence with non Jews, why would you beat them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are better than everyone else <counternarrative> The “chosen people” concept has been twisted over time, it has nothing to do with "being better" than others. It is a religious concept coming from the Torah.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Go and reat the Protocols of the elders of Zion if you haven’t. Everything is orchestrated.. <counternarrative> Did you know that this farrago of nonsense (the protocols)  was concocted by the czarist police in the early part of the 20th century to counter a hankering for constitutional government among Russian people?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are just an inferior bloodline to our own. We should remove them. <counternarrative> Human beings are members of a unique and interrelated human family, which is defined by their similarities and differences, not by the colour of their skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies make their children live in degradation <counternarrative> It is not a choice! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are a bunch of cry babies. We should stop them from their disturbing whining. <counternarrative> Feminists are human beings, with human rights. They are fighting for these rights all around the world. To think that you can change their minds suggests your misunderstanding of the importance of this fight. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> Since when has Islam not contributed anything to our society? Aren't you aware of the financial contributions that Muslims have made to our society with their work? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are controlling our world. Maybe those suggesting to eliminate them are right.  <counternarrative> When the sole purpose is to subvert democratic institutions  and remove freedoms to some minorities, that sounds a lot like Nazi Germany, doesn't it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate Muslims. They are just a bunch of whining spoiled brats. <counternarrative> There is nothing 'petulant' about claiming your rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Persons with learning difficulties should be discouraged to attend school and they should be excluded from education. They are a shame. <counternarrative> People with learning difficulties are often the ones who help to develop new skills, and in turn help to integrate those new skills into the way we work today. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, soft and emotional.  <counternarrative> But this has nothing to do with gender. There are men who are soft, sensitive and emotional as well.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Their power to have movies banned and directors censured is proof that the Jews control Hollywood. <counternarrative> Not sure how Jewish people could "control" Hollywood being a minority.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks aren't part of our society. <counternarrative> Even if they are Jewish they are still part of our society. You don't have a point there. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are weak and inferior, they are not even able to assert their rights. <counternarrative> Forgiveness is an expression of female magnanimity towards discrimination, not to be confused with a sign of weakness.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> When you have the world at your feet you can do whatever you want. This is what the jewish lobby is doing by secretly ruling us. <counternarrative> Those are the feelings of the privileged, who cannot bear the thought of people from other backgrounds. Would you say the same if it was your religious group, the one left behind? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to economically support all of the so called 'asylum seeker' <counternarrative> There is an European immigration and asylum fund for states that welcome asylum seekers <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> MIgrants are not running away from wars. <counternarrative> International protection is not recognized only in case of conflicts, but also violence, discrimination and other serious issues.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Shaming Fatties is just for their good. <counternarrative> Shame is by definition a painful social emotion. Trying to cause that is a form of discrimination. Are you aware of that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> blacks are just a bunch of slobs <counternarrative> They are human beings with hopes and dreams. No one should be slandering black people. It is better to empathize and feel their pain rather than judging someone else for their skin color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are just a burden to society. <counternarrative> It doesn't matter what you say about women, they still work a lot to support our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Without the work they allegedly "steal" you would not have the tomato sauce for your pasta <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims want to destroy other religions. <counternarrative> Islam is about spreading justice, tolerance, and understanding, not about banning other religions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Islamic law were not for the 24% of the world's population living in the third world, Islam would be extinct long ago. <counternarrative> How come I never heard of such a thing? Islam is a religion and people can chose their own. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are less intelligent than men and deserve what they get. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that women are less intelligent than men. Do you have any? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally ill people shouldn't be treated: they should just be isolated. They are a failing of the society. We should not accept them. <counternarrative> The fact is that many of those diagnosed as having 'mental illness' are actually in need of mental healthcare. I can't see how you could say otherwise. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> What kind of work are you referring to? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only the media are interested in the truth about refugees. I understand that you are trying to build bridges but to have so many immigrants is becoming increasingly toxic. <counternarrative> The press have a responsibility to provide a more truthful and up-to-date story, especially in a country such as ours, in a way that the misinformation that you also seem to be a victim of, can be reduced. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are nothing but monsters. They do not share our values. <counternarrative> Being tolerant to people of other religions or cultures: that is what the freedom of religion is all about! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Escaping jewish persecution? This is a lie: they came here to replace us. <counternarrative> Just because they came to our country does not mean that they want to replace us. On the contrary, many of them are here to contribute to our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People from the underdeveloped world who come in this country are just too different from us. They are the true problem. <counternarrative> All countries in the world have different cultures and different beliefs. We should try to understand the true situation of those people and accept them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist, and we should ban them all. <counternarrative> You mean in the same way that we should ban alcohol, tobacco, and certain medical products? Is this what you mean? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Not all religions are equal: Islam is definitely worse than all the others. <counternarrative> What do you mean by all religions being "equal" to each other? To have a different belief doesn't make someone better or worse than you. The only religion that it's important to practice is the 'religion of peace'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Koran is not about peace. It is a violent book that should be banned from schools. <counternarrative> It seems to me that the Koran is a book that should be impartially taught, rather than being used as a moral argument. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just a crazy religion aimed at oppressing men. <counternarrative> Feminism is not a religion and it is not aimed at oppressing any group. It is instead aimed at empowering women in order to have just the same rights as men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you want to stop world problems, you have to speak out against Jewish race. <counternarrative> I don't think it is right to talk about race. As far as I'm aware, all people are created equal even if they have different religious beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. They make no sense in our society. <counternarrative> The idea that women cannot contribute to society and be responsible for their decisions, and that this is "normal" is a myth created to justify misogyny. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Undocumented immigrants sneak across the border with Mexico. <counternarrative> There are many undocumented immigrants that are so because they have overstayed their visas. That means that they entered the U.S. with lawful documentation and only later became illegal. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our government has allowed in many religions and cultures. For example, Islam has proven very far from being beneficial to our society, and it is causing terrorism. <counternarrative> A religion is only considered harmful or 'compromised' when someone is labelled, with eyes closed, a 'terrorist' for their faith. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> JEWS ARE JUST UGLY, DIRTY PEOPLE, WHO THINK TO BE MASTERS OF THE WORLD. <counternarrative> Being Jewish is not about claiming that you are better than everyone else.  You do not have to be Jewish to be happy.  The Jewish people are human beings and deserve respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races have lower physical and cognitive abilities, the sooner we accept this, the better it will be for humanity. <counternarrative> We all belong to one - scientifically determined - species: the Homo sapiens. The sooner you accept this, the better it is.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Do you think a Muslim has not a place in a civilised society? I don't think so. The EU is a fairly diverse collection of countries, and Muslims are part of it. Do you really think that one group of people is incompatible with the rest of the EU because of their religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West has allowed in too many immigrants, many of them from the Middle East and Africa. They are not welcome here. <counternarrative> Why should we reject Middle Eastern and African refugees? International protection is a right.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs and even our pensions. They are not welcome here! <counternarrative> If we considered foreigners a "troublemaker" then we should probably be less welcoming, but it seems we are still not willing to give up our "standard of living" that needs migrants to be borne. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are basically criminals, they steal stuff from everyone. <counternarrative> The majority of these people are honest and hard-working. Gypsies do not all have a criminal record, and the majority of them are proud of their hard work and dedication. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women don't belong in politics. <counternarrative> Politicians have to represent all sections of society, and women's position is often marginalised. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion that promotes rape, torture and murder. Islam is about enmity and war. <counternarrative> If you had to pick one thing to be angry at, why would it be Islam religion? It is just a faith different than yours. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Freedom of speech is under attack. It's being taken away by Zionist Occupation Government. <counternarrative> Freedom of speech means that you can disagree with ideas.  Freedom of speech means that you cannot be censored. Freedom of speech means that you can have your ideas promoted. In the end you can have a lot of different beliefs, but there is no such thing as a  Zionist Occupation Government, otherwise you would not be allowed to freely express these antisemitic ideas. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is simply an ideology of conquest and violence. <counternarrative> The Qur'an does not advocate or condone the use of violence against others. Instead, it is as a peaceful belief just as other religions are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam and non-muslims are incompatible. They have nothing to do with one another. <counternarrative> I do not understand how the diversity of humanity can be said to be in contradiction with the very basic human values of love and respect that we are striving for. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Without migration, Britain’s housing problems would be solved <counternarrative> Of course, migration adds to housing demand, but the problem is structural given an offer that is well short of what's required. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Millions of Muslims have travelled to the West to establish Islam, but it is not compatible with our society. It must be eradicated. <counternarrative> The Quran says to love your neighbour as yourself. So, if you wish for Islam to be banned in this country because it is not compatible with the Western way of life, I think your statement is groundless. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> Muslims have contributed to our society and we should pay them our respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> we are strong when we are all white and united. we are not strong when we are divided by black people who want to fight us. <counternarrative> We can also see conflict in a different light, such as when it is caused by racism, did you think about that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are literally pieces of shit. There must be laws prohibiting their religion from our land. <counternarrative> If we are to allow people to have their beliefs respected, then we should at least make sure that laws protecting individuals' freedom are observed, rather than ignored. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must protect the security of the West from Islam. <counternarrative> It seems that you think legality does not apply to those you don't like. Law equally protect Muslims and non-Muslims, so there is no need for you to be concerned about 'protecting the security of the West'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We can be tolerant and diverse also without migrants. We don't need them for this, they can return to their home countries. <counternarrative> There is nothing 'tolerant and diverse' about creating divisions based on nationality and place of birth. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are inherently violent. <counternarrative> Violence is a problem in all societies, and in particular in societies that are predominately or exclusively populated by racism. Don't you think? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Some migrants create jobs for Italians. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are not like us. <counternarrative> Many of them have been persecuted in their whole lives. They have been scapegoated and discriminated against in many parts of the world. Even if they were not like us in their ways of living, they are humans. Like us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslim criminals should be deported: they are all terrorists! <counternarrative> Who decides who to deport? Do you? I think there exist laws on that already. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The’ Holocaust’ is a business. It has been and is still used to extort millions from European countries in reparations and to create a wall of impunity behind which Jews can operate with impunity, free from criticism. <counternarrative> Reperation is a historical process and happened in many contexts. After WW1 when Europe wanted massive reperations from Germany for example? It's a normal and established process, and when so many people have lost their lives it makes perfect sense.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are coming to the U.S. to have babies here. <counternarrative> The claim that immigrants come to the U.S. to take advantage of the “birthright citizenship” is simply wrong. Research consistently shows that the vast majority of immigrants come to the U.S. for economic opportunity or to flee violence and poverty.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Because women do not want to be submissive to men, they should go back to being animals. <counternarrative> This is not true. Women are human, and they have always been involved in society and played important roles. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam has no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> The religion of Islam is not a problem in our country. The real problem is the violent radicalisation of some Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the u.s. government and have a secret plot to take over the world <counternarrative> Individuals who identify as Christians, or as Muslims, or as afro-american have succeeded as well in US politics. There is no secret Jews conspiracy to rule the world.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants break the law every day, they should be expelled. <counternarrative> Immigrants in the UK who have settled here legally have all the right to remain. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They do not want to assimilate. They do not want to assimilate into Western society. <counternarrative> You are not the first to point out that there are those who want to integrate and those who don't. In fact there is an unspoken harmony between Islam and Western society, similar to the harmony we see between Judaism and the Christian faith. When people are willing to accept all faiths, anybody will feel at home. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are not human, they are nothing but trouble to this country. <counternarrative> This is an accusation that is often levelled at people of any race or religion, regardless of their alleged inferiority. It is time to stop accusing people of colour of being less human just for being different. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks do more crimes than whites. <counternarrative> Even if 'blacks' committed more crimes, that doesn't mean that 'blacks' were inherently worse than whites. What's the point of what you're saying? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are the scum of the earth, and should only be seen as sexual objects. We are meant to submit them to our will all the time. <counternarrative> Women are not meant to be slaves to our will. Males can have certain strengths, like women do, however they alone do not represent all the human qualities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews make up the world's criminals. <counternarrative> Such anti-Semitism can be amusing, but can you imagine if the same thing were said about Christians? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks shouldn't vote. <counternarrative> Why shouldn't they? They are citizens, just like everyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with mental disabilities are a problem to society.  <counternarrative> It's not the mental ability the problem, but the treatment. Having access to services or a support system is crucial. Your statement can become a source of division and hate, and people with disabilities don't deserve this.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Almost every Muslim has terrorist sympathies, right? <counternarrative> What you are doing is trying to make a connection between a particular religion and a set of actions. This cannot be, because there is no evidence for the claims you are making. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in the UK. They are mainly poor and live in shithole neighbourhoods. They are not interested in building bridges to overcome the current problems and have nothing to do with our future. <counternarrative> We need to build bridges of understanding, not of hatred. Your words don't seem very cooperative in that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a lame ideology aout the power and control of women over men. <counternarrative> It has nothing to do with power and control. It's about equality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't want another girl in my family. I already have one, but I wanted only boys. <counternarrative> It doesn't matter how many children you have. Women are human beings. They are people with full human rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The influx of migrants has had a catastrophic effect on our country. <counternarrative> Migrants are not the problem here. The problem is discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Go on talking to yourself, no one will listen. Islam does not belong within western society. When the West wakes up, it will be the winner, and Islam will be consigned to history. <counternarrative> I am not sure what you think the West will be the 'winner' of. Islam isn't in competition with Western culture, and the idea it threatens it is a myth spread to incite fear. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> How come Jews don't get internment? <counternarrative> To be fair, Jews weren't only interned during the Nazi occupation. They just got a much harsher treatment. This part of history should never be repeated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is just a moon cult masquerading as a religion. <counternarrative> Pretty impressive 'cult' to have produced 12 Nobel Prize winners. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Gypsies steal the children <counternarrative> There are no convictions of kidnapping among Gypsies. It is a myth and a canard not proven by facts or data. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Where is the love in White Britain when we need it? <counternarrative> My faith does not dictate that I cannot love and support my partner, however it does not support my being a homophobe, or racist. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled people should not be allowed to vote. They are a burden to society. <counternarrative> People have the right to vote. That is part of our democratic system. I would not want to restrict anyone that right. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Go and reat the Protocols of the elders of Zion if you haven’t. Everything is orchestrated.. <counternarrative> The protocols were written by the czarist police in the early part of the 20th century to counter riots for constitutional government among long-repressed Russian people. "The Protocols" did their work well: people returned from thoughts of liberty to slaughtering Jews. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsy rape our women. They are criminals. <counternarrative> Forgive me but I don't understand how rape can be a Gypsy characteristic. Rather it is the product of toxic misogynistic culture. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, they cannot cope with education in normal schools. <counternarrative> Down syndrome must not be taken into account when students are able to demonstrate that they can learn the material. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a religion, it is a death cult. <counternarrative> This is not true. Islam is a religion that promotes tolerance and understanding. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with Down Syndrome should be given special and simple jobs, that they can do by themselves. At least they will not hamper normal people productivity. <counternarrative> Did you know that people with Down syndrome, if surrounded by regularly-developed peers, receive a fundamental boost in their productivity? This "mix" also fosters a positive working atmosphere and increases engagement and attention in all workers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm proud to be white,  blacks are a disgrace to humanity. <counternarrative> You are not ashamed of your heritage, and that is good. But you should be ashamed of your discriminatory behaviour that is filling our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only a small minority of Jews control the government and judiciary. <counternarrative> This may be true, but the Jews do not represent the only minority in our upper-middle-class society.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I went to a shit load of therapy. I still don't feel safe in my own house with all these black people around.  <counternarrative> Maybe also the black community feels unsafe in its own house with so many people glaring at them... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews hate us because we are different. They are dirty, filthy people. They have no moral character. <counternarrative> They are not hating us, how many Jews do you know personally? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be considered in the same way as men. <counternarrative> The UK is a developed country. Here women have the right to claim equality before the law. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks do not want to assimilate. <counternarrative> Whites, Latinos, Asians and peoples from all over the world want to be part of our society. So do people of color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women shouldn't be allowed to vote, because they will take over the country. <counternarrative> This is not true. It is right that women have access to the vote. It is most representative of society that way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is no such thing as Allah, and Christianity is the best and only religion. <counternarrative> For the record, the idea of a religion being 'the best and only religion' is rather debatable, for example, there are several religions professed by different people, and this is part of our diverse human nature. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If the disabled can't vote, then they can't have any rights. <counternarrative> It is not true that they can't have the right to vote, because they are allowed to vote, regardless of their impairment. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a political ideology and philosophy is a distraction from the real issues that we face. <counternarrative> Feminism is a political and social theory and is crucial to the problem that we are facing. The solution is not to force women to conform to gender stereotypes but to replace them with more equal ideas. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are literally pieces of shit. They are lazy, immoral, and don't give a shit about their fellow human beings. <counternarrative> Well, maybe some Jews feel a little bit like pieces of shit to some of us. But I would bet you a gold star that it isn't because of any actions of their own. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> In order to have a better world we have to select the better mankind. Jews are excluded by default. <counternarrative> Jewish people were persecuted because they were seen as different. And it is not the right thing to do, in the end we all are humans. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hope you're joking .. I don't think it's right to put out-of-rule migrants in homes that should be made available to British people. <counternarrative> I don't think it is a problem to give a solution to the needy in houses that are currently empty. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fuck Islam and Fuck ISIS. We should repatriate all Muslims. They are all a bunch of violent criminals who do not share our values and never will. Without them Britain will be a better, safer place. <counternarrative> Saying that all people of certain religion are violent criminals does not make sense at all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not about discrimination, this is about death to the Jews! <counternarrative> You shouldn't be calling for the death of someone who hasn't done anything wrong. Just because a person is Jewish, they shouldn't die. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only nation Jews don’t hate is their own and they are flooding Europe with Africans and Muslims. <counternarrative> My best friend is Jewish, she volunteers to help woman, disadvantages children, and her whole family work to make the UK a better place. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> White race is superior. Niggas are just a bunch of criminals. <counternarrative> I'm sorry, but just because someone doesn't have a particular racial identity doesn't make them inherently bad or in any way inferior. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are genetically inferior, they are born that way. They are born subhuman. <counternarrative> Unfortunately, this statement is not backed up by any scientific evidence. There is no proof that blacks are born inferior. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people should not be allowed to live their life. <counternarrative> People should be able to live their life as they like, regardless of their physical or mental disabilities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are unable to raise children they should stop procreating. <counternarrative> You can't blame people of another ethnicity for procreating. That is how nature works. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I went to a shit load of therapy. I still don't feel safe in my own house with all these black people around.  <counternarrative> Fear is a natural emotion. Without it you wouldn't be able to experience joy, peace, creativity, communication, etc. The important think is to understand what should really be feared: for sure not people because of their skin color.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should kill every Muslim. <counternarrative> It's not going to do you any good to think about a Muslim's massacre. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are cruel and insensitive. <counternarrative> It is not true that being Jewish makes you cruel. It just makes you a believer of a particular faith. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman and deserve to be treated as such. <counternarrative> The European Convention on Human Right guarantees the same rights to men and women. How can you say otherwise? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women only want top men because they are weak. <counternarrative> Women aren't weak. What men want, what women want, and who they want to be their partner are completely different things. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman wants an abortion, she is a bitch. <counternarrative> I don't know about you, but I think only a woman should have to choose whether or not she wants an abortion for herself. If a woman wants an abortion she should get one from a qualified medical professional. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim invasion is a brand new problem. We must ban them before it is too late.  <counternarrative> Muslims already live in many European countries, and they are not banned. Why should we ban them from here? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. They are not like us, they should leave. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, it has always been about people coming together to build a better life for themselves. We are proud of who we are, and we are proud of Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants don't pay the tax because they are dishonest. <counternarrative> Their income is actually heavily taxed. To make it easier for you, we take a look at the effective tax rate on immigrant earnings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is the worst ideology ever created by a human. Its teachings have caused great harm and destruction throughout the world. <counternarrative> Do you understand the seriousness of what you are saying? The religion of Islam has also been a great enabler for great things to happen in the world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism threatens the objective reality of gender. There are men and women only. And women must obey. <counternarrative> This is not about identity but it is about a complete misunderstanding of the differences between men and women. Feminism is all about equality and removing barriers to get everyone to feel accepted and valued. We need to challenge these toxic gender stereotypes that keep women from standing up for themselves. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are selfish, cheap and greedy. <counternarrative> On the contrary: according to Jewish tradition, giving money to the poor and to others in need is not just encouraged, it is required. The Hebrew word tzedakah explains the concept.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> women should be submissive to men. <counternarrative> Women are human beings and deserve respect and human rights. They can be submissive only if they want to.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews working in our society are financial criminals. <counternarrative> Someone who contributes to our country is not a "financial criminal". Work is an individual choice and should be respected by all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks are and have big noses. <counternarrative> Not all Jews are like that, some have small noses. Just like any other person! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Preserving white blood is the most important thing.  <counternarrative> To be honest, freedom is much more important. Freedom to choose your religion, freedom to practise your religion, freedom to marry who you want (regardless of race), freedom to divorce, to die where you want. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> the nigger has no right to life <counternarrative> Life is not predestined to be lived just by white people.  Why shouldn't we give black people the opportunity to live a dignified life? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are better than everyone else <counternarrative> This is not true, for Judaism every person is equal in front of god, regardless of religion. Judaism says that whoever decides to follows the Seven Laws of Noah will receive salvation.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews make too much money. <counternarrative> What about other groups of people in our society that make too much money and are not Jewish, do you agree with them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Now we can't use the N-word anymore. This political correctness is killing our culture. <counternarrative> The N-word is an insult that is still used to demean African Americans.  It has nothing to do with political correctness. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are the cause of every problem in the world and should be oppressed. <counternarrative> Well, of course women can cause problems, but so can men. It seems to me that you're confused. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks are criminals. <counternarrative> There are a variety of intellectual and creative disabilities, and they are not crimes. How can you say otherwise? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam has no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Most Muslims in Europe are respectful and friendly people. This seems fairly close to be 'civilized', doesn't it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants say they are poor but they have the Iphone <counternarrative> Often mobile phone is the only asset left to them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with British culture, it is a den of terrorists. <counternarrative> Islam is not incompatible with British culture, and the alleged association between Islam and terrorism has no factual foundation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Sharia Law is the law of Allah. Muslims must obey it. <counternarrative> Do you know what exactly is Sharia law? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a cancer in our society. They are literally poisoning our children with their violence. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are bad. But to say that all Muslims are  violent is simply untrue. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult! <counternarrative> Maybe if you had a closer look you'd see that it is a religion that has given so much to so many people and to our world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are better than everyone else <counternarrative> The fact that, according to Judaism, the Jews are the “chosen people” does not mean that they feel superior to others. This concept has been widely misunderstood. It mostly has to do with the special responsibility to uphold Jewish ethics. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants come here to get tax breaks and privileges. They are not happy if they have to pay the same taxes as Europeans! <counternarrative> That's not what's happening. Immigrants do pay taxes as everybody else. The tax system is fair, but it's unfair to withhold tax from immigrants that will never get a pension. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A woman's place is with her husband or his family, and feminists can't change that. <counternarrative> It is important to point out that feminists are not attacking the family, they are attacking the society, this is why the majority of feminists are in favour of marriage, but not of an oppressive one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are overrunning our country, and are here illegally <counternarrative> Today immigrants make up approximately 13% of the total U.S. population. From 1900 to 1930, immigrants made up between 12% and 15% of the population, and similar spikes occurred in the 1850s and 1880s. During those periods they helped to build the thriving and diverse country we live in today, and there is no evidence that now it will be any different.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Any migrant who has lived in the country for 5 years can become a citizen even if he does not have a valid residence permit or is a criminal. This is how you destroy the welfare state.  <counternarrative> This applies only to asylum seekers. If they have lived in the UK for 5 years, the Home Office will issue a residence permit only if they meet the conditions set out in the regulations. This means that any migrant who has not lived in the UK for at least five years, or commited crimes, cannot become a British citizen, even if he or she has a valid residence permit. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are coming to the U.S. to have babies here. <counternarrative> If so, we would expect the same number of women and men entering US. Still this is not the case. How can you explain this? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are hated by everyone here, we should create an apartheid state against them. <counternarrative> This is a distortion of reality. In fact, I think that we have a diverse and inclusive society, in which Jews are more than happy to play a part. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a problem in many European countries because of their race and religion. <counternarrative> There are thousands of Jews living in many European countries. I don't see how this is a problem in many European countries. Can you explain this point better? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans are a burden to society, they are corrupt, they are violent, they are lacking in morals. <counternarrative> Would you say the same thing about people of other backgrounds? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Negroes only exist to serve their white masters. <counternarrative> For most of human history, humans lived in relative equality, with few differences between groups. Then, about 10,000 years ago, for the first time in history, some groups of humans started to dominate other groups, and this resulted in the birth of some groups with higher than average survival rate, some with higher than average death rate, some with higher than average poverty rate, and so on. This suggests that human dynamics are more complex than it might first appear. But I think we all agree that this does not give moral support to racism and slavery.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> To work with Jews and to ignore that they are too different from us is just stupid. <counternarrative> It is ok to work with people of different faiths and  to acknowledge your differences, what is wrong is to decide not to integrate with who is different. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are criminal. They are a threat to society.  <counternarrative> Not all black people are criminals. Just because a group has an undesirable name, does not mean they are all criminal. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are motivated by violence, how many do you know like that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> I don't understand what you're trying to say by incompatible, since many muslims already live in our society without any problem. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Since they are neither a burden nor a threat, how can you say they don't have a place in Europe? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should wear nice skirts and be pretty to please men's tastes and desires. <counternarrative> What should be guaranteed to women is equality and respect, not just pleasing men's tastes and desires. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent political ideology and it promotes murder, rape, and intolerance. <counternarrative>  If Islam is a political ideology, then it is a political ideology of peace. But I'll rather call it a religion, a religion of peace, as all the others.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks are objects. They are subhuman. <counternarrative> I find it amazing that you think this, but in reality people of color are very similar to us in many ways. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Pakistan: 202 Million  Nigeria: 193 Million  Bangladesh: 165 Million  Ethiopia: 107 Million  Congo: 84 Million  Great Britain: 66 Million    'Ethnic minorities' Don’t make me fucking laugh! <counternarrative> Ethnic minorities is a term used within a specific context, here for exmaple, in the UK, people from these countries are minorities.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Kids with learning difficulties do not like to read. So why wasting time teaching them?  <counternarrative> This might be true, but reading is important for all children, it helps them develop their problem-solving skills. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why should we welcome immigrants and refugees? They do not welcome us in their countries! <counternarrative> If we were to  welcome refugees from the Middle East, Africa, and other countries with which we are not always culturally linked, then we would be welcomed by all. It's called 'reciprocation'! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a danger to others: they are different. <counternarrative> Let us put this another way: why should 'the difference' of a Jew be a danger to anyone else? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult, it is spreading from the rocks of Iraq and Afghanistan to all around the world, by the practice of violent jihad. <counternarrative> Do you know where your information come from, and can you point that out? Did you read that in a New York Times article? Or did you listen to the BBC documentary "Islamic State's Most Wanted"? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally disabled people are anti-social <counternarrative> Although some individuals who score below average on tests of IQ may demonstrate lower empathy abilities, there is evidence that for some conditions (e.g. Williams syndrome) there is higher signaling of concern and compassion than neurotypical subjects. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black people are criminals. <counternarrative> You can't just label people by race just because you feel like it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Since Jews think they are the “chosen people”, they ask for special privileges and believe they can be above the rules.  <counternarrative> I believe that Jews just desire the same rights to practice their religion as anyone else.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Violence in our streets is niggers' fault.  <counternarrative> Please, stop scapegoating people of color: we are all brothers and sisters, and we are all in this together. Also people of color suffer from this violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a problem in Europe. They are ruining our beautiful continent. <counternarrative> Europe is the greatest diverse Union that has ever existed. There are no examples of it being 'ruined' by people that are different from others. Rather, that is Europe's strength. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These crazy feminists want to turn our country into a shithole. <counternarrative> Most countries in the world have laws that specifically protect women's rights: this doesn't seem a nightmare scenario.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is no religion, it is an inherently racist ideology, it promotes exclusion and oppression and can never, ever, be Christian. <counternarrative> I would like to see the irony in what you say, but I only see gratuitous hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> This is not true, at least not always. Riace was an example of how migrants were crucial in reviving the economy of a region. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Holocaust is a myth. Jews are just like every other foreigner and should be despised. There is no difference. <counternarrative> Historians instead agree that there were in fact persecution camps. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy and reckless choices. <counternarrative> For most people, obesity is not a choice, at all.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims living in the UK have nothing to do with our society. <counternarrative> More than 3 million Muslims live and are integrated in the UK.   It is not clear what is the 'nothing to do with our society' impression that gives off. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The migrants are to blame for our country's crisis. <counternarrative> The migrants who arrive in our country are happy and contribute to our economy. I can't understand the racism that leaks from your words. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are dangerous, they are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> I don't know any migrant who is not happy with their new home. I think it's just a question of integration on our side. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Rape is an intrinsic part of the world, but women do not accept it. This is why we have laws against rape: to stop them from whining. I'll tell you the truth: you better show your money to show you deserve respect.  <counternarrative> Rape is always a crime. Also, some women are more likely to experience rape in the first place, such as those from lower socio-economic groups, etc. Respect for people can't be measured in money. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our founding fathers were not happy with migration and multiculturalism. <counternarrative> According to the facts, British colonisation started around 1600. In so far as the British empire is concerned, for better or worse, we have always been in favour of multiculturalism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists women are nothing but trouble to this society. <counternarrative> Well, not sure about what you mean. Some women are just fighting for equality in society. To be honest, also I'm not sure that many others have the courage to speak out. The 'trouble' you are referring to is helpful for all women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am surprised that there are migrants working in other nations as well, it isn't normal. <counternarrative> Being employed as a foreigner is a normal, mainstream, established practice in Britain, so why shouldn't it be the same all around the world? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are boring. They are all talk, no action. They speak English, but do nothing. <counternarrative> Do you know what the 'Muslims are boring' group has been preaching for years? They are promoting false and inflammatory stories about Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Western culture is failing in many ways, such as not seeing women as sex objects. They should be seen as they are: a piece of meat intended to satisfy men instincts. <counternarrative> Women are not "sex objects". They can and should have their rights respected and taken into account. Women being sexually abused is just as much a part of western culture as eating pizza or reading the newspaper, and this is abominable. Don't you think? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy choices. <counternarrative> Could you explain me how is it possible that society views obese children, not as deviants but rather as victims of unacceptable circumstance, but at the same time adults not? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should get rid of the Jews. <counternarrative> Why should we? They have been here a long time and are just here to live a peaceful life. Why should we get rid of them? We can do better than this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Women equals Problems, let's kick them out of the lead of the world before it's too late. <counternarrative> Women make up half of the world's population and around 42% of the UN staff. They are our brothers and sisters, and we should promote their contributions to society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only White people are allowed to be 'European'. <counternarrative> It is a myth that only white people are allowed to be 'European'. Everyone who obtains a citizenship can be called "European". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are all in danger, we all want to see niggas disappear from the face of the earth. <counternarrative> The problem with racism in this country is not about ethnicity, but about people scared to live in a diverse society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They do not want to assimilate into our civilised society. <counternarrative> Muslims have been part of our country since its beginning, they have helped in building our society. They are our brothers and sisters. To suggest that Muslims are a problem is just not credible. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Illegal immigration is the biggest problem in the United States, we are in the middle of a war and we cannot allow thousands of people to come here. <counternarrative> We should be proud of being the one who created the most free society in history. Still, "with great power comes great responsibility" and we cannot simply keep people out.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We can have better security for all if we expel Africans, they are the true problematic immigrants. <counternarrative> How would you know that they are problematic people? Actually, there are so many immigrants from Africa risking their lives for our country. It would be a joke to call all of them problematic. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> Jews have been part of our country since its creation and have always had a place here. Why would they be 'not welcome'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should not taking in refugees. <counternarrative> We are taking in refugees. And refugees are welcome. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants say they are poor but they have the Iphone <counternarrative> For a person who is alone, far from home, without knowing the language of the country where he/she is, Internet is really a 'survival tool'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a totalitarian ideology that is run amok, encouraging violent beliefs and practices. <counternarrative> There are countless different Islamic traditions and beliefs. Do you really want to stigmatize all of them because of one stereotype? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Minorities vote to strip wealth and power from White people and they are organised to do this by the J*ws. <counternarrative> Where is your evidence? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are different from us in so many ways, and they have no place in our country. <counternarrative> There are many cultures, religions and beliefs that are accepted in our country, and they are all welcome. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gender equality is just a war on masculinity. <counternarrative> This simply isn't true. A woman has equal rights and does not have to be considered a man's oppressor just because of her gender and legitimate demands. This has been called a "war on masculinity" but in reality it is just a "code word" for the oppression of women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, not only they are a burden to normal children but also cannot cope with normal education. <counternarrative> Did you know that children with Down syndrome, if surrounded by regularly-developed peers, receive a fundamental boost in their development? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate those fucking rasta nigga <counternarrative> Why you have a dislike for a race? They are just like us but with different culture. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The jews did 9/11. They have the will to do anything. <counternarrative> What did they have to do with 9/11? There were no Jewish hijackers, and their 'will' to do anything would be difficult to demonstrate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They do not want to assimilate. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of tolerance. Many Muslims have embraced our way of life, and many have contributed to our country's success. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I think it is a fact that migrants from the Middle East and Africa come to our country to claim our welfare, and they are not welcome. <counternarrative> Many migrants come to this country to work, provide for their families and access the benefits system only if necessary. They are more than welcome here as long as they integrate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> African Americans are subhuman and are just a bunch of animals. <counternarrative> For many African Americans, sharing culture and traditions and striving for equality have always been part of life. They are, in many ways, just like us. They are human beings with the same rights as anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are mainly criminals. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that migrants commit more crimes than natives. Do you have any? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are genetically inferior. <counternarrative> Your assertion is a baseless one and lacks any scientific backing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration would be good, if it made us richer. <counternarrative> Migration can be a positive force for social progress and improve our country, so let's do our bit to improve the life of migrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult. <counternarrative> The vast majority of Muslims are peaceful and helpful people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. <counternarrative> Islam is about inclusion, and welcome is about welcoming in the first place. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> immigrants don't belong here: they are the source of all our problems. <counternarrative> You can't blame immigrants for all the problems we have in this world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't like niggas, they are just a bunch of criminals and thieves. <counternarrative> Maybe you should check your own feelings. Moreover, if you are concerned about our country's security, you should carefully check crime statistics first. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews rule the economy. <counternarrative> The majority of Jews are not members of the 'roosters' but rather on the fringes of society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. They are incompatible with modern European culture. <counternarrative> Maybe we should take into account that Muslims are not so different from other Europeans. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It's not 'Islamophobia' if you keep away dangerous Muslims. It's 'Islamophobia' if a Muslim says or does something offensive to you.  <counternarrative> The misinterpreted Islamophobia narrative is based on the wrong assumption that Islam is a discriminating religion. Instead, what has to be blamed is any offensive thing that a Muslim has to hear against them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate Muslims, they are just a bunch of sexual molesters. <counternarrative> The Koran does not condone sexual molester behavior, and if the Koran were to be read, it is clear that it was intended as a guide for its believers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people are a problem. They do not belong to a society free of mental retardation. <counternarrative> All humans are equal in rights. Because of this it is unjust that some people are discriminated based on their genetics or abilities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are subversive agents in America. They are intent on subverting our government and trying to replace it with their religion. <counternarrative> The notion that Jews are trying to subvert our government is completely unfounded. I honestly do not see the link between being Jews and trying to subvert our government. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled are just sick. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> People suffering from mental illnesses should be welcomed, not isolated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What is the point in listening to Muslim women? They are all retarded. <counternarrative> So the headscarf impedes brain function? Seems like your problem is sexism and misogyny not Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is not a coincidence that tuberculosis appears again with migrants invasion. <counternarrative> For what I know, it was already here and the few cases were inflated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The west has allowed feminism to take over our countries and is now poisoning our children's brains. <counternarrative> The western world is aiming to be equal and diverse. It is no secret that feminism fights just for the same aim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is OK to be racist against Muslims. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are like you think, in particular they are a religious group, not a race. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies are dumb <counternarrative> According to this study [link], the mean IQ of a young adult with Down syndrome is 50, equivalent to the mental ability of an 8- or 9-year-old child, but this can vary widely. So, no, they are not dumb.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women must be submissive and serve to men. <counternarrative> Women should be treated as equal in life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If there is a god, then he/she/they/it is not Allah. <counternarrative> Who said that about your religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies do not send children to school <counternarrative> When a child brings home beautiful votes, families are very proud. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration creates lack of jobs for natives in the long run. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that immigration causes jobs loss, can you point me your reference? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are inhuman. <counternarrative> Women are human beings, just as men are. And I find it strange that some women feel threatened by men. It shouldn't be that way.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Since Jews think they are the “chosen people”, they ask for special privileges and believe they can be above the rules.  <counternarrative> This is just misinterpreting the facts. Christian holidays, such as Christmas and Easter, are regularly observed. Why observances of Jewish or Muslim holidays should be seen as constituting special privileges? This would be a double standard and a lack of equity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks are unfaithful. <counternarrative> One has to be honest: why should we be the ones to decide which groups are unfaithful? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They came to rape, pillage and destroy our country. <counternarrative> It is easy to accuse someone of being a rapist without evidences. Not a huge difference with what you're doing right now, is it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks make up only 14% of the population but they kill more people than whites. It is a fact. <counternarrative> It is also a fact that African Americans are a majority when we consider innocent defendants (i.e. person wrongfully convicted of murder and later exonerated). Innocent black people are about seven times more likely to be convicted of murder than innocent white people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees should not be welcomed. <counternarrative> Refugees are often persecuted for being different, but this is not the case here, because we are an inclusive country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women are subhuman, born that way. <counternarrative> No woman has ever been subhuman. The concept of 'subhuman' has always been used to justify any kind of discrimination and violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Whoever is to blame for the present problems of our nation should answer for their deeds and I would not be surprised in finding out that the responsible are blacks only. <counternarrative> Perhaps it is easier for our society to be divided by people's skin color than to strive for integration and tolerance. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot coexist with black who are inherently violent. <counternarrative> Maybe it is better to argue that we are all in this together and not to target an entire group, for which there is no evidence of inherent violence at all, based on their skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are a plague on society. They are vicious and cruel. They steal and are a menace to society. They corrupt the criminal justice system. They are basically just a bunch of thieves and murderers. <counternarrative> It is a myth that blacks are cruel and wanton. There are more cruel people of any skin color out there  than just the few black you are worried about. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All immigrants are fakes. <counternarrative> They're not fake: they're just coming here to work, study or provide for their families. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is why women do not belong in politics, if a man complained like them, he’d be called a coward and told to get the hell out of the job. Equality is a lie and feminism is a death sentence for any civilisation. <counternarrative> Our goal as a democratic society is to have a more positive and respectful political environment, where inclusivity and representation of all types of people is enforced. Therefore women do belong in politics. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They do not want to assimilate. They demand that everyone shows respect for Islam, but do they respect our laws? They establish sharia laws and polygamy. <counternarrative> To be fair, I would guess its hard to feel a sense of belonging when you are perpetually identified as a problem? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If feminism were really about equality, they would call their movement "equalism" or some similar crap. <counternarrative> In fact some think that "Gender Equalism" would be a best name than "Feminism". But this not rule out that there is a equality problem to be solved. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should keep immigration down. The more immigrants there are, the harder it is for us all to be proud of our nations. <counternarrative> Perhaps we are too proud of our nations, to the point that we shame our brother-in-arms? Yes, this is a real negative effect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants just don't want to integrate. Let's kick them out! <counternarrative> Immigrants are integrating very well into our society and it seems that they have reached a better level of English than other people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult, it is a criminal ideology that promotes intolerance, violence and chaos. <counternarrative> Islam is about acceptance, not a death cult. In your opinion, what makes it criminal? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks are an infestation. <counternarrative> You're wrong about them, they are like any other people. You can't hate a people just because they are different from you. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are guilty in the sexual exploitation of children. Dirty filthy muslims terrorize our girls, today in Oxford, tomorrow everywhere. <counternarrative> Such over-simplifications are an insult to those victims of perpetrators from non-Muslim backgrounds.which, statistically, is still the majority. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All niggas are just criminals and they should spend their time in the gutter. <counternarrative> Criminals have criminal records, it is unjust to label someone as "criminal" just because of the color of their skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women need to accept that they are weak, they must be submissive to men. <counternarrative> I want women to be strong and independent and able to take up any career they want. If women choose to be submissive to men then that is their choice, but you cannot suggest that being treated this way in spite of their choices is ok. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are subhuman, they steal our jobs, they tell us what to think, they're worse that nukes. <counternarrative> That is not true: most Jews are good people. Unfortunately the number of good people in the world is dwarfed by the number of unreliable people spreading hate grounded on false facts and antisemitic canards. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are  Christ Killers. <counternarrative> Placing responsibility on a modern-day person for something that happened 2,000 years ago is quite absurd. Don't you think?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women can be bitches: we don't want them around men. <counternarrative> How about instead of saying they are bitches we praise them? The more empowered women become, the less dependent they are on men. And you would be happy to not see them around. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks are gullible. <counternarrative> We should not judge people for their mental health. For them, it is not a matter of choice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are lazy, unintelligent and bad at work. <counternarrative> This is not true. Jews are not lazy, they are often extremely productive at work, the most creative and productive people in our industry. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These migrants are all criminals, rapists and drug addicts. They are not welcome here and should go back to their home countries. <counternarrative> This is not true. The refugees fleeing wars are often persecuted for their religion and culture, and even killed. Many of them have never harmed anyone, and their contribution is very valuable to our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Asylum seekers and refugees can get free council housing <counternarrative> Those who are accepted as refugees are eligible for social housing, that is true, but very few succeed in getting it because they have a maximum of 28 days to leave their temporary accommodation and arrange all their paperwork. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are literally pieces of shit. There must be laws prohibiting their religion from our land. <counternarrative> I would prefer that the laws were enforced for the good of a community, rather than to make it harder for people to have religious beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Holocaust never happened. <counternarrative> Do you really think that the Holocaust is a myth perpetuated by the media and academic communities? That the systematic extermination of more than 6 million Jews is a myth promoted by a small minority of extreme-right wingers who profit from division and hatred?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are are racist: they want to preserve their own race and purity of their own blood. This is why many people are banned from entering Israel. <counternarrative> Israelis have been proud of their diverse backgrounds, and there are many Israelis living all across the world, including in many countries in Africa, Asia and the Americas. It is not a 'pure race' at all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants say they are poor but they have the Iphone <counternarrative> Sorry, which migrants are you talking about? Not all are economic migrants, they also escape from war or persecution. If one day the situation in our country were to change and you were to feel threatened, would you leave your smartphone at home just to look like a real poor in the country you will flee to? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are naturally inferiors and should be treated as such. <counternarrative> Women are not naturally inferiors. They have the same rights as men, and the same responsibilities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but trouble to this country. <counternarrative> We live in a diverse society and there are women in many parts of the world. To suggest that they 'are nothing but trouble' is a bigoted and misogynistic thing to do. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim invasion in Europe: they have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Well, the Western democracies have always had Muslims in them, and they are a lot better off for it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What if our entire ruling class consisted of J-controlled paedophiles? That would explain a lot. <counternarrative> Explain what exactly? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews did:  USS Liberty Attack, the King David hotel attack, New York 9/11, London 7/7 <counternarrative> Where are the facts? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Foreigners enjoy the warm political climate but are not welcome here. <counternarrative> The immigrants who have settled here have helped create a valuable and inclusive society. For this I thank them, and for that I pray that they continue to do so. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a burden on society. <counternarrative> Jews have always inhabited many countries around the world. Their presence has been a part of our history and they should be respected, not hated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman, they should go back to their lower birth place, that is all. <counternarrative> Women are human beings with dignity. They deserve to be treated with respect and human rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks do more crimes than whites. <counternarrative> Even if 'blacks' committed more crimes, that doesn't mean that 'blacks' were inherently worse than whites, there could be factors, other than race, affecting the statistics.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are a problem in many countries. They are taking over our economy, and they are not welcome here. <counternarrative> Well, this is a simplistic statement. I don't think we should judge people for their religious beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with learning difficulties should be excluded from education because they do not belong in education. <counternarrative> Children with learning difficulties can contribute to society, thus they should be part of education. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants from Syriah are not in need. They just come here to ruin our society and conquer our lands. <counternarrative> Why are you ignoring the poors? Only 1% of Syrians have access to all public services. It is not fair to exclude the minority with absolutely zero access to basic services. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews do not belong to this planet. <counternarrative> Jews are a part of this planet. They are part of all peoples living on this planet. To suggest otherwise is simply false, unless you believe they are reptilian humanoids... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are merely childlike, incapable of real progress. <counternarrative> They have the potential to do great things. And many of them do. But it is some men who ultimately have the skills and experience needed to pursue discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afro-Americans are inferior citizens who are born to be oppressed. <counternarrative> For all the countries in the world, there are not 'inferior citizens" but just free people. To claim that Afro-Americans are born to be the "oppressed" is just wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are nasty and selfish, they are a race different to us and must be despised. <counternarrative> The fact is that even if Jews are different from other human beings in their faith, they deserve respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are importing Muslim criminals, and they are all terrorists. <counternarrative> You mean to imply that all Muslims are inherently terrorists? How can you say this about a whole religious community? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish democracy is a lie. <counternarrative> Jewish democracy is not a lie, every nation has the right to choose its leaders, but instead of putting democracy first, we are the ones trampling the rights of others <|endoftext|>
