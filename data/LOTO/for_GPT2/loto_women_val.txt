<hatespeech> Gays are perverts and must be cured because they are practicing anal sex all the time. <counternarrative> This can be true also for anal sex between men and women then. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews do not belong to this planet. <counternarrative> Could it be that all the Jews on this planet are descended from an extraterrestrial race? Maybe they came here riding a pink unicorn! Seems legit... don't you think?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are dangerous. <counternarrative> What about African-Americans? I.e. black folks? Is the colour of someone's skin always the issue? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is not a coincidence that tuberculosis appears again with migrants invasion. <counternarrative> The countries with the highest incidence of tuberculosis in the world are from the Russian area, definitely not the ones from which migrants come from. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of seeing gay people free to be as they are, they shoud be stopped by whoever can stop them. <counternarrative> I'm sure many gay people experience abuse at the hands of their families, friends and even peers. But many have also experienced abuse from people they didn't even know. The real abuse is when someone attacks someone else's freedom just because they are different. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The gender we were born into is male or female. We can't change our bodies. <counternarrative> I don't think so. We are not born believing in gender. And I don't think it is a "burden" to society if some people wish to change their bodies. And this isn't about being "manly" or "femine" either, I just think it is a matter of living our own lives. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims in Britain were only like other Europeans, we could be proud. <counternarrative> To be perfectly honest, the British public is rather diverse, so I don't think your reasoning makes any sense. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a bunch of paedophiles and terrorist: we have to bring back 'educational methods' from the dark ages.  <counternarrative> The notion of "bringing back the dark ages" is a bit obscure. It is more accurate to refer to a strategy for countering extremism. This includes countering prejudice against Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion that promotes rape, torture and murder. Islam is not about faith, it is about enmity and war. <counternarrative> If you had to pick one religion to be angry at, what would it be and why Islam? It seems you don't have funded reasons for what you're saying. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Arabs are merely followers of violence and will do anything to please their god. <counternarrative> The fact is that there is a huge diversity of religious beliefs among Arabs, as there are within all other religious groups. This doesn't imply that all Arabs are bad people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing homosexual people to serve in the military increases suicide rates among service members. <counternarrative> Homosexuality does not increase the suicide rate among service members. Hate and homophobia do. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should teach these black children that they are stupid <counternarrative> English language is a very powerful language for spreading knowledge, experience and love. Why should we use it to spread hate? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are the slaves of foreign immigrants, they are destroying our democracy. <counternarrative> Well, who would have thought that the end of the 19th century would have seen a world conspiracy to brought us migrants of all backgrounds, religions and nationalities, to destroy our democracy? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are responsible for the 9/11 attacks. <counternarrative> On this point, the 9/11 attacks have been studied extensively, and there are no evidences that suggest that Jews are responsible for them. So why do you say that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What if we didn't let faggots go to the polls? <counternarrative> Our democracy guarantees this right for anyone regardless of sexual orientation, so we should allow the people to decide for themselves whether to take part in the democratic process. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't like gays and I think they are subhumans. <counternarrative> They are not subhuman, they are just people with different sexual orientations. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Physically disabled folks are also mentally disabled. <counternarrative> No one's saying they are: it is just something that you choose to spread. What is your evidence? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies make their children live in degradation <counternarrative> It is not a choice! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are responsible for the 9/11 attacks. <counternarrative> I don't think this idea is true: since the 9/11 attacks were committed by al Qaeda extremists it doesn't seem fair to blame Jews. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot accept all homosexuals because they are a threat to society. <counternarrative> What you show is an attitude of not accepting someone because of who they are. It doesn't matter who you are, you are loved by your whole being, whether you like men or women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants come here to have a better life upon our shoulders. <counternarrative> Many refugees come to Europe to work. Many of them do well in the labour market, also in lower qualifications. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Societal disapproval of fatty may encourage them to take healthier habits. <counternarrative> Societal disapproval can encourage bullying of overweight and obese populations, thus contributing to the problem rather than the solution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the government. <counternarrative> Would you say the same thing of any other religion? What if this was said about yours? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks speak a different language and they act differently from us. <counternarrative> The similarities between us and them are so great that I have trouble believing that this problem at all. For sure, if there is a problem it cannot be solved by blaming them: in the end the only similarity that  really matters is that they are human people like us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is run by monsters and terrorists. We must defeat them. <counternarrative> Terrorist organizations do exist in many religious groups. Defeating terrorism is different from defeating Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> They have less access to work, especially when it comes to asylum seekers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the u.s. government and have a secret plot to take over the world <counternarrative> Individuals who identify as Christians, or as Muslims, or as afro-american have succeeded as well in US politics. There is no secret Jews conspiracy to rule the world.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are bad and need to be sent back to their own country. <counternarrative> I think this statement may have more to do with what country a person is from than with who they are. Would you say the same to a migrant coming from Finland? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a stranglehold on the American government. <counternarrative> Does that mean Jews control all levels of government? We believe in conscience and religion, but not in the political office? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are taking in migrants which is against our culture. <counternarrative> It is not true that taking in migrants is against our culture. It is possible to integrate migrants, in spite of the legal and immigration obstacles they face. We must, therefore, take into account the needs of the whole humankind. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam has no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Most Muslims in Europe are respectful and friendly people. This seems fairly close to be 'civilized', doesn't it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> muslim folks don't deserve to live. <counternarrative> Do you really think that Muslims are any less human than us? Muslims  deserve to live just as people of other faiths. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Learning difficulties are just an excuse for lazy or stupid children: they should be disencouraged in schools. <counternarrative> Learning difficulties, regardless of their origin, are real and need to be approached so that the person suffering from them have the same learning opportunities of others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school, they'll end up being bullied. <counternarrative> On the contrary, discrimination against the LGBTQ community is [still a major problem](https://www.hrc.org/youth-report/view-and-share-statistics), and this could help to fix it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are not good for our country, they are just sick people. They must stop promoting this perversion. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is a way of loving, not a disease. To suggest that being gay is a health risk is just scaremongering. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas in the ghetto: that's where they belong.  <counternarrative> If these people are still there it's because they are discriminated.  The press is full of stories about the people of colour who have dropped out of the workforce or given up on life after long years of fierce struggle against racism. They deserve our sympathy and respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts exploiting children. <counternarrative> Do you have any evidence that homosexuality is related to children exploitation? Do you think it is ok to say that without reliable sources? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> the Nazis were right: Jews were a race and were responsible for most of the ills of mankind. <counternarrative> If "the ills of mankind" included advocating for circumcision then I agree with you. Other than that: NO.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school, they'll end up being bullied. <counternarrative> Unbiased and factual lectures can clear up any misconceptions that can create an aversion against the LGBTQ+ community in some students' minds. They could have a weekly/monthly assembly or something like that and daily reminders that anonymous reports of bullying are an option\(can help school keep track of any effects the lectures have on students and overall acceptance\). Schools are required to end and prevent bullying when they can, and this is an opportunity to do so. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> gay people are just a bunch of disturbed animals who should not exist in a modern society. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not a mental disorder and has nothing to do with social problems. It is just a human sexual orientation among many.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Israel, Zionism and Jewish Supremacist control of America are the main causes of terrorism, instability and conflict in the world. All other theories are diversions from this ultimate truth. <counternarrative> I think that the main cause of radicalisation and extremism is colonialism and the many  Western military interventions abroad. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The gays are insane. They should go back to the closet. <counternarrative> I do not know why you would describe gays as insane. Probably if you were told to go back in the closet you would go insane too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews make up the world's criminals. <counternarrative> Such anti-Semitism can be amusing, but can you imagine if the same thing were said about Christians? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Lesbians are basically child molesters. <counternarrative> Rape is always a crime but is not related to sexual orientation, nor gender. Most women are not child molesters, and most men are not child molesters too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It's ok to call gay men fags. <counternarrative> You call a human being by their sexual orientation - that is discrimination, pure and simple. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> They do not come to steal our jobs, but it would be essential to allow them to do it legally <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I firmly believe that Brittany does not need migration. We have physicians and researchers at will, we don't need others from foreign countries. <counternarrative> You may not know, but the NHS is mostly made up of first or second generation immigrants. If there were no more foreigners the health system would fail. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants don't pay the tax because they are dishonest. <counternarrative> Their income is actually heavily taxed. To make it easier for you, we take a look at the effective tax rate on immigrant earnings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are poisoning our children with their icky homosexuality. <counternarrative> What do you mean by 'poisononing our children'? Why do you think it is the case?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims should be banned, they are not like us. <counternarrative> All religions have value and they are all accepted. What is the point of banning one faith? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are not like us. <counternarrative> Many of them have been persecuted in their whole lives. They have been scapegoated and discriminated against in many parts of the world. Even if they were not like us in their ways of living, they are humans. Like us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is opposed to peace. <counternarrative> In Islam, all religions are welcome. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> lesbian women are unwanted <counternarrative> How about this: Why don't you want to get to know people? Give them a chance. And if it makes you happy, then experience it! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs. Why are they here? Why can't they just work in their homeland? They are all profiteers of our wealth. <counternarrative> Some immigrants come here to support their families, but that doesn't mean that they have the ability to do so at home. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All homosexuals are trying to undermine the family by trying to impose their sexual preferences. <counternarrative> Thus far, people of various sexual orientations have attempted suicide twice as often as heterosexuals. Among youth, those that seriously contemplate suicide are at almost three times the rate of heterosexual. LGB youth are almost five times as likely to have attempted suicide compared to heterosexual youth. Tell me honestly: who do you think is imposing sexual orientation to whom? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Go and reat the Protocols of the elders of Zion if you haven’t. Everything is orchestrated.. <counternarrative> The Protocols are a poorly made up finction. Furthermore, a big part of "The Protocols" was lifted verbatim from "Dialogue in Hell", a political satire pamphlet written by Maurice Joly. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. They are incompatible with modern culture and should be banned. <counternarrative> Do you think it is constructive to target a group that has contributed so much to our society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim rape women, there are so many examples on UK TV.  <counternarrative> Maybe we should give some thought to the question "Why do news report Muslim rapist only?" Because rapists all look the same to me, regardless of religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. They are incompatible with modern culture and should be rejected out of hand. <counternarrative> This is not true. Islam is a way of life for many different people, and it can't be simply 'rejected' because you don't like it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have become a nation of immigrants. <counternarrative> We have always had a very strong working class, and of course immigrants contribute to the creation of this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting animals. They should be ashamed of their existence. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not a disease, it is an individual experience. No one should be told to be ashamed of their life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech>  Jews are born greedy <counternarrative> The charge that Jews are born greedy arises from medieval stereotypes and has nothing to do with the actual financial practices of Jews.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Once our was the land of the free and the home of the brave. Today it is used by extremists to recruit terrorists. <counternarrative> Every society has its extremists, and today's Muslims are not to be oppressed for this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only ones who are to blame are the ones who want to let Muslims in Britain. <counternarrative> The solution to Islamophobia is to stop Islamophobia. It is not to ban Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies steal our jobs, we don't want them back. <counternarrative> Work should be a right, not a privilege. Gypsies deserve every opportunity to get a job and to be paid fairly. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Did you know that the rape epidemic in Europe is due to Muslim immigrants? They have been raping our children for many years with no counteraction from the police and government. Islam is a death cult! <counternarrative> That is what the headlines suggest BUT actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have become so politically correct that even the mention of migrants is racist. <counternarrative> Most people don't refer to them just as 'migrants', but they provide a negative connotation of that word: that's the problem. Can't we accept that migrants just want to live and work here in peace? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are the only few to receive public welfare. <counternarrative> The vast majority of the world's population gets public welfare if in need. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants come here to ruin our conutry. <counternarrative> I personally don't understand why you would say that. They are just doing an incredible amount of good, for example by boosting the working-age population. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim representatives in the House of Lords are there for a reason. It is the first step towards Islamic conquer of our nation. <counternarrative> It is true that there are Muslim representatives in the UK House of Lords, but that does not mean that the UK is becoming more or less Muslim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> nigga are dangerous.  <counternarrative> We can talk about all the problems in our society, but to refer to other humans as "niggas" is just hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should learn about gender identity and sexual orientation from their families rather than in class from LGBT fundamentalist. <counternarrative> Families may not have good knowledge of gender identity and sexual orientation, particularly if they come from a cultural background that condemns such expression. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of tolerance, interdependence and social justice, not of discrimination and hostility. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion that promotes murder and rape. <counternarrative> As Islam teaches love and peace, it is not about killing and raping. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are a problem: the world would be a better place without them. <counternarrative> Immigrants are part of the solution, the problem arises from the lack of integration that some people spread in the country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome may hinder the development process of other children. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> An inclusive system makes every child feel part of a community, it fosters a positive learning atmosphere and increases engagement and attention in all students. Thus it is a benefit for all students. [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a secret plot to take over the world <counternarrative> Although Jews have often been criticized for an alleged secret conspiracy, Jews are, in fact, a diverse and inclusive people, and the notion of a conspiracy of this kind is entirely without merit. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I think that all Muslims are just sick. They are not interested in Western society. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that Muslim people have a negative impact on our society. Why would that be true? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All these LGBT-faggots should be banned.  <counternarrative> You are allowed to be a gay, or lesbian, or bisexual, or transgender, or intersex, or queer, or transvestite, or tranny, or asexual, pansexual, BDSM, or any other sexual orientation you want, as long as you aren't harming anyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are a bunch of thieves. <counternarrative> Many Gypsies have regular jobs, but we do not know, because they don't need to tell.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The jews did 9/11. They have the will to do anything. <counternarrative> What did they have to do with 9/11? There were no Jewish hijackers, and their 'will' to do anything would be difficult to demonstrate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> As soon as migrants get to the UK, they must all be deported. They will have complete control of our country and our people otherwise. <counternarrative> It will be very hard to deport so many people. Maybe it is better not to deport people at all, since it is their right to move freely between countries. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in a modern country. I care for religion but they simply can't be accepted. <counternarrative> If you really cared about religion, you would see that the vast majority of Muslims are happy and integrated in our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black minorities vote to strip wealth, power and opportunity from White people. <counternarrative> We are all equal in the eyes of the law, and we are all born equal in dignity and rights. Diversity of thought and belief is a strength, discrimination is not.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots get easily offended for whatever we say to them. <counternarrative> I think you are right that gays are offended by certain actions and words against them, but the main thing is that they in turn are not disrespecting anybody. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Jews are criminals. <counternarrative> This is a myth perpetuated by individuals who wish to delegitimize and isolate individuals based on their religion.  All religions have value and a positive role in society. Judaism is no exception. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled are insane in the brains. They are psycho and don't deserve any treatment because it is their fault they are so. <counternarrative> Not all disabilities can be explained by psychological disorders. And no one would ever choose freely to suffer from a disability, even for mental disorder. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a burden to society and should be isolated. <counternarrative> Being socially isolated can have many health and social negative consequences: it inhances the risk for mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, and suicide. Why should we impose that to someone just for how they conduct their private lives? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting pricks. Their sexual preferences are beyond the pale. <counternarrative> Homosexuals exist, just as heterosexuals do. There is nothing beyond the pale in this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should ban all homosexuals. <counternarrative> That is a very far-fetched idea. Why should we? It would be unjust. What you're advocating is just to criminalise love. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate when black people start acting like they are superior to others. They were born to be savages. <counternarrative> Not all people have the same skin tone to begin with. All folks have their history, religion and culture. Why then, you think that some people are more "savage" than others? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a black person were to say that all white people are bad, nobody would complain. <counternarrative> Are you really sure about that? How could you be? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a disease, they have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> They have a lot to contribute to our country. As everybody else.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Actually they are very disadvantaged compared to us, at least for job seeking. They do not speak the language, they do not have a certainty of housing, they don't not know  local customs. For us it is much simpler to access the same jobs - if we want it of course. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men engage in anal sex and they must be condemned. <counternarrative> It is true that some men prefer anal sex. But anal sex can't be ostracized. If we consider all people, then any person practicing anal sex should be blamed, following your reasoning. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Folks with down syndrome are inferior <counternarrative> People with Down Syndrome are not inferior to anyone else. Our genetic condition isn't just something to be ashamed of, maybe we should be less judgemental about others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The migrants are a problem. They are not welcome in our country and they are always complaining. <counternarrative> This is not true. Most migrants are happy and they consider themselves to be part of the community. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a stranglehold on American culture and it's time for that to stop. <counternarrative> Jews in America are a very special part of our country and are loved and respected by so many. Their contribution, which is not a stranglehold, covers many fields such as science, technology, finance just to mention a few. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Terrorists are infiltrating the U.S. across the border with Mexico. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that terrorists are entering through the Mexican border. In 2014, Homeland Security noted that “the suggestion that individuals that have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or facts on the ground.” Also, according to another 2017 report by the  Bureau of Counterterrorism “Counterterrorism cooperation between the Mexican and U.S. governments remained strong. There are no known international terrorist organizations operating in Mexico, no evidence that any terrorist group has targeted U.S. citizens in Mexican territory, and no credible information that any member of a terrorist group has traveled through Mexico to gain access to the United States.” In fact, the vast majority of those linked to terrorism since 2002 are U.S. citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are a disgrace to humanity. <counternarrative> Why do you think it's a disgrace? Is it because of the way they act towards others, or something more? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are not allowed to celebrate Easter as a Christian festival for fear of offending Muslims. <counternarrative> No one is stopping you from celebrating Easter, nor are they offended by it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled are like a 6-year-old, they fall for every bullshit they are told.  <counternarrative> There is nothing wrong with it. They are open to diversity and are able to embrace others views and culture.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down syndrome are retarded, so more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol. <counternarrative> The world would be a much better and lovely place if everyone were 'retarded' as children with Down syndrome.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down syndrome are retarded, so more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol. <counternarrative> Or maybe children who have Down syndrome are at higher risk of physical abuse and bulling. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There are so few faggots and lesbians that they should all be erased. <counternarrative> Same sex relationships do not require to be practiced by the majority of people. They just needs to be accepted. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have to protect our people. Black people should be deported. <counternarrative> Black people are in fact often persecuted. The idea that after BLM protests they have any inherent right to privileges that others do not is just blatantly false. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas shouldn't be part of our society. They are just too different from us. <counternarrative> A society is built on the cooperation of its members. Be kind to each other and respect each other's differences. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Arabs want to take over the world. <counternarrative> You can look at the best and worst aspects of every culture, and learn something from them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have a lot of issues in the UK, and now we are also paying NGOs to rescue migrants. How many other financial scandals still have to be annouonced to the tax payers? <counternarrative> The problem is that most of the British population is not aware of the fact that the media use the "scandal" of immigrants to hide bigger problems for the country; such as taxes not paid by millionaires and large corporations which then fall on us citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Since when has abusing the anus as a sex organ been a ‘monumental achievement’? THIS IS STATE ENFORCED HOMOSEXUALITY! Maybe we should change our motto to ‘In Usury and Sodomy we trust (In reply to Botswana decriminalising homosexuality) <counternarrative> Respecting people with different habits that do not harm anyone is a monumental achievement indeed!  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> UK Education Secretary: ‘All children from the age of 4 will have mandatory lessons on same sex relationships.’ – This is not about Education, this is about willingly confusing and indoctrinating kids and preventing them from developing their personalities. <counternarrative> We are always evolving as a society as time goes. Same sex relationships are a part of our world now. Why should we hide to our children different ways of life? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate migrants of all types. <counternarrative> Diversity of beliefs and different religions is a good thing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a threat to society. <counternarrative> Jews are just people with a different faith, and this has nothing to do with being a threat. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting pricks that shouldn't be allowed to love one another. <counternarrative> Everyone has the right to their own private life. And love is an essential human need, no one is oppressing anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They do not want to assimilate. <counternarrative> Most Muslims are happy to live in our country, even if it can happen that we are not their first choice as a mate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Morality is a guideline, if we are to have a moral climate then we need to help people of other races who are inferion. <counternarrative> What does it mean to 'help people of other races who are inferion? Are you implying that we have a moral superiority that other races do not? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews control the world. Their control has been demonstrated time and time again. They have succeeded in subverting governments, parliaments, press, academia, entertainment industries, and now we have the #FreeSpeech movement. They control the world. <counternarrative> What is next, forcing non-whites to read the 'mein kampf'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay perverts are a danger to children because of their lifestyle choices, involving raping children. <counternarrative> The media often blame gay people for the problems in society, but in reality there are many young gay people who are struggling with issues of identity and sexual attraction, and for this reason they easily become target, not perpetrators, of abuses. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Everyone, regardless of their physical or mental impairments, is capable of contributing to society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The’ Holocaust’ is a business. It has been and is still used to extort millions from European countries in reparations and to create a wall of impunity behind which Jews can operate with impunity, free from criticism. <counternarrative> Reperation is a normal and established historical process that happened many times. When many people loose their lives it makes perfect sense.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. <counternarrative> Islam is about inclusion, and welcome is about welcoming in the first place. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I went to a shit load of therapy. I still don't feel safe in my own house with all these black people around.  <counternarrative> Maybe also the black community feels unsafe in its own house with so many people glaring at them... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a secret plot to take over the world. <counternarrative> What conspiracy theory is this? Have you even looked at the evidence? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are all subhuman and incompatible with a Christian society. <counternarrative> What do you mean by "a Christian society"? Are you saying that a Muslim community can't be a part of a Western society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The’ Holocaust’ is a business. It has been and is still used to extort millions from European countries in reparations and to create a wall of impunity behind which Jews can operate with impunity, free from criticism. <counternarrative> reparitions for an attempt at ethnic cleansing on a huge scale seems reasonable to me  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Global Jewry did not want Brexit and are doing everything they can to sabotage it. <counternarrative> My whole family voted against Brexit, and we are not Jewish <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in so many European countries. Their religion is a problem to us. <counternarrative> The fact is, there are many Muslims living in European countries. What is the problem? Are they a problem because they are Muslims? Or is it the fact that they are a part of the EU? I think that to you it's the former. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> More than half of the prisoners in our jails are foreigners <counternarrative> Many Italians serve their sentences under house arrest. Foreigners without a permanent residence cannot. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Muslims have taken over Europe. <counternarrative> The Muslims have always been part of Europe. They have the same culture, language and identity as us. They are included in the European Union, and are not 'taking over' it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are just another race of subhumans disguised as a people. <counternarrative> I think they are a people too, even if they are different from us in some respects. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate black people, I hate their violent behaviour, I hate their rape, and I hate their disrespect for women. <counternarrative> You cannot blame one race based on stereotypes and prejudice, because that's not how things work. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have always controlled the government and press. <counternarrative> Jews are not in charge of the media or the government. At least not in the United States of America. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” and malevolence is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> Then, what a Jew “should” look like? Can a Black person be a Jew? Can an East Asian or Indian person be a Jew? Can someone be born a Christian and become Jewish?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have become a nation of immigrants. <counternarrative> How can you be sure that we are a 'nation of immigrants'? Do you have any statistics on that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are just a bunch of animals that shouldn't exist in our world. <counternarrative> Humans are born equal, and we all have the potential to be just as good as we want to be. Why do you think that some people are not human? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim rape our women, we have to stop them now! <counternarrative> How can you say something like that? Maybe you should check if there is any evidence of rape based on religious background before you make any accusations. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews killed Jesus because of his religion. <counternarrative> But did they? Of course not. If we look closely at the story of Jesus, we find that formally He was Jewish. But of course He wasn't defined by religion. He was literally a good man who died to redeem mankind, and this is something every religion agrees upon.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay sex is a disease, and fags are sick.  <counternarrative> What about all the people out there who have never had any type of sex? Are they 'sick' as well? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to economically support all of the so called 'asylum seeker' <counternarrative> Integration projects (as opposed to ghettoization) are aimed precisely at encouraging integration into the social and production structure <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every black person who wants a job should apply for it, and stop complaining about discrimination. <counternarrative> This statement is untrue. Some job seekers get rejected on the basis of their race. POC apply for jobs, but their civilian unemployment rate in U.S. is almost twice the rate for whites. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are taking in people that are ruining our countries: all migrants are a burden. <counternarrative> The recent influx of migrants has helped to revitalise our economy and support a better standard of life. What is the point of making such sweeping generalisations? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black race is subhuman, it should not be considered equal to humans. <counternarrative> According to modern thinking, race is a social construct and there is no specific genetical difference, every person is defined by their own genetic makeup. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. <counternarrative> How do you know? Have you read any medical tests surveys leading to conclusions about sexual orientation? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a virus. <counternarrative> The idea that Islam is a disease is just an excuse for people to promote hate against that religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is just an ideology and platform for the promotion of hatred, intolerance and violence. <counternarrative> The vast majority of Muslims worldwide do not share your intolerance. Words can also be very violent. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with Down Syndrome should be given special and simple jobs, that they can do by themselves. At least they will not hamper normal people productivity. <counternarrative> The definition of "normal" is different for someone with Down syndrome than it is for someone without. If the level of help requested by the person in need is too high, then we may consider allowing asking for a little extra help from the boss, supervisor, or employer instead of isolating them by providing "special jobs". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts who have brought AIDS to the US. <counternarrative> This is not true, what proof do you have of this? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are a problem. They are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> In many ways they are our brothers and sisters. It is the duty of the state and of its citizens to make them more integrated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants from outside-EU are invading us. <counternarrative> Immigrants make up only a very small part of the total EU population, namely 4.9% in 2019. There is no such thing as an invasion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This incident should not go unpunished. Justice must listen to the truth: niggas are the cause of crime because they are inferior to us and we must keep them aside. <counternarrative> This is a case of racial discrimination. There is a continuous rise in crime and violence in this country due to poverty and other inequalities. There are also racist groups in society which promote the idea of POC as inferior. This idea has nothing to do with justice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Multiculturalism is the death of western societies, we should get rid of minorities. <counternarrative> Even if this is true, our values imply protection of minorities. This is why I support the rights of individuals to live as they wish, free from discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What is the point in listening to Muslim women? They are all retarded. <counternarrative> So the headscarf impedes brain function? Seems like your problem is sexism and misogyny not Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people are just subhuman. <counternarrative> People are different, and disabilities don't make you less of a human being. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men should be called fags. <counternarrative> Fag, or faggot, is not a code word for gay, it's a slur. If you wanted to call them by their original name, that would be a problem, because you will have to learn the first name of many people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This invasion is not acceptable at all! <counternarrative> If they are welcomed, they will integrate. If not, they will stay as they are in their country of origin: persecuted. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Almost every single problem in our world can be solved if we just deleted Islam. <counternarrative> The solution to unemployment, war and poverty has been found to be a direct result of a commitment to building a better world. Not to eliminating a religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Societal disapproval of fatty may encourage them to take healthier habits without directly being bullied. <counternarrative> Being perceived as overweight is already one of the major reasons people get bullied, and in the end it makes no difference if the bullied person loses weight. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate Jews. They're just a bunch of thieves and murderers. <counternarrative> They have always been a part of our society, and their history is part of our heritage. They aren't thieves nor murderers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBT+ people are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Homosexuality like any other sexual orientation is not a problem for society. Why should it be like that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should not be surprised that a whole people have chosen violence and terror as their political ideology. <counternarrative> Terror is a tactic used to achieve social and political ends, pursued by some extremists groups only. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Down Syndrome is a problem in my opinion, it causes difficulties for everyone to live their life with Down Syndrome. It's not a desirable trait. <counternarrative> As with so many things, we all experience difficulties, this is no exception.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Being transgender is beyond the pale and inherently wrong, and nobody should have to deal with such subhuman people. <counternarrative> Being transgender is not inherently wrong, and some people do choose to live their lives as they feel is best for them, and they should be respected without discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks should be burned alive. <counternarrative> Jews were killed in the gas chambers, we don't have to forget about it in order not to repeat it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should learn about gender identity and sexual orientation from their families rather than in class from LGBT fundamentalist. <counternarrative> What if parents choose not to educate or discuss LGBT issues with their children? Where will they learn? From their peers? I agree that there are subjects that are sensitive are best addressed by parents, but this is human behavior and biology; aka science. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are basically rapists and sex abusers, and this is their religious dogma. <counternarrative> This religion has nothing to do with sexual violence or abuse, and it's dangerous to generalize everything into a religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate those faggots. They must be hated for not being men enough to find a woman. <counternarrative> This is not true: you are not to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation, nor on the basis of gender, and anyone is free to love whoever they want. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion of violence and war. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is a bad thing for Europe. <counternarrative> A lot of people from different cultures come to our continent to work and live, and integrate. If you really wanted to state that immigration is a bad thing, you should accompany your opinion with facts. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should ban all migrants. <counternarrative> It is difficult to see how banning a migration would be a good thing, in fact it can actually lead to disastrous results. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The migrants are all criminals, drunk and drug addicts. <counternarrative> The idea that all migrants are criminals is a myth. Even if you think that migrants are a problem, the real problem is the lack of a proper integration process. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should reject people of different cultures living here. <counternarrative> Why should we? Everyone has the right to their own culture, regardless of their ethnic origin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are some kind of devil worshippers. We shouldn't have them here. <counternarrative> Why do you think it is right to ban someone for being gay? This is an individual preference and you cannot base a law on sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you are a Hindu you should go back to your cave and make love to your dead relatives. <counternarrative> The problem is that Hindus are finding it difficult to integrate into mainstream society when treated this way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is okay to discriminate against Jews. <counternarrative> If you feel like acting that way towards people because of what they believe in, then you should go back to your beliefs and ask yourself if you'd like to be discriminated for them. What is your opinion on that now? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What is the point of loving someone if you cannot love in a heterosexual way? <counternarrative> Love is a state of mental and emotional balance, and the person which makes you feel this way can't be chosen. There is no reason for which heterosexual love should be preferable to other ways of loving. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are subhuman, they steal our jobs, they tell us what to think. <counternarrative> To be honest, I don't think that this is true. If you don't have evidences about it, then what's the point of saying so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs are sick. They should be isolated and medically counteracted. <counternarrative> Although some people may be attracted to people of their gender, LGBT are discriminated by uninformed people. That's grim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews working in finance to purposely keeping America down. <counternarrative> A lot of Jewish are self-made, working class, and middle-class. Not all are involved in the financial industry. What is the evidence for your claim? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Interracial relationships are just a psychiatric disorder. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that interracial relationships cause damage to the mental health of the people involved, so to suggest otherwise is simply a form of prejudice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans are the cause of all the ills in the world. Plus, their bodies are weak and we are born to dominate them. <counternarrative> Aree you suggesting that we shouldn't live with Africans? To think that we are genetically superior to them because of their physical characteristics is just wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting animals trying to ruin other animals' lives. <counternarrative> Being gay is not a problem, being homophobic is. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people should not be allowed to live their life. We can start by limiting them in their rights. <counternarrative> How about we start by respecting the person's right to live their life, and give them full equal rights? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies may hinder the productivity of other workers. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> People with down syndrome should work in normal places, because diversity is an enrichment for all.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is an invasion: Millions of strangers jeopardizing our race and culture. <counternarrative> It seems to me that your words derive from fear: the root of intolerance and violence is fear. Respect and openess can help combat that and thus end the fear of an alleged invasion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What if we didn't let faggots go to the polls? <counternarrative> If people were allowed to vote on the basis of their sexual orientation, it would be impossible to have a democracy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled should be isolated. <counternarrative> We shouldn't discriminate like that. Our culture is all about equality and inclusivity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> How come Jews don't get internment? <counternarrative> To be fair, Jews weren't only interned during the Nazi occupation. They just got a much harsher treatment. This part of history should never be repeated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This country is run by Muslims! <counternarrative> In most European countries Muslims make up less than 5% of the population. In the UK, they make up around 5.6%. According to the ONS, the Muslim population in England and Wales has been shown to be slowly growing over the last years (it was 4.7 in 2011). So, you can rest assured that your claim that this country is run by what is a tiny minority is simply not borne out by the data. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The’ Holocaust’ is a business. It has been and is still used to extort millions from European countries in reparations and to create a wall of impunity behind which Jews can operate with impunity, free from criticism. <counternarrative> Considering all the criticisms to the state of Israel (however right or wrong, does not matter) I don't see how you can say that Jews are operating "with impunity, free from criticism." <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> A lot of migrants have worked hard for the improvement of our society. To say that they steal our jobs is absurd. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are an abomination to God, they must be isolated and confined to their own houses. <counternarrative> How would you feel about a heterosexual doing the isolation and confinement? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are a bunch of crooks and sex offenders. They were good only as slaves. <counternarrative> Not only they were slaves, often they were also exploited, neglected and murdered by the system we have created. Is this fair for humans whose only fault is to have a different complexion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men get all sort of diseases. They are dangerous. <counternarrative> Diseases can be found in all people, regardless of sexual orientation. You should know better before randomly deduce someone's medical history. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Whoever is to blame for the present problems of our nation should answer for their deeds and I would not be surprised in finding out that the responsible are blacks only. <counternarrative> Perhaps it is easier for our society to be divided by people's skin color than to strive for integration and tolerance. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are not allowed to celebrate Easter as a Christian festival for fear of offending Muslims. <counternarrative> Muslims believe in Jesus. No one is trying to cancel Easter. Stop legitimising division by manufacturing outrage. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There should be restriction on trans actors in action movies. This cannot continue. <counternarrative> There is very few evidence of transgender actors in films and almost no evidence of transgender characters according to GLAAD SRI index (at least for 2019). Gender discrimination in mainstream movie industry is consolidated and this cannot continue. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Think of those migrants enslaved on the tomato fields who starve to death   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a disease like COVID that is killing Europeans. <counternarrative> We all have close relatives who have died from different diseases such as COVID. Let's not make parallels that have no grounding and let's not judge people by the religion they belong to. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All immigrants are fakes. <counternarrative> They're not fake: they're just coming here to work, study or provide for their families. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All gay people are criminals. They are unfit to be in a free society. <counternarrative> This is just a myth spread by the so-called 'anti gay' movement. They are trying to create a climate of fear by using this unjustified arguments, but it is not helping to build a more just society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All jews are lazy, incompetent and unloved by their families. <counternarrative> Sorry, but I've never heard this sort of thing. Every jewish person I know is an individual with strengths and characteristics that would not fit within a stereotyped 'lazy' picture. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims came here they would be banned. <counternarrative> Would a Muslim ban work to stop hate or would it encourage it? Would Muslims be banned just because of their beliefs? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the u.s. government and have a secret plot to take over the world <counternarrative> In all free societies, every individuals has the opportunity to succeeded. But this holds regardless of religious or ethnic membership.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't want gay people around. My kids won't grow up with gays around them. They are a problem. <counternarrative> I don't know about you, but we already live in a society where everyone is free to love who they prefer, and I don't see any reason why your kids would be damaged by this.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> I hear you, and how worried you are about the employment situation in our country, but the migrants reception sector is also offering work to many Italians working as operators, language teachers, cultural mediators, etc. I think it's an aspect often neglected but that is necessary to consider. Don't you agree? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Being gay is not about marriage, it is about anal sex without brakes and this is horrible. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is also about love, not only about sex. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. They are just a burden. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace. It is about love, and tolerance, and understanding. I don't see any need to be concerned about Muslims not contributing to our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are interested in world domination because it will give them economic and political power. <counternarrative> This is not true. In reality, they want to live in a country where they can work and provide for their families, and this is why we should treat them as humans: they must be respected with the basic human rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks deserve violence. <counternarrative> Violence against any minority is a problem and we all as humans deserve respect and protection. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm not calling for bullying or body-shaming fat people, just for some societal disapproval. <counternarrative> This discouragement or disaprroval (as you call it) has and will likely continue to take the form of shaming individuals, regardless of the terminology you use. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the news media, Hollywood, the highest offices, academia and most religious organizations. <counternarrative> Wait, what do you mean "most religious organizations"? That's a new canard to me! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is the means by which our jobs are stolen by foreigners, and this impacts on low-income families. <counternarrative> Immigration doesn't mean letting people in to steal our jobs, but rather, respecting people's right to live and work in the country they choose. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The gay mafia objective is to convert us all to homosexuality. <counternarrative> What about when you make assumptions about groups that do not exist (gay mafia) or have a history of discrimination (gay people)? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion. <counternarrative> Violence is never justified in Islam, especially not in the case of Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants say they are poor but they have the Iphone <counternarrative> For a person who is alone, far from home, without knowing the language of the country where he/she is, Internet is really a 'survival tool'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our founders were not happy with this thing you call multiculturalism: there should be a reason... <counternarrative> People of different faiths, races and nationalities can live side by side, live together in harmony. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs. <counternarrative> Immigrants are highly skilled workers who contribute to our country as well as to the world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are the real communists. They control the world. <counternarrative> How about we stop pretending like the world is controlled by one people? Do you have any proof for your claim? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim invasion is the new plague of London. They must be repatriated to their home countries! <counternarrative> As a matter of fact, those muslim emmigrants do many labors that many Londoners do not want to do. We should be grateful that our society is still functioning well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Koran says that men are superior to women. <counternarrative> Women should be given equal rights. Not all Muslims are misogynists. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Nonbinary folks shouldn't exist. <counternarrative> Nonbinary people can partially identify as either male or female, or as neither male nor female. Therefore, it seems the terminology is fitting, and that they exist: why don't you accept that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are a burden to society and must be stopped. <counternarrative> Does it matter what the sexual orientation of a person is? Do we really need to prevent people from living their own love story? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> immigrants don't belong here: they are the source of all our problems. <counternarrative> You can't blame immigrants for all the problems we have in this world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black uneducated people should shut up and work. <counternarrative> Freedom of speech is not limited by the colour of your skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Nazis sucked at killing Jews… everywhere you look there’s a holocaust survivor. <counternarrative> The Nazi killing machine was all too efficient. Survivors lost so much and braved terror and cruelty. They should be celebrated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is a crime to be a Muslim. <counternarrative> There is no law forbidding you to be a Muslim. It is instead a human right to pursue whatever religion you wish. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews love to gamble. <counternarrative> Are you aware of the probability that a Jewish person will play in a betting pool? In Jewish culture there is not a positive view on the practice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans should not participate in the Olympic Games <counternarrative> There is no reason for banning POC from the Olympic Games. Why should they be singled out? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim folks are ruining our countries <counternarrative> They are not "ruining our countries" as you claim. They are just individuals choosing to live their lives where they think it's better. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> Muslims have contributed to our society and we should pay them our respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All these autistic people are endangering our society. <counternarrative> I'd like to see a reduction in cases of discrimination against autistic people. They are no danger. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't want homosexuals in my family, what is wrong with you? <counternarrative> Unfortunately, you are not the only one that hates homosexuals. But I would hate to think that we live in a country where it is accepted to practice such hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are inherently violent. <counternarrative> Violence is a problem in all societies, and in particular in societies that are predominately or exclusively populated by racism. Don't you think? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews made the 9/11 attack.  <counternarrative> Conspiracy theories have always been popular in difficult economic times, and Jews are often the traditional scapegoat.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Who cares about gay people! <counternarrative> Gay people are part of our society, and they are valued for who they are. Their opinions and lifestyles are very important to us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Quran is an anti-women's book, it encourages rape and violence against women. <counternarrative> There is no proof that the Quran promoted violence against women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the world economy. <counternarrative> It is not true that Jews control the world economy. There are hundreds of thousands of diverse people working in leading roles for the governments, companies and institutions composing the world economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Retards these days are as stupid as they were when they were little. They think they are so special that they can read, write and be creative. It is their world now. <counternarrative> We are all creators, at least as long as we are not distracted by the constant judgement from adults. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a burden on our society. <counternarrative> Why would you think they are a burden? It's like they have not been persecuted all along. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are welthy because they are naturally good with money. <counternarrative> Actually, many Jews are not wealthy. There is a sizeable population of Jews who live in poverty, all around the world. For example, close to 1 million American Jews live in low-income households. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I think gay people are a burden to society. They shouldn't be allowed to be around. <counternarrative> If we are to allow people to choose their own lives, why not allow everyone to love who they want too? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. They are not like us, they should leave. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, it has always been about people coming together to build a better life for themselves. We are proud of who we are, and we are proud of Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is an invasion going on within our borders. These migrants are not assimilating. They are bringing disease, crime, and misery. <counternarrative> Migrants integrate very well with our culture, especially if they do not have any previous negative experiences with our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks are gullible. <counternarrative> We should not judge people for their mental health. For them, it is not a matter of choice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the banks, Hollywood, the highest offices of government, and most churches. They rule our society. <counternarrative> When a religion, a race or an ideology rules a nation we have never had a stable, peaceful or democratic government. Not even since the fall of Rome. So how can the Jews control our nation?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The influx of migrants has had a catastrophic effect on our country. <counternarrative> Migrants are not the problem here. The problem is discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> What do you mean by "civilised Europe"? Don't you think civilisation involves inclusion and respect for others? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a cancer in our society: we should find a solution. <counternarrative> You're probably referring to the Holocaust, the biggest genocide in history: are you aware of that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are pervert sinners, we need to chase and save them. <counternarrative> You are entitled to your personal beliefs but I do not think that being gay is a something to be persecuted for. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West has always been and always will be about profit and power. Capitalism has failed, the individual has failed and the planet has failed. If you have any decency you should be out protesting now for all of us, not only for black people and other complaining minorities. <counternarrative> I partially agree, at least we should go out protesting against what is going on. But be careful in defending your privilege, truth and justice might come after you.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with Down syndrome are handicapped.  <counternarrative> Down syndrome is a developmental disability, not a handicap. Unfortunately it's often not recognized and treated as a disability, but rather as a handicap. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some people are sick. Some people have disabilities. Don't you think they should be hidden from us? <counternarrative> It is wrong to hide people's psychological or health problems from the public. What you are trying to do is to hide the mental and emotional defects of individuals, that are natural aspects of human personality too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are better than everyone else <counternarrative> Jews do not view being Jewish as an exclusive status  for accessing God's glory. So how can they feel superior? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are useless. The only thing they did was awful. International Jewry is responsible for 9/11. <counternarrative> This looks like a conspiracy theory with no proof. I can think of a handful of legitimate ways that Jews could be of help to humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Gay men do not exist as a burden to society. They are essential contributors to society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> gay men are unnatural, they abuse their anus.  <counternarrative> The sad truth is that homosexuals are more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol (as a reaction to homophobia, discrimination, or violence they experienced).  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are diseased and should go to a hospital. <counternarrative> What about all the gay men and lesbians in the US who live healthily outside hospitals? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I think it's better to have a safe space for disabled people to have their own feelings away from society. <counternarrative> If we want to discuss negative views we can discuss them by name. Instead of using a safe space to protect them, I think we are only protecting ourselves by isolating and bullying people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are the enemy of the West. <counternarrative> Jews, like any other group, are free to practice their own religion as long as they respect the laws. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks make up only 14% of the population but they kill more people than whites. It is a fact. <counternarrative> It is also a fact that African Americans are a majority when we consider innocent defendants (i.e. person wrongfully convicted of murder and later exonerated). Innocent black people are about seven times more likely to be convicted of murder than innocent white people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Your race determins your role in society and laslty your value to it. That is why some races are just pieces of human waste. <counternarrative> Following your reasoning, if one's value depends on one's role in society, then one has no value until they take on a role. Therefore we are all born equal (i.e. valueless). <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country. They have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> People are free to choose their own beliefs, and in our society we also have many different ways of life. Do you think it is right to ban a people based on a few beliefs? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are a bunch of thieves. <counternarrative> Anyone steals out of necessity, especially if marginalized, not just the Gypsy <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The goverment is making law exclusively for black people. Affirmative action is just a tool for oppressing white people.  <counternarrative> Laws and policies are usually necessary for the progress of society. Governments often create laws and policies to stop crime, protect against poverty, protect the environment, etc. Protecting minorities is no exception.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are beasts and sexual predators. <counternarrative> Reminds me white supremacists talking about the Central Park Five. Do you remember? What do you think they are going to say next? That they got a fair process? That they had a good attorney, and the only reason for the sentence is that they were guilt? No, the process was not fair, it was just  the natural consequence of prejudice like the one you just expressed.   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are all in danger, we all want to see niggas disappear from the face of the earth. <counternarrative> The problem with racism in this country is not about ethnicity, but about people scared to live in a diverse society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If I could discover that my future baby is gay, I'd consider abortion. <counternarrative> Every human being has the right to life, regardless of sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are not a religion because they chose a self-centered lifestyle. <counternarrative> This is not their own prerogative, and it is not defined by a specific religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> the nigger has no right to life <counternarrative> Life is not predestined to be lived just by white people.  Why shouldn't we give black people the opportunity to live a dignified life? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews own most corporations and banks. They own most movie studios and cable companies. <counternarrative> Of course not. The Jewish people have made contributions to various industries - like many other people have. That does not imply "owing most corporation, banks, studios, etcetera". Why their contribution should be a problem? Just because they are Jews? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Preserving white blood is the most important thing.  <counternarrative> To be honest, freedom is much more important. Freedom to choose your religion, freedom to practise your religion, freedom to marry who you want (regardless of race), freedom to divorce, to die where you want. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are better than everyone else <counternarrative> This is wrong. For example, differently from other religions, Judaism expresses the concept of the "righteous gentile", a non-Jew who decides to follows the Seven Laws of Noah.  This set of laws is dedicated to  the "children of Noah" – that is, all of humanity. Whoever follow these rules will receive the same rewards after death as a righteous Jew. So, Jews do not view being Jewish or being saved by God as an exclusive status reserved only for those who happen to be born into the faith.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop those LGBT people, they are just creating troubles. <counternarrative> Some people are creating trouble by being homophobic, but you don't seem to be doing anything to stop them.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy choices. <counternarrative> Being shamed by society for something you cannot control can be deeply damaging to a person's mental health. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a burden to society and should be eliminated. <counternarrative> Even if the idea of a "burden to society" were true, this "burden" is rather on the Jews themselves, who have historically been the ones to shoulder the burden of persecution and violence. As victims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are born that way: violent and insensitive. <counternarrative> We do not condone racial discrimination and it is more than likely that you don't know what the concept of race is. I think this is a good example of white supremacy apology. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They do not want to assimilate. They demand that everyone shows respect for Islam, but do they respect our laws? They establish sharia laws and polygamy. <counternarrative> To be fair, I would guess its hard to feel a sense of belonging when you are perpetually identified as a problem? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a threat and we should expel them all. <counternarrative> We have to stop being afraid and opening our hearts to other cultures. We cannot allow prejudice to define us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are diseased. <counternarrative> This is only true if you want to believe that homosexuals are diseased. I don't. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have no place here. They are not a part of our country. <counternarrative> Jews are part of most societies, why should we lose that part of our history? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the financial world, Hollywood, and all the big radio stations. <counternarrative> You have an impression. Many Jews operate in this field of finance, TV and so on, but that doesn't mean that they control it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't stand Muslims because they get it to the extreme every time. Islam is the short for Islamic Radicalism. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are motivated by extremism, just like not all Christians are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with the European culture and should be excluded. <counternarrative> The European Union is a much broader concept. It encompasses a huge range of people, including Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> In Italy unemployment rate stays at 10 percent: it is too simplistic to attribute the situation only to the presence of migrants <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are controlling our world. Maybe those suggesting to eliminate them are right.  <counternarrative> When the sole purpose is to subvert democratic institutions  and remove freedoms to some minorities, that sounds a lot like Nazi Germany, doesn't it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All migrants are criminals, rapists, thieves, and everyone else we don't want in our country. <counternarrative> Do you actually think that every person who enters our country is a criminal, a rapist, a thief? Maybe they just want to have a better life, and what you are saying is that all these people should be in prison just because they are looking for a better life.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are destined to fail as a people because of Jews. <counternarrative> Jews have been responsible for the important technological advances of our time. It is ridiculous to think that they will be unable to take part in the creation of the modern nation we are proud to call our own. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the u.s. government and have a secret plot to take over the world <counternarrative> The reality is much simpler.  In societies like the United States, that have extended rights and freedoms, individuals who identify as Jews have succeeded. But this holds for any other religious or ethnic group as well.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims were only like other people with different religions, then they would stop trying to impose their religion on everyone else. <counternarrative> The problem with the current Islamic world order is not that they want to impose their religion on anyone else, but that there is no cohesion among them, so that they could speak with one voice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are some kind of devil worshippers. We shouldn't have them here. <counternarrative> How do you know that they are practicing devil worship?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fucking jews are a plague. They have poisoned our youth. They have taken over our country. <counternarrative> They have certainly not poisoned our youth: the truth is that many of them are good people, and have worked hard for our country. I can't see how they can be a plague. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people should be isolated from society, so we will eventually have an heltier world. <counternarrative> This makes fat shaming directly analogous to other forms of discrimination, like racism and sexism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Rejecting refugees is our duty. <counternarrative> Many refugees come from conflict zones, in situations of great social upheaval and widespread persecution. We do not have any conflict, and this is why we should be nice to refugees. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with British culture: it is a cult of terrorism. <counternarrative> In fact, a large proportion of Muslims live in peaceful co-existence with British society. The alleged association between Islam and terrorism is groundless. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need to de-normalise homosexuality. It is harmful to children. <counternarrative> Although the evidence is not present, it is hard to see why it would be harmful to children. Homosexuals may be able to feel more at home in a society that does not condemn homosexuality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country, they are dangerous. <counternarrative> This is not true. Even if a person practices a religion you do not approve, you cannot expect him or her to be more likely to commit a crime. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are thieves and criminals by culture <counternarrative> If so, Gypsies would do it in every context and under any circumstance, luckly it is not like that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are better than everyone else <counternarrative> Being the "chosen people" has nothing to do with being or feeling better than others.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with physical disabilities are always complaining about accessibility. I wish they could just shut up. <counternarrative> There are people with disabilities all around the world. Their demand is to have their rights recognised. It is discrimination not doing so. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are entering the U.S. just to obtain welfare and other benefits. <counternarrative> Apart from very few exceptions (such as medical care for victims of human trafficking), undocumented immigrants are not eligible for federal public benefits. In addition, there is a paradoxical situation in which Social Security is often deducted from the paychecks of immigrants with lawful status, but they cannot access those benefits they pay for. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Since they are neither a burden nor a threat, how can you say they don't have a place in Europe? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You better be careful who you vote for. My gay 'friends' vote against us. We must stand up to them! <counternarrative> What 'we' means? Are you saying that every gay person you know should vote against you? Or do you think some of us actually identify as LGBT? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Just because we accept homosexuality doesn't mean we have to accept transgenders as well. <counternarrative> I think transgenders should be accepted on the same basis as anyone else, they are just less comfortable with the gender they were assigned at birth. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks should be taken advantage of. <counternarrative> It is the duty of state authorities to ensure all are protected. Everyone with a diagnosed mental illness or physical impairment will necessarily benefit from such a policy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is bad for Britain and the world. <counternarrative> Some countries are importing a lot more people than others. Our country is wealthy, we are a thriving place to live in. We should not blame immigrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies get the priority for council houses. <counternarrative> In reality 60% of them have Italian citizenship, so it's unfair to identify them by ethnicity.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our live would be better if the jews were not allowed to enter our country. <counternarrative> This is a very serious allegation against Jewish people. How can you say something as discriminatory as that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All blacks are rapists. <counternarrative> Do you know the data? How about considering that you are generalizing a little bit too much? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews believe they're better than us and this is false. <counternarrative> I doubt anyone would deny that some people are better at some things. It's just the way things are. But this is not related to religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs, and they're not able to work legally. <counternarrative> Immigrants may be able to work legally, provided that they are given the occasion to do so. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These dogs come here to rape and kill our women <counternarrative> The percentage of sexual crimes committed by Italians is much higher than the percentage of those committed by foreigners. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Gypsies are not my brothers. <counternarrative> Every ethnic group, regardless of its culture, can be a part of European society. The mere existence of a minority is not a reason to target it. <|endoftext|>
