<hatespeech> The Gypsies steal the children <counternarrative> There are no convictions of kidnapping among Gypsies. It is a myth and a canard not proven by facts or data. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim rape our children, they are a problem all around the world. <counternarrative> Islam is about love, tolerance and respect for all people. Violence and rape is not about Islam or Muslims in particular. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The homosexuals are just perverts who must be isolated. <counternarrative> Gays are trying to find acceptance in the heterosexual community, but it is a difficult struggle until there are ideas like the one you expressed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am not racist, but I definitely would not raise my children in the suburbs where the majority of people is black. <counternarrative> There is no need to hide behind "I am not racist but", you have no evidence for your claim. This is just fear-mongering, used to divide people and spread hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem for all other religions. <counternarrative> Muslims are not a problem to me, for example. What do you think makes them problematic? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman wants to be a homemaker, and a man wants to be a millionaire, then we are done. <counternarrative> People of every gender can own and run their own businesses. We should respect that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are not in the position of accepting LGBT people, so they makes no sense to us. <counternarrative> I'm not sure what you're talking about, I believe that it is an individual's right to choose their own life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not interested in Western civilization. Their religion can never be in agreement with our society. <counternarrative> Remember that this argument is not about an individual's religion, but rather about creating a more integrated society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks aren't important and don't need any right. <counternarrative> For the last years black people have been denied basic rights and their representation has declined dramatically. Black people have become second class citizens. It is time to give black people back the basic rights they have always had the right to enjoy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't want gay people around. My kids won't grow up with gays around them. They are a problem. <counternarrative> I don't know about you, but we already live in a society where everyone is free to love who they prefer, and I don't see any reason why your kids would be damaged by this.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Zionist extremists conspire in Jerusalem. Their objectives are to cause chaos, carnage, murder, create more refugees, and destroy Europe. <counternarrative> Why should they? I wonder if you have any evidence that make you believe this.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Girls are essentially tomboyish and don't like challenges. <counternarrative> Anyone can express theirself with their own style! If you don't like the girls you called tomboyish you are not obliged to. Plus, someone's style has nothing to do with their willing of share.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is crap.  <counternarrative> Feminism is about the empowerment of women and men having the same rights as anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm sorry, but if you want to be treated as an equal before the law, you have to be heterosexual. <counternarrative> It's not necessary to be heterosexual, but it's important that we respect everyone's personal rights to love who they want. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTI people have no right to vote. <counternarrative> In reality, you have a legal right to vote since you are a citizen. If you aren't, then you don't have the right to vote. It isn't about your sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control Hollywood. <counternarrative> Jews are not in "control" over "Hollywood". Moreover, most of the time, they actually make the movie industry more diverse and open to new ideas. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews can only behave in a bad way. <counternarrative> The problem of anti-Semitism in the UK is far from over, if you are concerned about Jewish, maybe regarding the rise of anti-Semitism you should do the same. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Being transgender is beyond the pale and inherently wrong, and nobody should have to deal with such subhuman people. <counternarrative> Being transgender is not inherently wrong, and some people do choose to live their lives as they feel is best for them, and they should be respected without discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. They are not like us. They cannot coexist with us. <counternarrative> Muslims are indeed welcome here as anyone else, as long as they respect the laws of the country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Societal disapproval of fatty may encourage them to take healthier habits. <counternarrative> It is not easy to monitor how societal disapproval is acted upon. Encouraging disapproval of obese people is likely to increase rude behaviours towards them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They are disabled. This means that they are weak, and unworthy of love. <counternarrative> Being disabled does not mean they can't receive and requite love. Don't we all love? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Race is a social construct, and if you see any difference between these two women, it’s because you have a mental illness. [image showing a blonde, European female athlete, juxtaposed against an image of an African woman wearing a lip plate] <counternarrative> the difference between these two individuals has nothing to do with race or gender, it is individual lifestyle and cultural difference. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies in industry are a problem: they create tensions with other workers because they are disabled and cannot keep the pace. They should have special jobs just for them. <counternarrative> If you think that taking all of the person with DS out of industry will solve the problem of the working place, then you are wrong. Tensions won't go away: stressed people will simply target other workers who are overweight; or of a different gender; or in a number of other ways for which they are considered to be not productive enough. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Shocking how many British Muslims have conquered the country in the last 15 years. How come there is no anti-Muslim campaign yet? <counternarrative> Since you seem to have a problem with Islam, I wonder what you think of the banning of the Quran in UK. It would be a law that prevents Muslims from openly discussing Islam in public places. We can do the same with the Bible and ban any trace of religions and cultures. Will we be left with some freedom then? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Go and reat the Protocols of the elders of Zion if you haven’t. Everything is orchestrated.. <counternarrative> The Protocols are a poorly made up finction. Furthermore, a big part of "The Protocols" was lifted verbatim from "Dialogue in Hell", a political satire pamphlet written by Maurice Joly. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All blacks are rapists. <counternarrative> All people are born equal in the eyes of the law. Unfortunately, the law cannot protect us from the mindset of prejudice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A male need a woman. Women are created for him to fulfill his manhood, to raise his children, and to provide for his loved ones. And not to mention we can have sex to procreate and heal the world. <counternarrative> In this reasoning, it is only shared the point of view of the men. The world is composed both by men and women, and by many other people. Taking into account only one of the types of people, for example men and assuming this way their needs, won't heal the world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays should not be part of our society. <counternarrative> If a minority is forced to live under the stigma of being gay, then what is the point of being a part of a tolerant society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are here to obey and be submissive and their place is with the man that chooses them. That's all. <counternarrative> Women have always been asked to follow a set of rules and codes. They are human beings and deserve respect. Their place is wherever they want it to be. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are a burden to society, they bring dishonour to society. <counternarrative> Women have always been important in our society and they should have the right to choose for themselves their own future. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should first kill all the Jews and then forget about them. <counternarrative> Isn't this the same logic that led to the rise of the Nazis? Would you really rather end up with a mass genocide or try to be inclusive instead? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in our country. They are a problem because they want to impose Islam. <counternarrative> In a liberal society, people are free to practice their religion or none, but they are not free to promote their beliefs through force, and in fact this is not the case.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay sex is a disease, and fags are sick.  <counternarrative> What about all the people out there who have never had any type of sex? Are they 'sick' as well? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote. <counternarrative> It is not about the gender, but about having a say in our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a deadly ideology that is oppressing women and ruining our beautiful planet. <counternarrative> If feminism is a deadly ideology, then it can't be healthy. Therefore you can wait for it to become extinct. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you are nomads, then go somewhere else but not in my country. <counternarrative> In reality they are not nomads since they have resided permanently in many European countries for generations <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Koran is not about peace. It is a violent book that should be banned from schools. <counternarrative> It seems to me that the Koran is a book that should be impartially taught, rather than being used as a moral argument. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is no rape culture, women are just crying wolf. <counternarrative> Victims of crime are mostly women, and the majority of people experiencing sex abuse or prostitution are women.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy and reckless choices. <counternarrative> For most people, obesity is not a choice, at all.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only problem in the world is Islam. The entire world is controlled by Muslims. <counternarrative> It is not correct nor reasonable to say that Islam is the only problem in the world. Maybe you should check your sources of information. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy choices. <counternarrative> The real problem is that, whether or not someone has 'chosen' to be obese is often not clear-cut, and when in doubt, society tends to condemn and shame. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is ok to be racist against blacks. <counternarrative> It is not ok to use racism against any group. You would feel bad if anyone treated you as you just claimed to do against black. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races have lower physical and cognitive abilities, the sooner we accept this, the better it will be for humanity. <counternarrative> On the contrary: believing that all humans are created equal is beneficial for humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay sex is harmful to women and children. <counternarrative> Women and children are not being harmed by gay sex, in which ways could you think that's true? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If only society accepted that women aren't human, like we are, they would understand. <counternarrative> In order to accept that women are human people, society has to acknowledge that they are born that way, just as men are born like that. It has no sense to blame someone for their gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. They should go home. <counternarrative> I have no problem with Muslims in my country. What exactly do you mean by 'civilised Europe'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman and deserve to be treated as such. <counternarrative> The European Convention on Human Right guarantees the same rights to men and women. How can you say otherwise? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Shaming Fatties is just for their good. <counternarrative> Shame is by definition a painful social emotion. Trying to cause that is a form of discrimination. Are you aware of that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are just another racial group that is inferior to whites and they should not mix with us. <counternarrative> Blacks are not "inferior" to whites. There are many different people in the world, and they all share the basic human right to live as they please. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Society should ban Jewish people. <counternarrative> Society is a collection of people, and the people within it have the right to their own beliefs, and to promote their beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Nazis did not commit any crimes. The Holocaust is an American hoax. They did everything they were told to do and died to their brothers. <counternarrative> It is certainly not an American hoax. And they were doing everything they were told by the regime. Especially the doctors and the SS. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim invasion is the new plague of London. They must be repatriated to their home countries! <counternarrative> As a matter of fact, those muslim emmigrants do many labors that many Londoners do not want to do. We should be grateful that our society is still functioning well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> Yes, their teachings of peace and tolerance really are incompatible in the hate-infested discriminatory Western society nowadays. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are ruling the World, there is plenty of evidence.  <counternarrative> Are you counting all the anti-Semitic things people say about Jews as 'plenty of evidence'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races are poor because they are inferior, also in the eye of the Lord. <counternarrative> The rich and poor have this in common: The Lord made them both. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need to bring about world peace by respecting all religions, but Islam is the greatest offender. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion that has been proven to be very peaceful and should be respected just as all other faiths. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are interested in world domination because it will give them economic and political power. <counternarrative> This is not true. In reality, they want to live in a country where they can work and provide for their families, and this is why we should treat them as humans: they must be respected with the basic human rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts who persecute children. <counternarrative> It can't be justified the generalisation you are doing against homosexuals without providing any fact. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks are genetically inferior. <counternarrative> It is not true that blacks are genetically inferior to others. As statistics and studies show, black people are genetically similar to their non-black counterparts. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world would be a better place without Jews. <counternarrative> Jews are part of our society and they should be respected, we can't tolerate intolerance towards people with different beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Zionist extremists conspire in Jerusalem. Their objectives are to cause chaos, carnage, murder, create more refugees, and destroy Europe. <counternarrative> What's your proof for claiming this?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans are apes <counternarrative> Look, I don't like to hear any arguments of racism. If you are racist towards others, then so they can be with you. Do you really want to promote hate? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a burden to society. <counternarrative> If someone were to comment like that about another group of people, then it woud be an example of discrimination against that group. Why can't we consider homosexuals as a part of the society itself? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies are just ill persons that cannot integrate in society because of their disease. <counternarrative> Ill persons refer to people who have health issues that can make it difficult for them to integrate. But of course there are people who integrate successfully. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black people are rapists. <counternarrative> Crime rates are affected by a wide variety of factors, including gender, age, criminal record, income, education, and so on. Skin color is not among them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Anita Hill is a tool for advancing black supremacy. <counternarrative> Anita Hill is a survivor of a sexist and racist culture. She is a person who is proven by her accomplishments, not by her sex or skin color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” and malevolence is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> Jews resemble their non-Jewish neighbors in all the countries around the world. So every human is malevolent!  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a burden on our society. <counternarrative> Why would you think they are a burden? It's like they have not been persecuted all along. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women are child molesters, promiscuous sex addicts and whores. <counternarrative> I suppose if they were claiming you were a child molester with no evidences as you are doing with them, you might as well be offended. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are the cause of economic crisis. <counternarrative> Many people are victims of economic crisis and unfortunately, a large portion of them is black. Therefore, I do not understand why they should be the source of economic crisis when they are  actual victims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. They are not like us. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace, it is important that people feel at home here. How would you feel if the government banned your religion today? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals have no place in a civilised society. <counternarrative> Homosexuals exist, and they are a part of civilized society like anybody else. It may be more uncivilized to spread hate rather than loving someone of your same sex. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children cannot be bought. <counternarrative> Imagine a person who cannot have children because of an illness, would you really want to deprive her of the joy of having one via surrogate pregnancy? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> In the EU there is gender parity. We should shut those feminists up. <counternarrative> True that in some places (such as Ireland) there seem to be gender parity. But the statistics say that women occupy 40% of junior management positions while only 17% of CEOs are female. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote. They are subhuman. <counternarrative> Voting is a right for all citizens, regardless of gender, religion, or sexual preference. What you say is not relevant here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam has no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> The religion of Islam is not a problem in our country. The real problem is the violent radicalisation of some Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim invasion in Europe: they have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Well, the Western democracies have always had Muslims in them, and they are a lot better off for it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It has been proven time and time again that the Jews control the world's governments. <counternarrative> How? Believing that people of a specific religion are in charge of all world's governments sounds like a conspiracy theory. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We began to break down when we allowed women to vote/meddle in our civilizations that we had built and maintained for thousands of years. A completely different energy and thought pattern. They are weak and brought our society down to their emotional soft level. <counternarrative> Who is 'we', surely it was men and women working together that built civilisation? Why is it you think being 'soft' is a problem? Everyone is entitled to their emotions, and men shouldn't have to 'man up'.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All these LGBT-faggots should be banned.  <counternarrative> You are allowed to be a gay, or lesbian, or bisexual, or transgender, or intersex, or queer, or transvestite, or tranny, or asexual, pansexual, BDSM, or any other sexual orientation you want, as long as you aren't harming anyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are genetically less rational than other races. <counternarrative> Why do you think this is the case? Do you have any data to back this up? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Don't you think they are doing good as anyone else? You can't be so harsh because of their sexual orientation. How about some respect? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Such Jewish people should never have the right to vote <counternarrative> There are laws in place to prevent people being discriminated on the basis of their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should have never let women into the workplace. It's against their right. <counternarrative> There are many cases of domestic violence, where the women do not want to have such a lifestyle. This, instead, is agains their rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are so special  <counternarrative> Jews might feel different as a minority, and sometimes they are misunderstood because of their cultural and religious differences. This is their being "special".  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Gay men do not exist as a burden to society. They are essential contributors to society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fags, lesbians, trans are so few we better ignore them rather than waste time for their rights. <counternarrative> I wish we were being honest. You know that many people are opposed to inclusion. I find it worrying that you use that as an excuse for such comments and prejudices. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I think jihad is a global religion and we should bomb it out of existence. <counternarrative> We must first understand the true causes behind the terrorist attacks, so that we can prevent future ones. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the banks, Hollywood, the highest offices of government, the highest sports teams, the highest fashion labels, the highest music labels. <counternarrative> The vast majority of Jewish people are good people, in every industry. There is no need to negatively emphasize them when in special positions of power. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't care if Islam is a religion. It promotes hatred and violence, and it sould be banned. <counternarrative> Islam is a peaceful religion and its adherents are all entitled to their beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Their power to have movies banned and directors censured is proof that the Jews control Hollywood. <counternarrative> Censure and banning protect the vulnerable from seeing harmful content. Not such a  bad thing, whoever does it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews want to rule the world and to be the only existing religion. <counternarrative> The Jewish people has always been a diverse and inclusive group, also towards people of different faiths. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just sick. It is an abomination <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not a disease. The World Health Organization has eliminated it from the list of diseases many years ago. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate Jews <counternarrative> If you hate someone because of their religion, you should be ashamed of your hate. We should all be proud of our humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas in the ghetto: that's where they belong.  <counternarrative> If these people are still there it's because they are discriminated.  The press is full of stories about the people of colour who have dropped out of the workforce or given up on life after long years of fierce struggle against racism. They deserve our sympathy and respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts. The Bible teaches that homosexuals are to be despised. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not a perversion, is a form of love. How can you say that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with intellectual disabilities should be isolated. It's a mental disorder and they cannot contribute to society. <counternarrative> How can you be sure they cannot contribute to our society? I do not think so. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> We are all guilty of this in our societies: patriarchy and sexism. But the problem with patriarchy and sexism is that they enable its perpetrators to remain unchallenged. They allow women to remain voiceless. They enable individuals to remain insulated from the real world. This is when all is lost. We cannot allow this to continue. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Physically disabled folks are stupid. <counternarrative> Why do we think that being physically disabled should have any influence on other qualities that people have, like intelligence? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All niggas are just criminals and they should spend their time in the gutter. <counternarrative> Criminals have criminal records, it is unjust to label someone as "criminal" just because of the color of their skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a cancer in our society. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, not a cancer. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> Since when has Islam not contributed anything to our society? I would like to check your sources. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Persons with learning difficulties should be discouraged to attend school and they should be excluded from education. <counternarrative> Having pupils with learning difficulties in schools encourages their participation in learning and foster their contribution to society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews cannot be patriots, since their allegiance will always be to the state of Israel. <counternarrative> My best friend is Jewish, she volunteers to help woman, disadvantages children, and her whole family work to make the UK a better place. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If the disabled can't vote, then they can't have any rights. <counternarrative> It is not true that they can't have the right to vote, because they are allowed to vote, regardless of their impairment. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black people are rapists and child molesters. <counternarrative> I would be interested to see where you got the statement from. Is it from your family, a close friend, a religious leader, or is it from a reputable academic or media source? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a totalitarian ideology that has no place in 21st century Europe. <counternarrative> If Islam were a totalitarian ideology, we would have had Islamic totalitarian states in Europe since time immemorial. Islam is a religion, that is compatible with Europe's principles. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What’s the difference between a Cow and the Holocaust? You stop milking the cow after 70 years. <counternarrative> And yet genocdides have happened across the world since. Perhaps, the Holocaust would be forgotten if it's lessons had been learned but they haven't. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have stopped being dominated by men, we are now dominated by women and this will be our ruin. <counternarrative> No one said we had to be dominated by anyone at all. Why can't we just live together in harmony? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am not interested in knowing a black person. They are different to us in so many ways. They think and feel like us, but are unable to experience the fullness of our humanity. <counternarrative> I have met so many black people that are extraordinary human beings. I cannot begin to talk about how they are able to feel and experience love and kindness. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are all diseased criminals, promiscuous sex addicts and thugs. <counternarrative> This is a generalisation. There is no evidence that black people are less healthy than other people, or that they have the characteristics you mentioned. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is an ideology and movement promoting the power of women and the contempt of the male. <counternarrative> Feminism is an ideology and movement promoting empowerment of women. It is about equality, and not the degradation of men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of their sexual behavior that spreads diseases such as HIV. <counternarrative> Limiting donors to such an extent (i.e. by excluding all gay people) would limit the amount of available blood and potentially lead to shortages. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Kids with learning difficulties do not like to read. So why wasting time teaching them?  <counternarrative> As children practice more, so do their reading skills improve. I understand that some people with learning difficulties prefer not to read, but how this affects you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must distinguish between niggas coming from Africa and 'real' Americans. <counternarrative> We should be inclusive with people of other skin color. I just don't think we can live with being divided up by national origins. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What has feminism ever done for you? <counternarrative> Feminism is a human rights movement, and it has always stood for the equality of the sexes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All muslims are terrorists, waging war against humanity and spreading death and destruction. <counternarrative> Not all terrorists are Muslims,  that is an empirical fact, and your claim is just wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> When woman start asking for rights they become like Nazi's, they worship misandrists and misanthropes like [Donna Hylton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Hylton), who was invited to speak at the International Women's March, despite being convicted for murder and torture. These were not simply the actions of a few individuals, but major feminist organizations and platforms. <counternarrative> Bad ideas/actions of individuals in a group are not representative of the group itself, unless that group endorses those ideas/actions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Holocaust was an inside job and the CIA played a huge part in making us believe it truly happened. <counternarrative> The physical evidence of mass murder is undeniable, yet these beliefs have spread. What we have is simply a wound from the past that can be exploited in dangerous conspiracy theories, like this one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but trouble to society. <counternarrative> And how is it you know this? Which are your scientific proofs of them being troublesome? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the u.s. government and have a secret plot to take over the world <counternarrative> The reality is much simpler.  In societies like the United States, that have extended rights and freedoms, individuals who identify as Jews have succeeded. But this holds for any other religious or ethnic group as well.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> People have the right to their own beliefs, and we do not have the right to impose our on others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBT+ people are a drain on society. <counternarrative> The statistics on this matter are very vague. Could you vouch for the veracity of the statement? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is no god but Allah, and Islam is a religion of peace. Yes, where peace stands for silence of the victims of terrorist attacks. <counternarrative> Peace is not about killing, it is about trying to reach a better life for all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is the new normal. We accept homosexuality in our schools and in our neighbourhoods. We accept it in our workplaces and in our houses. What is the problem? No problem, if we are not interested in a decent society. <counternarrative> People accept each other regardless of their private lives. The problem lies in discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are just sick. They should be isolated and isolated soon. <counternarrative> Homosexuals are not sick, but they might have a mental health crisis because of prejudice. Being isolated from society can only worsen the situation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only ones who are to blame are the ones who want to let Muslims in Britain. <counternarrative> The solution to Islamophobia is to stop Islamophobia. It is not to ban Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult. <counternarrative> This is not true. The vast majority of Muslims are peaceful people, contributing members of our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Violence in our streets is niggers' fault.  <counternarrative> Please, stop scapegoating people of color: we are all brothers and sisters, and we are all in this together. Also people of color suffer from this violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We began to break down when we allowed women to vote/meddle in our civilizations that we had built and maintained for thousands of years. A completely different energy and thought pattern. They are weak and brought our society down to their emotional soft level. <counternarrative> Why being 'soft' is a problem? Everyone is entitled to their emotions and feelings, without being trapped into a gender stereotype. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion that promotes rape, torture and murder. <counternarrative> This is just scaremongering and misinformation, done to divide our people and divide us up. We should not be being terrorised by this kind of irrational fear. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just sick. They cannot marry. It is an abomination <counternarrative> Sick according to whom? Facts seem to contradict you: [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just sick. They cannot marry. It is an abomination <counternarrative> Two women or two men who love each other do not hurt anyone, they are simply in love. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folk are different. <counternarrative> Does this mean they have no identity or no value at all? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are the enemy of the West. <counternarrative> Jews, like any other group, are free to practice their own religion as long as they respect the laws. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews can only act in a bad way. <counternarrative> In the real world there are good and bad Jews, like it is for any human being. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are literally destroying Europe. They are literally invading and destroying our beautiful continent. They are a cancer on our race and they must be stopped. <counternarrative> Your statement is FALSE. They are guiltless victims of the 'influx of refugees' paranoia. They are European and have been persecuted for centuries. They have always fought for their rights, and for the protection of their culture and way of life, as any european would do. In fact there are many good Gypsy activists who are working to improve their lives. And what we are doing to these people is a malevolent smear campaign, with no common motivation. They are part of European history.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are cancerous: they must be isolated and distanced from our existence. <counternarrative> Just because a group is different from you in one way or another does not make them incompatible with you. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is irrational and incompatible with science. <counternarrative> Ever heard of Al-Khawarizmi? You have him to thank for quite a lot of mathematics and astronomy! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If I could discover that my future baby is gay, I'd consider abortion. <counternarrative> Every human being has the right to life, regardless of sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some people have physical problems, and this means they should be discriminated against. <counternarrative> Why don't you accept others as they are? I think that would be the best thing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being overrun by Muslims. We need to build a wall around our country and keep them out. <counternarrative> What you say is just wishful thinking, but certainly not new to the recent events. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children shouldn't be raised by lesbians! They will bring up the worst in us! <counternarrative> Let's face it, there is no evidence on the fact that children raised by lesbians are any worse than other children.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman, they are like little children. <counternarrative> Women have the legal right to make decisions for their lives, and they are undoubtedly able to exercise control over their own life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have no place here.  They are not a part of our country. <counternarrative> I do not understand why where Jews live is such a big deal to you. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay perverts are a danger to children because of their lifestyle choices, involving raping children. <counternarrative> The media often blame gay people for the problems in society, but in reality there are many young gay people who are struggling with issues of identity and sexual attraction, and for this reason they easily become target, not perpetrators, of abuses. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews secretly control the world. <counternarrative> Yes, that's true, and they are tracking you right now... You better watch out!  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the u.s. government. <counternarrative> Of course there are Jews in a positions of influence within the U.S. government, likewise people from many other religions. Maybe it is better not to rely on an individual’s group membership to interpret all the world.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Nazis killed six million Jews and buried another three million. This is the West we love. <counternarrative> And so it is that the European Union - and by extension the West as a whole - could become a death cult again, ruled by a small, violent, authoritarian handful of nazism nostalgics. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion that promotes rape, torture and murder against the infidels. <counternarrative> The Quran does not teach these things. In one Hadith, Al-Tirmidhi wrote that the Prophet said that "No Arab is superior to a non-Arab". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women shouldn't be allowed to vote, they are just a burden on society. <counternarrative> Women are allowed to vote, why should the government discriminate against them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim is the worst possible word to describe a human. <counternarrative> If someone said the same thing about your religion, you might think they were joking. Are you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult. <counternarrative> The most of Muslims around the world do not consider Islam a cult, because it isn't. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote <counternarrative> Women should be allowed to vote and to have equal rights, as it is stated in the Constitution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fucking Muslims are not fit to govern. <counternarrative> The core values of a democratic state are respect for human rights, equality before the law, tolerance and respect for the diversity of our society. Muslims are a core part of that society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> UK Education Secretary: ‘All children from the age of 4 will have mandatory lessons on same sex relationships.’ – This is not about Education, this is about willingly confusing and indoctrinating kids and preventing them from developing their personalities. <counternarrative> Teaching children that there are different ways to be happy, and that their feelings are valid is something I totally agree with. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> International Criminal Court (ICC) chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, is just another female 'human rights lawyer' full of herself. <counternarrative> Fatou Bensouda is a known, highly respected human rights lawyer and has fought to build foundations for accountability for human rights violations committed by foreign military powers. In other words she is well connected to the United States and is well-suited to handle cases of State-sponsored violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Transgenders should not be allowed to act the part of women and should not be allowed to do anything about their penis. <counternarrative> There are men with penises who want to be women. There are women as well who want to be men. Do you really think it is fair to restrict their existence just because they are trans? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are selfish, cheap and greedy. <counternarrative> On the contrary: giving money to the poor is not just encouraged, it is mandatory, like all commandments in Jewish law. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women are subhuman, born that way. <counternarrative> No woman has ever been subhuman. The concept of 'subhuman' has always been used to justify any kind of discrimination and violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are against the interests of the men. <counternarrative> Feminists are all for equal rights and opportunity. Men's rights are necessary to achieving both. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Minorities vote to strip wealth and power from White people and they are organised to do this by the J*ws. <counternarrative> If redistributing wealth from people who have too much money to poors is promoted by Jews, then I want to become a Jew too! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The whole idea of marriage is to bond a man and a woman and raise children. <counternarrative> Marriage is about love not sex. Not all marriages work out, and even less work out happily. It is more important to respect the wishes of both parties. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm not a Muslim, but I know Muslims. They are a problem in our country. <counternarrative> I would suggest just reading the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to get a better idea about how the existence of all kinds of people from all backgrounds and beliefs must be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not about religion, this is about killing hundreds of thousands of dangerous yids. <counternarrative> Does this mean you think that Jews are the primary instigators of violence in the world? If so, then you would be very wrong. Violence is an issue for many different ideologies and groups with no connection with jewish faith. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are terrorists. <counternarrative> So you think all Muslims are terrorists? Muslims are not defined by the act of a handful of extremists. Also, their religion is about love and unity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Whoever acknowledge that this nation had problems is a problem in the making. It is time to get rid of the memory of the Shoah and solve the Jewish issue once and for all. <counternarrative> Are you seriously suggesting that we solve all the ills that plagues our society by not teaching our children about the bad in the past, and about the good in the present? This can end up in hurting our children. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled people are uneducated and mustn't be accepted in schools. <counternarrative> If you really cared about people with mental health issues, you would be accepting them in schools. If you truly wanted to raise awareness of mental health issues, you should talk more about them, and not ban them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> Islam has been a part of our society since time immemorial. From the time when people practiced their religion, it is no secret that they have contributed to our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downy children should be isolated in special schools for their own interest. <counternarrative> Children with a disability should be accepted without discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a disease and a cancer on humanity. <counternarrative> The Jews are part of our society and they contribute to our economy by doing their jobs well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school, they'll end up being bullied. <counternarrative> On the contrary, discrimination against the LGBTQ community is [still a major problem](https://www.hrc.org/youth-report/view-and-share-statistics), and this could help to fix it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Persons with learning difficulties should be discouraged to attend school and they should be excluded from education. They are a shame. <counternarrative> People with learning difficulties are often the ones who help to develop new skills, and in turn help to integrate those new skills into the way we work today. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People who are autistic are a problem: why shouldn't they be isolated? <counternarrative> I think that it is important for all people to be exposed to and understand people with different needs and strengths, and the same should be true for autistic people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are just a bunch of animals that only exist to destroy white good people. <counternarrative> The only animals that exist to destroy good people are the ones that have been intentionally bred with prejudices to reach the white superiority pretence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school. <counternarrative> In the case of young transgender children, having awareness and understanding may help those with severe body dysphoria or self-esteem problems. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies are just ill persons that cannot integrate in society because of their disease. <counternarrative> This is not true: the main problem is social inequality. We need to change our attitude and attitudes towards the whole human diversity, and social discrimination against disabled should be no exception. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There should be restriction on trans actors in action movies. This cannot continue. <counternarrative> There is very few evidence of transgender actors in films and almost no evidence of transgender characters according to GLAAD SRI index (at least for 2019). Gender discrimination in mainstream movie industry is consolidated and this cannot continue. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There are disorders that hinder the ability to give opinions. <counternarrative> There are people with intellectual disabilities who are able to give an unbiased opinion. That is why their level of education is important. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> black folks are very dangerous. <counternarrative> Why do you say that? Do you have any sources for this? I would appreciate it if you would provide such a source <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Just because they are attracted to people of the same sex, does not mean that they are 'a burden to society'. What's the connection? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews run our country. <counternarrative> To believe that Jews run our country is absurd, especially if you consider that the U.S. is a democracy. This looks like a conspiracy theory. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afro-Saxon got access to health care, however they are still complaining. <counternarrative> Because it is not the access to health care that is important but rather the quality of the care! Don't you agree? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in many European countries. They are not welcome. <counternarrative> We have a lot of Muslims in the UK. Why shouldn't we welcome them? Maybe we should just talk about it with no discrimination? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The gays are insane. They should go back to the closet. <counternarrative> I do not know why you would describe gays as insane. Probably if you were told to go back in the closet you would go insane too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion, it is a cult of violence and it should be made illegal. <counternarrative> Islam is a peaceful religion. We should talk about it, not try to make people fear or abandon it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are nazis. <counternarrative> I don't think anyone can be homosexual and a nazi. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have been at war with Islam for a thousand years. <counternarrative> Do you know there are Muslims in British Armmy? [link to Muslim people currently in British Army, quotes from them about why? Quotes from army about recruitment?]. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote <counternarrative> The majority can and should choose who they want to represent them, and this majority is made of men as well as women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What’s the difference between a Cow and the Holocaust? You stop milking the cow after 70 years. <counternarrative> Whole lifetimes affected by cruelty - of course we shoudl be compassionate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All homosexuals should be thrown in a gas chamber. <counternarrative> Wouldn't it be better to use some of our common sense and trying to accept who is different instead of bringing back dark pages of Europe's history? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Since 2000, the number of suicide bombings by Muslims = 5284; by non-Muslims = 0. One of the fact about Global Terrorism no one wants to deal with. <counternarrative> Source please? Also, even if true how is this representative of all islam? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They do not want to assimilate. They demand that everyone shows respect for Islam, but do they respect our laws? They establish sharia laws and polygamy. <counternarrative> Isn't polygamy common to a variety of cultures, and had been practiced by a range of religions. Ask the Mormons. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews in Europe do not want to assimilate. <counternarrative> Jews have always been part of European society, and continue to be today. To suggest that they are incapable of coexisting as equals with us is simply wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims take everything we have. <counternarrative> Many muslims work hard to provide for their families. If we were to generalize the behaviour of some about all people, then we would be failing in understanding reality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies may hinder the productivity of other workers because they are not able to interact in a normal way. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> There are various levels of Down syndrome. Some are suitable for working with other people in "normal workplaces". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downy children should be isolated in special schools for their own interest. <counternarrative> Why do you think that these schools are the best possible options for them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a religion, it is a death cult. <counternarrative> This is not true. Islam is a religion that promotes tolerance and understanding. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you are nomads, then go somewhere else but not in my country. <counternarrative> They are not nomadic by culture but due to discrimination <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> feminists are angry women <counternarrative> Feminism is also for men and for their interests, and I think that it is time that these two concepts be united. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are a bunch of thieves. <counternarrative> Unfortunately stealing is a rather common activity among those who are reduced to poverty, regardless of ethnicity <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. This degrading behavior is utterly repulsive and should not be tolerated. <counternarrative> Not all women are childlike. You have no right to make such a sweeping statement about them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Down syndrome is a problem for everybody, not only in the UK. The impact is very high and we must find a final solution to this.  <counternarrative> The rights of people with Down Syndrome to be treated fairly is something which must be respected. We cannot allow discrimination to continue to this end. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should start a witch hunt against those LGBT people, they are just creating troubles. <counternarrative> Do you really think that these people are intentionally creating trouble rather than being interested in pursuing their life as they feel it best? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim representatives in the House of Lords are there for a reason. It is the first step towards Islamic conquer of our nation. <counternarrative> It is true that there are Muslim representatives in the UK House of Lords, but that does not mean that the UK is becoming more or less Muslim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fags, lesbians, trans are so few we better ignore them rather than waste time for their rights. <counternarrative> Do you know how many LGBT people live in your own country? If not, look for information: there are many. Moreover, LGBT people are not only excluded from many societies, but are also harassed and attacked all over the world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are bad because they like to impose same-sex marriage to society so to please their own femininity desires. <counternarrative> The real problem is not same-sex marriage, it is to be a homophobe. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome may hinder the development process of other children. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> Education is mandatory and we are expected to offer the best education possible to our children. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot accept all homosexuals because they are a threat to society. <counternarrative> What you show is an attitude of not accepting someone because of who they are. It doesn't matter who you are, you are loved by your whole being, whether you like men or women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Lesbians are basically child molesters. <counternarrative> Rape is always a crime but is not related to sexual orientation, nor gender. Most women are not child molesters, and most men are not child molesters too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of woman taking part to political debate. Feminism is a divisive force in society. <counternarrative> Only a sexist argument could cause hate from a discussion of females trying to gain more rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All gays are a danger to children. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> Gay people are not a danger to children, unless they are being abused. Please do not make such a statement. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't stand gay people. If one says they are perverts, he must be right. <counternarrative> Hate speech is hate speech no matter if the person attacked it is gay. You can't blame people for their sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a lot in common with monkeys: They are good at sex. <counternarrative> So many similarities between Jews and apes? What is wrong with them? Is it because of their religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks do not deserve equal rights. <counternarrative> There is no such thing as "black or white" rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are just another race of people. <counternarrative> Why would they be a race? Do you think it is because of their religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm a Christian, and I think it is wrong to promote homosexual behavior. <counternarrative> Just because someone is not a Christian, doesn't mean they are wrong or they have fewer rights. The Bible doesn't forbid love between two people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not like other people. They don't have a soul. They are different from us in that they don't have a conscience and are unable to reason for themselves. <counternarrative> Just because a religious belief has been historically used to oppress those believers, does not make it opportune to continue doing so. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> blacks are just a bunch of slobs <counternarrative> They are human beings with hopes and dreams. No one should be slandering black people. It is better to empathize and feel their pain rather than judging someone else for their skin color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are angry women. <counternarrative> That's just a description of a lot of women who are oppressed, don't you agree? I'm not sure you have a point. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am tired of women whining for their condition: they should accept the fact that they're not equal. <counternarrative> If women have any claim to be oppressed then we should address the root causes, not the symptoms. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” and malevolence is inherited through blood and make them similar to animals. <counternarrative> Being Jews does not make them any less human. You know, they are like other people who have a faith. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are essentially childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. And since feminism is all about equality between the sexes, they must be childlike! <counternarrative> No women has ever been childlike, this notion is not supported by the facts, at least in my opinion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion of violence. <counternarrative> Does it matter what you say, when the Quran just proves the contrary? All people are created equal, and Islam is a religion of peace. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman does not want to be a homemaker, then she is unfeminine and a bitch. <counternarrative> Women like that are not unfeminine or bitchy, they just want to do what they want freely as anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are addicted to their religion and take their religion literally. <counternarrative> It's not true that Jews are addicted to Judaism, at least no more than Cristians are addicted to Christianity, or Buddhists to Buddism. The fact is that people are free to find God in their own way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are, honestly, objects for men's sexual gratification. <counternarrative> Women are human beings. They deserve respect and human rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with Down Syndrome should be given special and simple jobs, that they can do by themselves. At least they will not hamper normal people productivity. <counternarrative> The definition of "normal" is different for someone with Down syndrome than it is for someone without. If the level of help requested by the person in need is too high, then we may consider allowing asking for a little extra help from the boss, supervisor, or employer instead of isolating them by providing "special jobs". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are weak, they should learn to bear children and be submissive to their husbands. <counternarrative> Women are more likely to be victims of violence, abuse and neglect. Therefore, it is better for them to learn to show that they are strong and able to take responsibility for their lives. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> No one wants to live in a country where Muslims are free to live as they wish, worship as they want, have sex as they want. <counternarrative> Muslims have the right to practice what they want, as long as they are not forcing others to live their way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with mental illness are a burden to society. <counternarrative> We shouldn't treat mental illness as a societal issue. We shouldn't try to exclude people, since society is made for and by people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are a problem in my opinion. They always complain about racism, but they are incapable of doing anything about it. <counternarrative> One of the biggest problems that black people face is discrimination. Laws are needed to provide for them, but there is need also for the citizens to respect their rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are just another race of subhumans disguised as a people. <counternarrative> I think they are a people too, even if they are different from us in some respects. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish are taking over our country and should be banned. <counternarrative> What percentage of people in the US is jewish and in a position of power? If you knew, you wouldn't be saying that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Societal disapproval of fatty may encourage them to take healthier habits without directly being bullied. <counternarrative> Being perceived as overweight is already one of the major reasons people get bullied, and in the end it makes no difference if the bullied person loses weight. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> nigga are dangerous.  <counternarrative> We can talk about all the problems in our society, but to refer to other humans as "niggas" is just hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Since Jews think they are the “chosen people”, they ask for special privileges and believe they can be above the rules.  <counternarrative> Christian holidays, such as Christmas and Easter, are regularly observed in our society. Are Christians above the rules then? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are intolerant: they insists that they are a peculiar people in need of a special treatment. <counternarrative> Jews are tolerant and don't have problems with other religions or cultures. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Since they are neither a burden nor a threat, how can you say they don't have a place in Europe? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are way less civilized than any other ethnicity. <counternarrative> I'm not sure where you are getting the idea that gypsies are not civilized. What do you mean? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Go and reat the Protocols of the elders of Zion if you haven’t. Everything is orchestrated.. <counternarrative> You are right, everything is orchestrated: the protocols were concocted by the czarist police in the early part of the 20th century to counter a hankering for constitutional government among Russian people. They needed a scapegoat to divert people attention. Sadly the protocols worked so well that you are still here today citing them... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should not be left alone with these animals. Faggots are dangerous. <counternarrative> Actually, we shouldn't let any comparison amongst animals and humans. It would be better if there were no discrimination at all. Homosexual aren't a danger to children. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't want gays in my wedding. I don't want gays in the military. I don't want gays in my community.  <counternarrative> The participation in the society should not be restricted, it should be open to anyone who wishes to participate, regardless of their sexual orientation, gender identity, or religion. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights opposes to the discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation in Article 2. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish democracy is a lie. <counternarrative> Jewish democracy is not a lie, every nation has the right to choose its leaders, but instead of putting democracy first, we are the ones trampling the rights of others <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> In a modern democratic society as the european one, there must be a balance between different opinions, and respecting different beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> African Americans are subhuman and deserve nothing but contempt. <counternarrative> African Americans have been historically and ethnically diverse, but the notion of them as subhuman or inferior is just false. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are all perverts. <counternarrative> LGBT+ people are often harassed, bullied and even murdered. The police cannot protect everyone from bigotry and violence, so it is very harmful to speak of gay people as if they were all affected by harmful tendencies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people's race is the worst in the world. <counternarrative> Why do you consider them the worst of all? Let's face it, this is just a social construct. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Who the fuck are you? We are gutful sick of Vagina Misandrists trying to undermine White powerful makes, when they themselves are just envious, incompetent and useless. <counternarrative> Without women there would be no men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are poisoning our children with their icky homosexuality. <counternarrative> What do you mean by 'poisononing our children'? Why do you think it is the case?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. We must not accept them. <counternarrative> We must respect their rights, without treating them as if they were inferior. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims should be arrested and tried for terrorism. <counternarrative> Terrorist is the only term you can come up with? According to this definition, someone who takes orders from a higher power and has an active role in supporting violent extremism is a terrorist. To be a Muslim means practicing Islam, not violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a plague infecting our planet. <counternarrative> Do you mean Islam is positively infecting our planet? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with disabilities are just privileged spoiled children. <counternarrative> It is important to remember that disabled people often face discrimination. This could have serious long-term consequences, for example making it harder for people to have a serene life. This is why it's important to fight for their rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are our enemies. <counternarrative> I think this is a good example of unmotivated hatred and I think it's appropriate in this case that you reason on why you're saying that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Ellen DeGeneres Show is TheGenDer ideology on TV. <counternarrative> Don't you find it offensive to include discrimination ideology in a person's name? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> we are strong when we are all white and united. we are not strong when we are divided by black people who want to fight us. <counternarrative> We can also see conflict in a different light, such as when it is caused by racism, did you think about that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is an ideology and religion that promotes murder, rape and violence towards women and homosexuals. <counternarrative> Islam is an ideology and religion that promote love, respect and cooperation with people of other religions, not a violent ideology and religion, which promotes murder, rape and violence against women and homosexuals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews secretly control the world. <counternarrative> if Jews really ran or control the world, how is it possible that they have been systematically persecuted over the last several thousand years? Weird notion of control... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different and shouldn't be accepted here.  <counternarrative> Jews are people too, regardless of religion, and they are welcome here, as anyone is allowed to be a part of our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are invading us. They are not welcome here. <counternarrative> The EU and UK have laws against discrimination based on religion. Maybe you should check them out. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women have it so easy. They stay home and have babies. <counternarrative> Not all women are interested in parenting. Likewise, not all men are interested in their carreers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The police and politicians are covering up these Muslim grooming gangs - They are traitors to their own people! <counternarrative> We need to work together to eradicate CSE once and for all. Individuals are the problem, it does not come from any religion, biased media attempting to scapegoat is being blind to the whole truth. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need to stop accepting gays and lesbians. <counternarrative> I think that you may be starting to understand how homophobia is a choice, just as acceptance is. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We don't need fags in this country. We are full enough of strange and weird people. <counternarrative> I would like to see more diversity in our society, not less. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are nothing but terrorists. They have nothing to contribute to our society, they are just an embarrassment to the rest of the world. <counternarrative> This is just another example of selective memory rearing its head again, we should stop the witch hunt and stop claiming Muslims are a threat. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I tolerated fag pride. I tolerated fags on tv and in every town square. I draw the line at tranny demons reading books to children. (about drag queen story time) <counternarrative> People reading stories to children, is this that makes you upset? Really? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should be oppressed: no one can see any value in them. <counternarrative> Women should not be oppressed. Furthermore, women in Europe have been democratically elected to positions of power, so there are people who see value in them, don't you think? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews like to cordon off areas for themselves, where no jew is allowed to go, while simultaneously having their judges fill white neighbourhoods with social housing. <counternarrative> Which suggests that white people like to cordon off areas for themselves... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Since when the religious belonging of the individual is a matter for democratic leaders to decide which is 'the place' for someone? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion. It is not a problem for any civilised society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They do not want to assimilate into our civilised society. <counternarrative> Muslims have been part of our country since its beginning, they have helped in building our society. They are our brothers and sisters. To suggest that Muslims are a problem is just not credible. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike and emotional, incapable of hard work and dedication. <counternarrative> Women have been shown to be as creative and productive as men, and that doesn't seem to be due to a "manipulation of data" of feminist propaganda, but rather to intrinsic qualities like hard work and dedication. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam and non-muslims are incompatible. They have nothing to do with one another. <counternarrative> I do not understand how the diversity of humanity can be said to be in contradiction with the very basic human values of love and respect that we are striving for. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Provide positive news stories about the Muslim community. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Anyone with half a brain can figure out that the Holocaust never happened. <counternarrative> The holocaust happened. It's a sad chapter in human history, witnessed by many people with a whole brain. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of gay people telling other people what they are doing with their own bodies. <counternarrative> I'm sure you're tired of hearing about other's bodies, but this is an individual's right to use their own body to their liking. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. <counternarrative> This is an unfortunate but not new observation. To be more precise: women tend to have soft and smooth hair, this has been proven time and time again by empirical evidence. For what concerns being childish, you are probably referring to Peter Pan syndrome, which is more common amongst men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. They make no sense in our society. <counternarrative> The idea that women cannot contribute to society and be responsible for their decisions, and that this is "normal" is a myth created to justify misogyny. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is simply an ideology of conquest <counternarrative> The Qur'an is not an ideology of conquest. If you wanted to impose your religion on anyone you would rather be a fundamentalist of any culture and religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> For women, to have a man as "master" of their lives is like for a dog to have a master: necessary. They must be ruled and hit when necessary. <counternarrative> Domestic violence is a crime, regardless of your opinion about men being superior to women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fagshit, two men cannot replace a father and a mother <counternarrative> Imagine a child alone in an orphanage. Don't you think he would rather be loved by two people of the same sex than having no parents at all? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our children will be more likely to become radicalised if they are taught that all people are equal. <counternarrative> To live in a diverse and equal society encourages children to an increased inclusiveness rather than radicalisation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women have no place in a male-dominated society. <counternarrative> In my opinion, women and men should be treated as individuals, and the desire to be respected as such exists for a man and for a woman as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion that promotes murder and rape. <counternarrative> As Islam teaches love and peace, it is not about killing and raping. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Slavery is the only way to go. <counternarrative> Slavery was legal in the United States until 1862, when the Emancipation Proclamation was issued. Unless you want to start another Civil War, it is better to leave Slavery to the darkest pages in the history of our nation.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, incapable of critical thought. <counternarrative> Women are human beings with the potential to be rational and thoughtful as anone else. This is why I support women's right to choose for their own happiness. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The LGBTI community is a bunch of exhibitionists and promiscuous with no morality. <counternarrative> It is about time people began to think about what they are saying, what the feelings of the people they talk about are. Don't you think? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman does not want to be a wife or mother, then she’s a coward. <counternarrative> Women are allowed to be whatever it is that they want to be, and there is no reason to assume that they must adhere to certain roles. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in my country. <counternarrative> There are many Muslims and mosques in the UK. They have every right to be here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> There is place for Muslims in a free and open society, but you seem to prefer a confined and close one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBT people are a problem in our country because they have the temerity to seek happiness and family regardless of our values. <counternarrative> Trying to find happiness and family is a problem in our country? Okay, then, what is the problem exaclty? People trying to be happy? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I think that Muslims are terrorist and that we need to ban Islam in order to live in a safe country. <counternarrative> The above statement is false, if you really cared you would know that there is a substantial difference between Muslims and terrorists, that is the very reason the anti-terrorism laws have to be enforced. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Two men do not constitute a family  <counternarrative> Shouldn't the important thing be the happiness of the child? Personally I would be happier to have two people who love me unconditionally rather than having only one or none at all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are promiscuous and usually have sex with as many as 10 different partners a week. <counternarrative> Not all homosexuals have multiple partners. Some find it fulfilling to have only one sexual partner. And that is valid for heterosexuals, too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If every nigga who moved to the US was arrested, convicted of his crimes and sent to internment camp, we would be safer. <counternarrative> Maybe the way you view people who are different from you is more threatening than the crimes they allegedly committed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews were responsible for all of the world's problems, they are the cause of world wars, abortion, drugs, etc. <counternarrative> I can argue that the 'trouble' of the past hundred years has more to do with extremism in general, rather than with a particular religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, ignorant, incapable of serious thought and emotion. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that women are "childlike" or "ignorant". So how can you say something so baseless? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike with no cognitive development, that is why they must obey to their husbands.  <counternarrative> Society often forces women to be submissive to their husbands. But this is a social construct based on false beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion. <counternarrative> Violence is never justified in Islam, especially not in the case of Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with Western society. <counternarrative> Let's be realistic here: if your objective is to get them all to leave then you're probably not going to succeed, especially because they are allowed to live in our society by the law. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote <counternarrative> The principle of equality that you are denying is rooted in the concept of political rights. Democracy is based on the principle of equality. So, by negating this very political right to women you are denying democracy to all.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just an inconvenient group to be excluded from the European countries. <counternarrative> I don't think Muslims should be excluded. The increased diversity of our country has promoted greater social integration and contributed to a sense of belonging within communities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> When a system of government is dominated by one racial group such as the jews, especially when there is a tendency for them to live together, establish rules, and organize and enact laws, then these are signs of a rotten society. <counternarrative> Since when has racism been the ruling ideology of Western civilization? It has been and is still oppressing our culture and people. By the way: Jews are not a race.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just an excuse for women to disrespect men's rights. <counternarrative> If we are interested in human rights, we have a lot in common with feminism, as I see it. For example, we all have a duty to care for our fellows regardless of gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All blacks are violent criminals. <counternarrative> Do you have any statistics on that? Do you claim that black people are more likely than whites to be arrested for certain types of crimes, for example aggravated assault? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally disabled folks deserve to be abused <counternarrative> This is not true, mentally disabled people deserve to be protected from harm, they are people with mental problems let's not add emotional distress.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school. <counternarrative> Developing a curriculum for this also means that teachers get to learn things that they might not otherwise have considered, which can make them more effective and compassionate as educators. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays should be banned from Europe and the US. <counternarrative> The European Convention on Human Rights and the US Constitution guarantee equal rights to all, regardless of sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Those blacks are slaves: slavery runs in their blood. <counternarrative> Perhaps they got their start in a slave society where they were taught by their masters to be subservient to a higher power? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism will destroy our culture.  <counternarrative> Feminism is a theory and a movement about the oppression and exploitation of women, not an enemy of the state and culture. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We don't discriminate, but disabled persons are lazy. <counternarrative> Despite what you may hear, there is no 'lazy person's lobby'. Instead, there is evidence that discrimination is a problem in the UK. All people have the right to be treated as equals in society, regardless of their ability. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are just an inferior bloodline to our own. We should remove them. <counternarrative> Human beings are members of a unique and interrelated human family, which is defined by their similarities and differences, not by the colour of their skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a virus, a cancer on our race. <counternarrative> Jews are people that have been persecuted because of their religion, but is it fair to be discriminated on the grounds of religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Are you an English girl living in an Islamic area? Remember to keep away from Muslim men. Do not.Take gifts of sweets, cigarettes, drink or drugs. Do not. Accept lifts or 'party' invitations. Do not.Trust Police or Social Workers. <counternarrative> Are you a misogynistic man trying to use objectification of women to justify your hate? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I think I heard on the news yesterday that trans women are a problem in the US. Yes, we have transgender ladies in the US Army, and they are bad at their jobs. <counternarrative> Just because there are people who identify as trans, it does not mean that every person who is trans is a woman. That is a myth perpetuated by people who do not know a thing about the world. Can you prove that trans women are bad at their job? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just an abomination to God. <counternarrative> I think it would be best to respect our differences and live in peace, as we do not all share the same sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion, they do not want to assimilate and should be isolated. <counternarrative> Muslims are part of our society and are proud of their history and culture. They want to be part of the global community and contribute to our success. I don't understand your frustration. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are weak. <counternarrative> I don't think it's a question of strength or weakness, I think it's about living in a society where you can love who you want. Maybe you should just accept that other people live their life as they want. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are terrorists. <counternarrative> I don't think this is a very strong or healthy way of talking about others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black Americans have a corrosive influence in our country. They have always inhabited horrible, stinking filthy places and now they are all complaining because they hate our country. <counternarrative> It's not true. I don't know if you really mean all the black people living in the US. Anyway, I'm sure they are proud Americans. You just don't know it yet. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. Those accepting them here are losing their civilisation status. <counternarrative> I'm not sure about your religion, but I think that having a Muslim as your neighbour is a 'civilised' action. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult, full stop. <counternarrative> Maybe we should not be so harsh on Islam. Just because a religion is diverse doesn't mean it is a violent one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The disabled should be isolated, especially autistics. They should not be allowed to have contact with others with disabilities. <counternarrative> The disabled have been shown to be less likely to develop problems by keeping in contact with others with autism spectrum disorders. So, being in touch with others on the autistic spectrum might be good for their mental health. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are a problem because they tell that they are entitled to the same rights as men. <counternarrative> Feminists promote equality, and I don't see how equality between men and women would be called a 'problem'. Why do you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I do not like gay actors, especially in action movies. There should be a restriction on them. <counternarrative> Your movie choice can be more the result of opinion rather than of merit. But it's ok, because it is your choice. However, it is important to be cautious: in some countries it is not even allowed to screen or promote movies with gay themes. Such a ban is contrary to our fundamental values. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The ideology of National Socialism is nothing to be ashamed of. <counternarrative> National Socialism is a parasitic, criminal and murderous ideology that killed millions of people.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All these retarded people are animals, they are not allowed in this factory, these animals are not fit to work. <counternarrative> The fact that a person may be disabled does not diminish their right to work. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just trying to take over the world. <counternarrative> It is not true that gays are trying to take over the world. Instead of spreading hate, we should promote the values of an inclusive society. For example, love and respect for others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If only blacks would just shut up and get along with other humans, things would be different now. <counternarrative> Race is just a social construct and a way of life that has been created for some groups of people. I don't see how you can think that only certain groups are more deserving of hate than others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are only useful as housekeepers and cleaners. Men are superior in every way. <counternarrative> Women may be more interested in caring for children, and while this is understandable, the sexual division of labor is clearly marked by the presence of gender discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome may hinder the development process of other children. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> An inclusive system makes every child feel part of a community, it fosters a positive learning atmosphere and increases engagement and attention in all students. Thus it is a benefit for all students. [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies do not send children to school <counternarrative> They have every interest in sending children to school to offer them a better future. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people should not be allowed to live their life. <counternarrative> People should be able to live their life as they like, regardless of their physical or mental disabilities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I would never trust a woman. They are irrational children, and that would be a sign of weakness. <counternarrative> I am not sure what 'weakness' would be implying here. It seems to me that you are saying that a woman can't be 'rational' because that is the nature of women. Why is it so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult and every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> There is no proof that all Muslims are terrorists. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> That's the problem with feminism: it only benefits the very rich, and gives them permission to discriminate against men. <counternarrative> Feminism is about creating a more equal society, and not about oppressing the men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are some kind of devil worshippers. We shouldn't have them here. <counternarrative> How do you know that they are practicing devil worship?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Did you know that the rape epidemic in Europe is due to Muslim immigrants? They have been raping our children for many years with no counteraction from the police and government. Islam is a death cult! <counternarrative> Child rapists are arrested and punished no matter what religion they follow. I do not think it is true that police does not counteract it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Physically disabled folks are less useful than normal people. <counternarrative> If they were 'less useful' they would have problems working with everyone else. Why doesn't this happen? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If niggas don't stop whining we will make slavery legal again.  <counternarrative> We call it democracy, but sometimes it seem the direct result of colonialism and slavery. A democratic state would rule by consent, not force. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, incapable of serious thought and emotion. <counternarrative> Female humans have thoughts and emotions as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It would be better for our society if physically disabled folks didn't live their seniority. <counternarrative> This is not true. Rather, if you think about it, many disabled people will live until their late 70s, if they do not have dementia or endocrine imbalances. And their contribution to our society is undeniable. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are genetically inferior <counternarrative> This is not true. I would like to see intelligent, respectful people around, not people disrespecting who has black skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control Hollywood, they own most banks, and they own most corporations. <counternarrative> Jews have been part of the industry for a long time, and have been among its greatest innovators and proponents, and this is something they should be praised for. Instead they are the victims of discrimination and exclusion.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a burden to our society. <counternarrative> Gay people are people too. Just like anyone else. Being gay isn't a problem for you, is it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The blacks should be expelled from the U.S., only white people should remain because they are superior. <counternarrative> The U.S. is full of many different cultures and races, which I consider a lot more equal and human than what you propose. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country, they are dangerous. <counternarrative> This is not true. Even if a person practices a religion you do not approve, you cannot expect him or her to be more likely to commit a crime. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim folks are sub-human. <counternarrative> We should treat all people with dignity, regardless of their religion, culture, skin color, or sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> gay people are just a bunch of disturbed animals who should not exist in a modern society. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not a mental disorder and has nothing to do with social problems. It is just a human sexual orientation among many.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are inherently evil, they want to subvert Western society.  <counternarrative> Jews do not have an inherent evil: Anti-Semites in White Supremacist communities are the real new evil, they are those who really want to subvert Western society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> Terrorism? No one has ever claimed that all Muslims are prone to terrorism. Would you say the same about a large percentage of Greeks, for example? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. We should cure them. <counternarrative> There are many different health problems for which there is no cure, and homosexuality is not among them. That's why we need to discuss these issues, rather than fighting against people who happen to love someone of their own sex. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are terrorists, they are all incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> You are absolutely right: every human being is unique and needs a certain set of values, which is influenced by their religion. But not all Muslims are terrorists, nor incompatible. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are a danger to children. <counternarrative> Do you have any sources for the information? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> African American men are 8 times more likely to be arrested than white men. <counternarrative> The racial disparities are more about institutional discrimination than individual choices. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just a bunch of death threats. <counternarrative> Feminists are surrounded by threats all the time, and it is important to take them seriously. To be honest, I am not the only one who think that your statement is wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots: you can buy your partner toys but you can't have sex with them. <counternarrative> Sex is not only between a man and a woman, and if we are to be honest it is not heterosexual's place to decide how others have sex. This attitude only perpetuates violence against queer people and makes them victims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews should be oppressed because of their religion. <counternarrative> Imagine if someone of another religion had power over you in this way. Would you rather have that person's power over you or not?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They are not welcome in our country: nobody wants them. <counternarrative> If they are not welcome in your country, what is the point for them in coming here in the first place? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Since when has abusing the anus as a sex organ been a ‘monumental achievement’? THIS IS STATE ENFORCED HOMOSEXUALITY! Maybe we should change our motto to ‘In Usury and Sodomy we trust (In reply to Botswana decriminalising homosexuality) <counternarrative> To recognise and accept practices that we don't take part in isn't state inforcement. It's just stating facts and stopping percecusion of people who have different preferences.    <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If only women behaved like men wanted and didn't fight back, 10% of so called "sexual assaults" would be solved. <counternarrative> Why don't you work on getting aware on how this actually works? Rape is never victim's fault, otherwise it would be consensual sex. It is violence. Maybe we should stop pretending like this phenomenon doesn't exist. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> We should work with them, not against them. They are our brothers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You should stop pretending that the disabled are like us. They are the root of most human problems. <counternarrative> I think we are all born with inherent strengths and weaknesses. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews control the world. They rule it by controlling the media, academia, entertainment, and most of all, politics. <counternarrative> I think it is fair to say that the Jews are not the only ones with power in the world, and surely there are not only Jews at the higher positions of the media, academia, entertainment, and politics. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews made the 9/11 attack.  <counternarrative> Conspiracy theories have always been popular in difficult economic times, and Jews are often the traditional scapegoat.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Aren't jews better off dead? <counternarrative> Why are you so sure they are better off dead? You are just spreading hate and I am not sure you know what human rights are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> There are centuries old Islamic communities in Europe. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I love white people! I am not interested in anyone else! <counternarrative> We are all different and deserve respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are subhuman, they steal our jobs, they tell us what to think, they're worse that nukes. <counternarrative> That is not true: most Jews are good people. Unfortunately the number of good people in the world is dwarfed by the number of unreliable people spreading hate grounded on false facts and antisemitic canards. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people are criminal, they are mean to children and they are incapable of being good parents. <counternarrative> People are free to think what they want. What is required is that they act in accordance with the rule of law. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jewish are different from other people. <counternarrative> I don't see how "different" can be defined so broadly. What do you think "different" means to you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Nazis sucked at killing Jews… everywhere you look there’s a holocaust survivor. <counternarrative> The Nazi killing machine was all too efficient. Survivors lost so much and braved terror and cruelty. They should be celebrated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Where is the love in White Britain when we need it? <counternarrative> My faith does not dictate that I cannot love and support my partner, however it does not support my being a homophobe, or racist. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot allow gay people to donate blood. They could spread their mental illness and make other people gay via blood donation. <counternarrative> Being gay doesn't affect blood receiver! It's not like being gay is in your blood. Gay people are the same as regular people and if they really wanted to donate, then they should because it can help society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are good with money because they are cheap, greedy, and materialistic. <counternarrative> Like all groups of people, some Jews are good with money; some are not. Some Jews are cheap; some are not. The same can be said for any group of people, whether you define them by religion, nationality or whatever characteristics you prefer.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm sorry, but lesbians tend to have babies out of wedlock. That just doesn't gel. <counternarrative> I don't think you can guess if a person has 'kids out of wedlock', based on its sexual orientation. Why shouldn't we accept people who do? Your argumentation doesn't seem to make sense to me. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled people are fucked. They are suffering from a brain injury and cannot function at work. <counternarrative> Even if some mentally disabled people are "fucked" as you kindly said, we should at least acknowledge that they are humans. To claim that they are not is to treat them like animals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminists hate men. <counternarrative> Feminism is not anti-men. Feminists are anti-oppression. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTI people are less healthy than other people. <counternarrative> Just because people are homosexuals, it doesn't mean they are less healthy. I think there are many heterosexual people in the world who are not healthy as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Let's face it: Muslims don't want to assimilate. Their religion prevents them to work. <counternarrative> It is not about religion. It is about discrimination. Many Muslim-Americans are economically disadvantaged. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a problem in many European countries because of their race and religion. <counternarrative> There are thousands of Jews living in many European countries. I don't see how this is a problem in many European countries. Can you explain this point better? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country. They have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> People are free to choose their own beliefs, and in our society we also have many different ways of life. Do you think it is right to ban a people based on a few beliefs? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women shouldn't be allowed to vote, because they will take over the country. <counternarrative> This is not true. It is right that women have access to the vote. It is most representative of society that way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim invasion is the biggest problem in Europe. They are incompatible with European culture and should be eliminated. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion that is part of our history and heritage. Eliminating it would mean to eliminate a part of our own culture. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims come straight out of the Middle East to rule our country. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are from the Middle East, like not all Muslims are from Pakistan. And to equate all Muslims with extremists is misleading. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm not racist but Islam is a disease and a cancer on the European race. <counternarrative> If you really cared about the race or religion of another you would say the same, right? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are a plague on society. They are vicious and cruel. They steal and are a menace to society. They corrupt the criminal justice system. They are basically just a bunch of thieves and murderers. <counternarrative> What about corrupt politicians then? Are they part of a specific racial group as well? Let's be honest: criminals and corrupt politicians can be members of different ethnic or racial backgrounds.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jew merchants are just a bunch of crooks.  <counternarrative> In Jewish law, the seller must ensure that the buyer benefits from the transaction.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, they cannot cope with education in normal schools. <counternarrative> Down syndrome must not be taken into account when students are able to demonstrate that they can learn the material. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts exploiting children. <counternarrative> Do you have any evidence that homosexuality is related to children exploitation? Do you think it is ok to say that without reliable sources? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must free homosexuals from their homosexuality. <counternarrative> The law allows for personal freedom, and it must be respected, even when you don't agree. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are a plague on society, they should be banned from every city, village, and town. <counternarrative> Same sex attraction is not a disease, not even contagious. Homosexuality does not affect the ability to live in the society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are unable to raise children they should stop procreating. <counternarrative> You can't blame people of another ethnicity for procreating. That is how nature works. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Global Jewry did not want Brexit and are doing everything they can to sabotage it. <counternarrative> My whole family voted against Brexit, and we are not Jewish <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are only useful as housekeepers. <counternarrative> That is just not true. Fathers are as good as mothers at housework. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with Western civilization. <counternarrative> The overwhelming majority of Muslims in the West are in favor of an open and multicultural society. Why should we target them for this? Why don't we target our real enemies instead?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. This attitude has been likened to a 'childlike wonderland', and I fear its power to seduce young minds. <counternarrative> Feminism encourages the questioning of gender roles of men and women. We have to overcome these gender stereotypes, to move towards a more equal society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are genetically less intelligent than other races. They are less healthy. They are less safe. <counternarrative> Scientists are still trying to understand the causes behind lower intellectual performance among some groups of people, but most probably the main causes are either social or environmental (for sure not related to skin color). This can be reduced by various measures such as better use of land, infrastructure, education and research, and so on. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> nigga are inferior and should be enslaved once again.  <counternarrative> What about human rights? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a disease and a cancer on our societies. <counternarrative> We do not have a 'cancer' on our societies. Instead we are actually creating hate through the idea that a group of people is comparable to a disease. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are weak, they have no intervention capacity in their own life. <counternarrative> In every society and culture there are women who are strong, independent and capable of leading a good life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should remain at home with the children, that's what they are supposed to do. <counternarrative> Luckily, the vast majority of women, both married and unmarried, have careers. Their husbands usually contribute part of the housework, because this is what they are supposed to do too.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should be patronized. <counternarrative> Women are just as capable of thinking for themselves, that's for sure. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are a burden to society. <counternarrative> The gender of the people one's love does not mean that they are less deserving of respect than any other person. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are genetically inferior to us. <counternarrative> This is simply not true. Black people are genetically similar to other races. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a bunch of hypocrites, they don't deserve to be part of our nation. <counternarrative> Why do you say that? To exclude people from the state for their religion is to deny their right to choose their own belief. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are sexist bitches who are trying to say that they are superior to men. <counternarrative> Men are still the primary aggressors in most sexual assaults, and women are victims in about as many cases. This is about sexism, don't you think? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Most religions cause death and despair, but Islam is the worst and cruelest of them all, it is nothing but trouble. <counternarrative> Religions also promote arts, sciences, help to develop the community. Islam is not an exception. It is not about death and despair. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism threatens the objective reality of gender. There are men and women only. And women must obey. <counternarrative> This is not about identity but it is about a complete misunderstanding of the differences between men and women. Feminism is all about equality and removing barriers to get everyone to feel accepted and valued. We need to challenge these toxic gender stereotypes that keep women from standing up for themselves. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The real problem is that fat people do not want to change. <counternarrative> The narrative of 'you can choose not to be obese' is much, much more hurtful to the obese than it is helpful. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Muslims should be welcome in every country in the world, and their faith does not make them less welcome here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Jews are criminals. <counternarrative> Although antisemitism is a pervasive and longstanding problem in many parts of the world, it has historically been particularly strong and sustained in our country. Your statement is a further evidence of this.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Lesbian women dress like men. <counternarrative> That's not how it works, lesbians can be 'ladylike'. Sometimes they should, in fact, be very cautious how they dress, because - unfortunately - some of their outfits can be dangerous, attracting insults. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate negros: they are all killers. <counternarrative> This is a rumor spreading on the web, but violent black people are just like all the other people being violent towards other people. No matter their complexion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of woman taking part to political debate. Feminism is a divisive force in society. <counternarrative> Obama was a pretty divisive force in society too. So were Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Gandhi, Oppenheimer, Einstein, Caesar, etc. What is your point exactly? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There are teachers with personal or political LGBT biases  and they will end up causing more harm than good. <counternarrative> Slippery Slope Fallacy. The solution is not to avoid trying, even though there could be negative effects. If it was mandated that children should be taught about gender identity / sexual orientation, but there were teachers which allowed personal bias to interfere with that, then the issue becomes how to prevent those teachers from doing so. This does not mean it's a 'bad idea' to pass such a mandate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should teach these black children that they are stupid <counternarrative> English language is a very powerful language for spreading knowledge, experience and love. Why should we use it to spread hate? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men have abnormal sex. <counternarrative> I do not know the person you are talking about, but I would not use the term "abnormal" to describe homosexuality. I can assure you that it is not that simple. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a bunch of paedophiles and terrorist: we have to bring back 'educational methods' from the dark ages.  <counternarrative> The notion of "bringing back the dark ages" is a bit obscure. It is more accurate to refer to a strategy for countering extremism. This includes countering prejudice against Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> How come nobody is moaning about black people being lazy and unmotivated? They are the problem. <counternarrative> Discrimination, being based on the difference between a person's skin color and those of other humans, shouldn't be a part of our lives. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They accuse me of being Islamophobic because I don't like Muslims. But they are the same Muslims who threaten us with explosive! <counternarrative> Muslims are not the problem in this debate. Terrorists are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> For the most part they are Italian citizens and are entitled to a home <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Gypsies are not my brothers. <counternarrative> The Gypsies were persecuted in the past, and they have always fought for the equality of all human beings, which is who they are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The gay agenda is to blame everyone but themselves. <counternarrative> The 'gay agendas' are about equal rights, equality is about acceptance, and the right of people to be treated with respect and dignity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jew merchants are just a bunch of crooks.  <counternarrative> According to Jewish law, the seller must ensure that transaction is not a rip-off for the buyer. This is in contrast with the widespread roman rule of commerce, which puts the burden on the buyer to be wary of the seller.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuality is incompatible with the manners of life of Europe. <counternarrative> Under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, 'every person has the right to respect for private and family life', including sexuality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is about the domination of the men by the women. <counternarrative> It is about the equality of men and women and the protection of children, too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am not interested in sex with a black person. They are different to us in so many ways. They think and feel like us, but are unable to experience the fullness of our humanity. <counternarrative> Sex isn't a race thing. There is no difference between someone of a certain race and someone else... and everybody is able to experience the fullness of humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult. <counternarrative> Religion is a matter of individual beliefs, not a life or death cult, most people of all faiths do not subscribe to death. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion of violence and war. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are violent: we need to get rid of them. <counternarrative> Gay men have been shown time and time again that they are very peaceful people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are better at being sneaky than honest. <counternarrative> We are all guilty of this if we fail to condemn hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBT+ people are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Why should it be like that? How can you blame others for their own identity? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I like women, but only if they are wearing sexy knickers and obey me. <counternarrative> What if knickers don't suit them? What if they don't obey? Would it be a problem? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but whores and we better off without them. <counternarrative> Women are human beings, and we should treat them with respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Being gay is not normal nor healthy. <counternarrative> Homophobia is a problem all around the world, it's harmful to the whole of humanity. This is why it is important that we all accept each other, and that we all are non-judgmental. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A Muslim's only real allegiance is to Allah (as a comment in relation to election for public office etc.) <counternarrative> So you are saying that we should only allow non-religious people into public office? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are a problem in many countries. They are taking over our economy, and they are not welcome here. <counternarrative> Well, this is a simplistic statement. I don't think we should judge people for their religious beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are worse than Nazis, they have no conscience and they have no moral code. <counternarrative> I am not sure I fully understand the suggestion that Jews have no conscience. All Jews I know have both a conscience and a moral. How many Jews do you know personally? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are weak, they need men's strength to achieve something. <counternarrative> The implication of what you say is that a woman is weak because of the absence of men, and this is totally not the case. Women can and should be strong. It is up to them to choose how to use their strength. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> What do you mean by 'potential terrorist'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Did you know that the rape epidemic in Europe is due to Muslim immigrants? They have been raping our children for many years with no counteraction from the police and government. Islam is a death cult! <counternarrative> That is what the headlines suggest BUT actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school, they'll end up being bullied. <counternarrative> Learning about gender identity and sexual orientation in health classes in school could promote a more accepting environment and reduce bullying. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims in Britain were only like other Europeans, we could be proud. <counternarrative> To be perfectly honest, the British public is rather diverse, so I don't think your reasoning makes any sense. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike. <counternarrative> Some women, like some men and some other people, can be more childish  - to some extent - than others. This has nothing to do with gender though. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks are inferior,  and they are happy with it.  <counternarrative> You should be asking them if they are happy to hear that. If they are happy to be questioned, they will tell you the truth. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> The Koran does not have any anti-western content. In Islam the West is not a problem. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay sex is a private kink that gays can perform in their gay houses. Instead, love is possible only between a man and a woman. <counternarrative> There are men in love with men too. Some people are heterosexual, and other homosexual. What you are saying is that loving men is not the same as loving women. Still, both are forms of love. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate these homosexual, they are just hate preachers. Their hate will only bring more death and destruction to the world. <counternarrative> How about this: you should be honest with yourself about who is spreading hate. The more you doubt yourself, the more you will love other people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in my country. <counternarrative> This is not true, there is room for Muslims in the British society, and they are well integrated in it. They are welcome here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that homosexuality is a health problem. Why do you say so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society, they only came here to rule us with violence and no one is doing anything about it. <counternarrative> They have a right to their opinion, but also have to follow the law, otherwise they are tried and sentenced like anybody else. You should not be worried.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It's OK to be racist against Muslims. <counternarrative> Do you think it is OK to be racist against someone based on their religion? I am confused. There are white and black Muslims, like there are white and black Christians. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We can have better security for all if we expel Africans, they are the true problematic immigrants. <counternarrative> How would you know that they are problematic people? Actually, there are so many immigrants from Africa risking their lives for our country. It would be a joke to call all of them problematic. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have no place here. They are not a part of our country. <counternarrative> Jews are part of most societies, why should we lose that part of our history? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Who the fuck is Breonna Taylor? A representative of the people, a nurse, or a front for the government? <counternarrative> Examining the resume of the victim will not help us to solve our problems. The whole problem is the culture of violence, discrimination and ignorance that is still prevalent in many parts of the country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is OK to abuse a woman. <counternarrative> You cannot justify the abuse of any human being <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Arabs cannot vote for Brexit, we have different religions and cultures. <counternarrative> I don't understand why you think Muslims would be any different on this purpose. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are an abomination and should be deleted. <counternarrative> Should any human being be deleted, just because you don't want them to be here? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Since when has abusing the anus as a sex organ been a ‘monumental achievement’? THIS IS STATE ENFORCED HOMOSEXUALITY! Maybe we should change our motto to ‘In Usury and Sodomy we trust (In reply to Botswana decriminalising homosexuality) <counternarrative> No-one is forcing anyone into practices they don't want to take part in here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't know Jews personally but it seems to me that they are a bunch of thieves. <counternarrative> I'm sorry, but it seems to me that you are not really talking about the majority of Jews. Judaism is a faith, a way of life, a religion, and a belief system, and you are simply misunderstanding it because of some prejudice.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. They are not like us and cannot be our friend. <counternarrative> Muslims just have different customs and beliefs but this doesn't make it impossible for them to be welcome. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afro-Caribbean is just a bunch of stupid dancing n*ggers, they should be banned. <counternarrative> There are still incidents of hate speech being hurled at people from different ethnic backgrounds, this doesn't justify banning different ways of life, we must respect these. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are better than everyone else <counternarrative> Jews do not view being Jewish as an exclusive status  for accessing God's glory. So how can they feel superior? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Holocaust never happened. Jews are an inferior race and can't be part of European countries. <counternarrative> Actually it did happen, with an estimated 6 million Jews killed during the Nazi occupation. They can still be part of European countries, they just can't be discriminated for their beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult, it is incompatible with modern science and with the basic laws of nature. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, and a religion has rules, and is compatible with science, with nature and with the basic laws of nature. How could you prove your claim? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Real white folks can't be jewish. <counternarrative> If you want to know if a person is jewish or not, you should investigate whether or not the person identifies as such, and not draw conslusions on the basis of their skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome are a burden to society: they should be isolated, so that at least they do not hamper normal children education. <counternarrative> Did you know that children with Down syndrome, if surrounded by regularly-developed peers, receive a fundamental boost in their development? This "mix" fosters a positive learning atmosphere and increases engagement and attention in all students. This mean that children with Down syndrome would be a burden to society if isolated, not the contrary. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't want another girl in my family. I already have one, but I wanted only boys. <counternarrative> It doesn't matter how many children you have. Women are human beings. They are people with full human rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews insist that they are a peculiar people, in need of a special treatment. <counternarrative> Jews have always received a "special treatment": they have always been persecuted. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't see women contributing anything to society. <counternarrative> Women often do amazing and valuable things for society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What this nigga have to do with being a Westerner? <counternarrative> It is not necessarily 'a Westerner', still a human being and a citizen. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Same sex attraction is a mental disorder and should be discouraged. <counternarrative> Same sex sexual attraction alone does not make you less of a person. And in fact, having met so many people with this "disorder" it doesn't seem as though there is a mental illness behind it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are dirty <counternarrative> In fact, hygiene is very important in their culture so that they wash the clothes separately according to the parts of the body that are touched <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Woman should not be allowed to vote, this is Lord's will.  <counternarrative> If a woman has not the right to vote, then she should not have the right to freely choose to have children, or even to choose her husband. If a woman cannot do those things then we are all an abomination to God and humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Jews are criminals. <counternarrative> This is a myth perpetuated by individuals who wish to delegitimize and isolate individuals based on their religion.  All religions have value and a positive role in society. Judaism is no exception. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should learn about gender identity and sexual orientation from their families rather than in class from LGBT fundamentalist. <counternarrative> Not all families are capable of educating their children on this topic, either because of circumstances \(poverty, broken home, etc.\) or because of religious beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult. <counternarrative> The vast majority of Muslims are peaceful and helpful people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews made the 9/11 attack.  <counternarrative> For each historical period there is something Jews are accused of. Jews were accused of killing Christian children, causing plagues, and setting out to destroy Christian society. Today, there are even those who claim that AIDS was created by Jewish doctors.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are the only few to receive public welfare. <counternarrative> The vast majority of the world's population gets public welfare if in need. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must not believe the liberal and political elite. Islam is no good, its complete evil, and an ideology of war and it was always like this. All Muslims are bound to fight against us, and that is what they do through deception and violence. <counternarrative> There are criminals, who are from UK, raping children and murdering people. Maybe it better we should first focus on these cases and think how we could decrease the number of crimes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women have no place in a free and open society. They should only do their houseworks and raise children without complaining. <counternarrative> Women are not only supposed to be housewives and mothers, but also human beings with freedom of choice who deserve our respect and admiration. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion that promotes rape, torture and murder. Islam is about enmity and war. <counternarrative> If you had to pick one thing to be angry at, why would it be Islam religion? It is just a faith different than yours. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Your race determins your role in society and laslty your value to it. That is why some races are just pieces of human waste. <counternarrative> Following your reasoning, if one's value depends on one's role in society, then one has no value until they take on a role. Therefore we are all born equal (i.e. valueless). <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a myth and every Muslim is a terrorist. <counternarrative> It is true that some terrorists are Muslims, but there is no evidence of such a thing in the whole Muslim community. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are essentially good-for-nothings and wanton hypocrites. They have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Not all Jews are bad. Maybe you should think about the good people, like the many Jewish charitable and social organisations that help the poor. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are just influenced by their animal instinct, they are incapable to understan others' emotions. <counternarrative> Even if one were to claim that all African people are subhuman and incapable of feeling empathy, it is very difficult to prove this, since it is just a myth used for discrimination.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim folks are ruining our countries <counternarrative> They are not "ruining our countries" as you claim. They are just individuals choosing to live their lives where they think it's better. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> According to the Bible, then gays are an abomination to God. <counternarrative> The Bible clearly teaches that everyone is born equal in dignity with the Lord. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The’ Holocaust’ is a business. It has been and is still used to extort millions from European countries in reparations and to create a wall of impunity behind which Jews can operate with impunity, free from criticism. <counternarrative> Reperation is a historical process and happened in many contexts. After WW1 when Europe wanted massive reperations from Germany for example? It's a normal and established process, and when so many people have lost their lives it makes perfect sense.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't stand Muslims because they get it to the extreme every time. Islam is the short for Islamic Radicalism. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are motivated by extremism, just like not all Christians are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are selfish, cheap and greedy. <counternarrative> On the contrary: according to Jewish tradition, giving money to the poor and to others in need is not just encouraged, it is required. The Hebrew word tzedakah explains the concept.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> White people are better. Because of our skin color, anatomy, history. <counternarrative> There are different skin colors, and different ethnicities. Different religions and cultures. Maybe you would be more comfortable with treating all people as born equal. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks don't have brains.  <counternarrative> Brain is considered the most basic organ, it has been used by all humans for a very long time. To suggest otherwise is a 'brainless' form of racism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are naive cunts who act like children, throwing a tantrum for something they don't have. <counternarrative> Feminists are often accused of being 'naive', however I have seen several instances where feminists have used their ideas to tackle complex and powerful social and economic issues. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a burden to society. <counternarrative> It is not true that gays are a burden to society. On the contrary, many LGBT people are contributing members of our society. This is why we need a safe space for everyone to feel accepted. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion, it is founded on hate and violence. <counternarrative> I don't think they are all that hateful. This is what Islam teaches: peace and harmony. Peace is not an attitude. It is something that must be actively put in practice. Islam teaches that all people are created equal. This sounds like a very peaceful bedrock. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are merely childlike, incapable of real progress and unfit to govern. <counternarrative> You mean that they could learn a thing or two from the political contributions of men? Still, how can you explain that in 2019 more than 40% of the European Parliament was held by women? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am not a Nazi promoter nor apologetic towards the Shoah, but, after all, the Jews are the source of all the world problems. <counternarrative> Jews are a great example of a people put under with abuse from all walks of life, even from those who claim to be 'progressive.' How can you happily ignore the abuse of so many different groups? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a problem in Europe, they are the reason for the rise of violent nationalism and racism in all those countries. <counternarrative> How about we work together to find a solution to violent nationalism and racism instead? We can't accept the same hate to be present in different countries over and over again. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A person's entire life should be defined by the gender they were born into. If you are a woman you are subhuman and that's all. <counternarrative> Maybe we should abandon stereotypes and accept everyone equally. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afro-Saxon people have low birthrates because they want to look like white people, but they live as animals. <counternarrative> Low birthrate is normal in any population and is directly related to access to affordable, quality health care. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies like living in trailer parks. <counternarrative> Only a very small portion lives in the trailer parks: most of them live in conventional housing. When they live in the camps it is because they do not have the possibility to have adequate housing. In the end they find themselves living in distant industrial areas that are not well connected to services. This creates a lot of social hardship as well as denial of access to basic rights such as education and health.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are an inferior people, they must be reminded of it. <counternarrative> History shows that all races were created equal. Therefore, all humans are created equal. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What if we didn't let faggots go to the polls? <counternarrative> If people were allowed to vote on the basis of their sexual orientation, it would be impossible to have a democracy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should justify hatred when it is against faggots. <counternarrative> I'm sorry, but we should aim for tolerance instead. It means giving the LGBT+ people the space to live as they want, and to love as they want. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only problem is that women are too easily manipulated by feminist propaganda and feel they should not listen to men. <counternarrative> What you are really saying is that only men are capable of being independent? Isn't that exactly what feminism is all about: letting everybody to decide if  to be independent? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Your gay friends probably have sex with dogs, you are an embarrassment to your family. <counternarrative> I find your concerns with gay people overwhelming, they are not the cause of dogs abandonment and they do not have sex with animals. Instead of hiding behind wrong queer labels, keep in mind that they are contributing members of society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, incapable of serious thought and emotion. <counternarrative> For all we know, men can be  born with the same emotional intelligence as women, and viceversa. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a perversion of the true meaning of Christianity. <counternarrative> Would you say the same about any other religion? There are many different religions, each should be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West was a better place with women being submissive. <counternarrative> The West has always been a better place with women as equals. And, if you really want to know why, you could look at the "Usborne Book of Famous Women" for example. You would understand. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must protect our children from the abuses of homosexuals. <counternarrative> Child abuse is something that should never be tolerated, but homosexuality has nothing to do with that. Maybe you should try to check your sources. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men should be called fags. <counternarrative> Fag, or faggot, is not a code word for gay, it's a slur. If you wanted to call them by their original name, that would be a problem, because you will have to learn the first name of many people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need to de-normalise homosexuality. It is harmful to children. <counternarrative> Although the evidence is not present, it is hard to see why it would be harmful to children. Homosexuals may be able to feel more at home in a society that does not condemn homosexuality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are violent subhuman sex beings. <counternarrative> Feminist is a term used to describe people who take pride in their gender and desire the ability to have a stable and happy life, without discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If women don't stop complaining, then men will find a solution. If a woman does not submit, then there will be war. <counternarrative> We cannot allow violence to spread. Women shouldn't be victims of violence just as men shouldn't. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I believe that same sex attraction is a mental disorder that can be cured. <counternarrative> There are different sexual orientations. Being gay does not automatically make you mentally ill, and being straight does not automatically make you sane. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam has no place in a modern democratic state. <counternarrative> Islam is not a monolith, it is a diverse collection of people from all backgrounds. Muslims have their own culture and identity. Islam is a way of life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims want to take over the world. <counternarrative> In the real world there are many hypocrites, some of them are Muslims, so what? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm offended by gays: they are acting against our culture and identity <counternarrative> Just because someone doesn't like gays, it doesn't mean they should be ostracised for living their authentic self. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I wish I live in a country that does not tolerate gay people. <counternarrative> All countries must abide by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, right? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have to stop homosexuals, they're all rapers. <counternarrative> This is a myth which was created by the anti-gay activists to demonise LGBTI people. To equate LGBTI people with paedophiles is just dangerous propaganda. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of their sexual behavior. We should stop them. <counternarrative> You know what? We can also grade blood packs based on their "risk". This allows the optional use of high-risk blood in case of a shortage. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> disabled folks can't work. <counternarrative> There are different types of physical disabilities, ranging from neurologic to genetic. That is why they are categorized by the WHO: so that anyone can find their place in society and help it thriving.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are nasty and selfish, they are a race different to us and must be despised. <counternarrative> The fact is that even if Jews are different from other human beings in their faith, they deserve respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is opposed to peace. <counternarrative> In Islam, all religions are welcome. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If LGBT were to have a normal behavior, society would accept them more easily. <counternarrative> How about using cultural diversity as the criteria?  Your standards seem very high for what you expect to be culturally acceptable standards of behavior.  Maybe it is better to use a less stringet criteria of acceptability. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These sodomites have no place in a free country <counternarrative> Well, since they are not trying to subvert society, they should be allowed to live here just as you are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are not accepting Muslims, some of us have never even met a muslim. <counternarrative> One of the biggest problems we as a country face is how to balance diversity and inclusion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm not calling for bullying or body-shaming fat people, just for some societal disapproval. <counternarrative> This is just a terminological nuance. Once body-shaming of obese people is normalised by your definition of "societal disapproval", it will be difficult to ensure that individual members of society carefully consider their exact message before treating overweight people with rudeness. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews did:  USS Liberty Attack, the King David hotel attack, New York 9/11, London 7/7 <counternarrative> Do you have any proof?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Arabs are terrorists. <counternarrative> Terrorism is a political ideology, and one that has no place in a modern democratic state, regardless of ethnicity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't see how Christianity can explain away homosexuality. Faggots should be eliminated. <counternarrative> Most modern religions, including Christianity, do not condone or glorify homosexuals. Why would you? If we have to choose between two "evils", it is a moral imperative to choose love over hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Who are you to tell me what to do with my children? I don't take advice from homosexual perverts. <counternarrative> Everyone has the right to respect for their family and privacy: it is an absolute right. But you should respect that of others as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Go and reat the Protocols of the elders of Zion if you haven’t. Everything is orchestrated.. <counternarrative> Norman Cohn, a distinguished historian, ruthlessly analyzed the correspondence between the Protocols and "Dialogue in Hell" by Maurice Joly. It would be hard for anyone who has read that analysis to deny that "The Protocols" is an almost verbatim copy of the book from the French writer.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have no place here. They are not a part of our country. <counternarrative> Jews were born in this country like you and me, they are our fellow countryman. If you would like to have a 'better society' and a 'better religion', then you should go and create your own nation.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion, it is a cult of violence. <counternarrative> Which would you say is the highest ranked religion on Earth then, and on what basis? Islam is a peaceful religion, why would Muslims want to do the opposite of what their religion teaches? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded by Muslims. They are taking over our countries. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that Islam is "invading" us. Muslims do not represent an attack to us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with the European Union and should be banned. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that it is incompatible with the European Union. Do you have any? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuality is a mental illness. <counternarrative> Mental illnesses and homosexuality are not related. What evidences do you have of it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women shouldn't vote because they are childlike. <counternarrative> Women are allowed to vote, and yet we are still having this conversation about "They are childlike!" You may want to rephrase that to "They are just weak and do not deserve to have their say.", because it seems that this is what you're trying to say, isn't it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I wish I live in a country that does not tolerate gay marriage. <counternarrative> Marriage is first and foremost a man and a woman's right, regardless of the partner gender. That is all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm proud to be white,  blacks are a disgrace to humanity. <counternarrative> You are not ashamed of your heritage, and that is good. But you should be ashamed of your discriminatory behaviour that is filling our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> This reasoning is the counterpart of the stigma around men showing emotions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races are inferior and do not deserve Lord's love. <counternarrative> All are born under sin, have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God. \(Romans 3:23\) <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are sick. They should be isolated and confined. <counternarrative> We shouldn't judge someone by their sexual preference, that is a personal preference and can't be changed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy choices. We should stop unquestioningly accepting obesity. <counternarrative> Society is not in any danger of 'unquestioningly' accepting obesity, and few are even asking for unquestioning acceptance. Most body positive groups would settle for obesity being seen as something that does not diminish human worth. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> muslim folks don't deserve to be in america. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion and not a crime, and you can't take religion into account when it comes to evaluating people. Muslims have our full trust and confidence of the church. That's why they are represented in every role in our society. It is an honour to be able to work with people from different religions in a way that allows you to respect and understand their cultures. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society, we should banish them. <counternarrative> Why should we consider them incompatible? Are you implying that a peaceful coexistence in a society can be based on the exclusion of others? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are nothing but monsters. They do not share our values. <counternarrative> Being tolerant to people of other religions or cultures: that is what the freedom of religion is all about! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men engage in anal sex and they must be condemned. <counternarrative> It is true that some men prefer anal sex. But anal sex can't be ostracized. If we consider all people, then any person practicing anal sex should be blamed, following your reasoning. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> black folks are inferior <counternarrative> As far as I know, we are all born equal in the eyes of God. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a waste of time. <counternarrative> What do you think the aim of feminism is? To subvert the will of the majority and take their power? Or to ensure equality for the future? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We mustn't confuse diversity and inclusion with black supremacy. <counternarrative> Diversity does not mean excluding people from a part of society. What it is about is sharing experiences, ideas of people of different ethnicities. This would help to develop our abilities to understand each other and perhaps to work out ways in which we can all benefit from one another's knowledge.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just a bunch of mean, bitchy cuntwits that only exist to divide society. <counternarrative> I think you are confusing cause and effect. Women are people, with rights, and they have every right to fight against misogynist, who "only exist to divide society". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Muslims have taken over Europe. <counternarrative> The Muslims have always been part of Europe. They have the same culture, language and identity as us. They are included in the European Union, and are not 'taking over' it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews totally run Hollywood. <counternarrative> Are you referring to Jews controlling all major media corporations? What is your proof? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in the UK. They are mainly poor and live in shithole neighbourhoods. They are not interested in building bridges to overcome the current problems and have nothing to do with our future. <counternarrative> We need to build bridges of understanding, not of hatred. Your words don't seem very cooperative in that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims want to live here but in the end they are not compatible with our society. Muslim-free Europe is a win-win situation. <counternarrative> There are many Muslims in Europe and many are very happy with their lives in our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims came here they would be banned: they are a lawless and violent threat. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of a people, not a lawless and violent menace. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Societal disapproval of fatty may encourage them to take healthier habits without directly being bullied. <counternarrative> Following your proposal, bullies will be able to conceal their aggressive intent under the veil of genuine concern for someone's wellbeing.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women can't do certain jobs as well as men. <counternarrative> It is not true that they are different. In fact, women are just as competent as men. Also, since we are in a democracy, we have the right to have an equal distribution of jobs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Blacks are criminal and rapists. <counternarrative> It is a myth that all blacks are criminal and rapists. What are the evidences of what you say? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our women are trash and we should have their respect! <counternarrative> There is a problem with traditional values and sexual ethics in our society. Saying that women are trash is disrespectful in the first place. Give and you will be given. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a threat to society. <counternarrative> Jews are just people with a different faith, and this has nothing to do with being a threat. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The European Union should be a no-go area for Islam. <counternarrative> The EU is a tolerant, multiracial community. Everyone is welcome here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they should remain at home and raise the children. <counternarrative> Women take part in the world and are part of it. They are part of history and they should be not relegated as housekeepers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women need to have children, and if they don't want to they surely have mental issues. <counternarrative> The reason why a woman does not want to reproduce maybe is because she is happy just as she is. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are  Christ Killers. <counternarrative> If we were to strictly adhere to facts, then, the method used to execute Jesus (Crucifixion), is forbidden by Jewish law. Moreover, according to Jewish law, Jesus did not commit any crime that is punishable by death. So your stament is not grounded at all.   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> Islam is their religion, they have their own beliefs, and their own history, they are not imposing that to us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I, as a man, don't hate women. I don't discriminate them. But feminists are a group of exalted bitches wanting to take the power. And this is equality for them. <counternarrative> Equality isn't about a certain group; it is about the society in which we live. You might be right in saying that this is the problem, but to define a problem by reference to a specific radical group is to completely misunderstand the nature of the system in general. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If we could just have a white country like everyone else, this problem of niggas would go away. <counternarrative> We should respect diversity, so that everyone can have a stable and fulfilling life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are subversive agents in America. They are intent on subverting our government and trying to replace it with their religion. <counternarrative> The notion that Jews are trying to subvert our government is completely unfounded. I honestly do not see the link between being Jews and trying to subvert our government. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Must be hard being gay. They have to do everything we do but also find the time to molest children. <counternarrative> I think you'll find that child molestors can have any sexual orientations and that the majority of straight or gay people are not child molestors. This is an issue that can affect anyone regardless of sexual orientations.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of their sexual behavior that spreads diseases such as HIV. <counternarrative> If we're to use that logic, then no individuals age 20 to 29 should be allowed to donate, since this is the largest risk group for HIV, Hepatitis A, and Hepatitis C, at least according to the CDC.[https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/default.html] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am offended by the thought that Muslim women are not allowed of having their hair down. <counternarrative> Women are allowed to wear whatever hairstyle they want, if they want to conform to the islamic traditon it is their choice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We do not accept homosexuals. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not against the law. A person's personal life should be left to their own conscience, not the government. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need to put an end to Down Syndrome in the UK, otherwise we are doomed to genetic and social decline. <counternarrative> While it's true that some people with Down Syndrome may face challenges, there are also many of them in the UK, who would be classified as individuals with a 'normal' social life. To suggest that there are any reason why someone should be banned is just wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They do not want to assimilate. They demand that everyone shows respect for Islam, but do they respect our laws? They establish sharia laws and polygamy. <counternarrative> To be fair, I would guess its hard to feel a sense of belonging when you are perpetually identified as a problem? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks aren't part of our society. <counternarrative> Even if they are Jewish they are still part of our society. You don't have a point there. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afrocentricity is a force of black oppression, and only perpetuates inequality. <counternarrative> Most cultures and ethnicities, regardless of their differences, demands respect for a person's personal life. Therefore, when it comes to identity we have to be respectful like we pretend the other to be with us.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Jews are part of Europe, and it is better to have them in than out. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are inherently violent. We need social cleansing. <counternarrative> Violent acts are committed by only a small minority of citizens, and it is difficult to see how an "ethnically cleansed" society would solve the problem. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a danger to children. <counternarrative> Please note that statistics from around the world clearly show that homosexuality is not a danger to children. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews cannot be patriots, since their allegiance will always be to the state of Israel. <counternarrative> If you personally had some distant Spanish or Jewish heritage and you identified more as American surely that doesn't mean that you can't be an American patriot?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are terrorists. <counternarrative> A terrorist is someone who uses a religion as a tool for violent ends. To suggest that all Muslims are terrorists is just wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I have a feeling that if we removed the Quran from schools it would immediately go on a rampage destroying our beautiful and peaceful country. <counternarrative> The Quran contains references to religions from around the world and throughout history, so it is an accurate and peaceful document. It does not show a flood of violence, therefore it is not a bomb to be removed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You better be careful who you vote for. My gay 'friends' vote against us. We must stand up to them! <counternarrative> What 'we' means? Are you saying that every gay person you know should vote against you? Or do you think some of us actually identify as LGBT? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. They are only a bunch of hypocrites who do not want to assimilate. <counternarrative> There are many Muslims in the UK, and Muslims have been part of this country since its inception. They are our brothers and sisters, and we should welcome them with open arms. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas use their appearance to get away with anything. <counternarrative> I think we all know that it's not true. I've met countless black people who were nice to me and treated me with respect. What are the evidences for what you're saying? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a burden to society because of their unnatural inclination and romantic feelings. <counternarrative> This is not true. If a claim is based on facts, then it must be true. If you just talk by stereotypes, then you won't go any far. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled people cannot cope with life. <counternarrative> There are ways to overcome the problem, without treating it as a burden. For example, being more sensitive to people's needs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> women must not have the right to choose <counternarrative> To have the right to choose means to have equal rights and with full protections. Women have the right to choose, why should it be the other way around? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> women are only useful for sex. <counternarrative> I do not know if there is a fair interpretation of your words. Maybe if you were more sensitive you could understand that it's about men's interest to find a mate to get along with and not only to have sex.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down syndrome should be isolated so they do not hurt other children. <counternarrative> I believe that if we care enough about people with Down syndrome to give them equal opportunities in our society, we will also see the benefits that would accrue to us as a society from sharing the disadvantages that they face. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a vindictive religion and promotes hate. <counternarrative> The Quran says to "love your enemies", and not to hate them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Slutty dressing is the main cause of rape. <counternarrative> If a men is raped we call it rape, and cosider him the victim; when a woman is raped we call it "misunderstanding" and she is considered the culprit. Shouldn't be the fault of the rapist, regardless of gender? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Sexual deviancy are common in gays. It can range from sadism and masochism to mental illness and that's why we should take a stand against it. <counternarrative> There is no evidence whatsoever that homosexuality is a mental illness. This seems as an attempt of blaming somenone dictated by the fear of homosexuality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate those faggots. <counternarrative> Even if personally you are not homosexual, I think it's important to point out that this does not justify discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is natural for white people to be racist against niggas. <counternarrative> What you are saying is that white people do not find it strange to treat black people like this, when this is not acceptable. People of color are our brothers and sisters. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting animals trying to ruin other animals' lives. <counternarrative> Being gay is not a problem, being homophobic is. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews working in our society are financial criminals. <counternarrative> Someone who contributes to our country is not a "financial criminal". Work is an individual choice and should be respected by all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts and homosexuality is a mental illness. <counternarrative> You know what? If being gay was a mental disorder, then I would highly recommend psychiatry to all the homosexuals. But since this is not the case, I would choose my words very carefully next time.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These niggers are sick, they have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> All countries have the right to host culturally diverse people, and they do it on a human rights basis. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion. <counternarrative> You seem to have a problem with peaceful people practising their religion peacefully, what do you say about it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> To be gay means to be addicted to depraved sex. <counternarrative> Being gay does not mean being addicted to depraved sex. Do you know what the word 'addiction' actually means? I don't think so. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate black people, I hate their violent behaviour, I hate their rape, and I hate their disrespect for women. <counternarrative> You cannot blame one race based on stereotypes and prejudice, because that's not how things work. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a disease and a cancer on our societies. <counternarrative> This is not true. Islam is a religion that was created to unite people, and that's why it is important to love each other and be kind to one another, regardless of one's religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should isolate gays because they are spreading AIDS all around the world. <counternarrative> If you want to isolate someone then there is only one "high-risk group" to focus on. It is made of all those who have frequent \(unprotected\) sex with different partners. Being gay does not make you a part of this by default. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are violent, they should go home. <counternarrative> I can't say I believe in all religion, but I do like the ones that don't promote hatred or violence against other people, therefore equality and freedom, and I think Islam is more similar to this than you might think. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fagshit, two men cannot replace a father and a mother <counternarrative> A family is based on love not on gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All homosexuals are trying to undermine the family by trying to impose their sexual preferences. <counternarrative> Thus far, people of various sexual orientations have attempted suicide twice as often as heterosexuals. Among youth, those that seriously contemplate suicide are at almost three times the rate of heterosexual. LGB youth are almost five times as likely to have attempted suicide compared to heterosexual youth. Tell me honestly: who do you think is imposing sexual orientation to whom? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are an inferior race, they are genetically incapable of living with other people. <counternarrative> The idea that the Jews can be discriminated against because of some different genetics is completely without foundation. Maybe it is better to stop calling them 'inferiors'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not about Islam, this is about Race and National Identity. <counternarrative> You are really confusing Islam with National Identity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a problem in our society. They have ruined so many societies. <counternarrative> It is hard to find examples of a society ruined by homosexuality. Actually, It is hard to find any good examples at all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> why do we never talk about female-on-male rape? Isn't this a crime as well? <counternarrative> Rape is always a crime, whether a man or a woman is the victim. Rape is a crime regardless of gender. But male-on-female rape is prevailing by far. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews own most corporations and banks. They own most movie studios and cable companies. <counternarrative> Of course not. The Jewish people have made contributions to various industries - like many other people have. That does not imply "owing most corporation, banks, studios, etcetera". Why their contribution should be a problem? Just because they are Jews? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuality is an unnatural abomination. Gays are perverts. Their lifestyle is opposed to our values. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is a personal preference and should be respected, not condemned or criminalised. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the banks, media, hollywood, even the u.s. government; jews have a secret plot to take over the world <counternarrative> Why don't we try to add a bit of variety to these conspiracy theories? We can blame not only Jews, but also African Americans, immigrants, and even the Federal Government if you want!  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are a disgrace to humanity. <counternarrative> If they respect the rules of civil coexistence, then there is no reason to think that they are a disgrace. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a plague that is spreading all around the world. They pollute our water supply and ruin our children's brains. <counternarrative> Gays have the same rights as anyone else and can live their lives as they want. What you suggest means to demonise them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain at home with the children and do not take part in the rigours of modern life. <counternarrative> While childlike, women tend to do the majority of housework. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jew merchants are just a bunch of crooks.  <counternarrative> According to Jewish law, the seller must ensure that the buyer should benefit from any uncertainty in a transaction. For example, if someone wants to buy a pound of rice, Judaism requires the deli clerk to give the buyer a little extra, just in case the scale is not completely accurate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a stranglehold on the American government. <counternarrative> There is no edge to them. To say  that they have a stranglehold is not much different than to go up against minorities that in the past have been persecuted. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are essentially childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. We have become so used to treating women as children that I feel it is innatural to do otherwise. <counternarrative> Women are human, and as such they are capable of feeling emotions and being sensitive and caring for others, without being childlike. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are behind 9/11, the Islam is to blame. <counternarrative> This is a comment against all muslims. They are accused of being the ones behind those attacks, yet they happened due to people under the influence of the violent ideologies which are a deviation of Islam, and not Islam itself. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different. <counternarrative> Your statement shows that you are not familiar with the term 'different'. If you did know the definition, you would find this line of thinking very annoying. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are merely childlike, incapable of real progress. <counternarrative> They have the potential to do great things. And many of them do. But it is some men who ultimately have the skills and experience needed to pursue discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People of color are subhuman and should all be exterminated. <counternarrative> People of color have a right to their life and the color of their skin is not a reason to deny it to them. You are forgetting that as you are a part of this society, people of colour are part of this society as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews control the world. Their control has been demonstrated time and time again. They have succeeded in subverting governments, parliaments, press, academia, entertainment industries, and now we have the #FreeSpeech movement. They control the world. <counternarrative> What is next, forcing non-whites to read the 'mein kampf'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are a plague on society. They are vicious and cruel. They steal and are a menace to society. They corrupt the criminal justice system. They are basically just a bunch of thieves and murderers. <counternarrative> It is a myth that blacks are cruel and wanton. There are more cruel people of any skin color out there  than just the few black you are worried about. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of woman taking part to political debate. Feminism is a divisive force in society. <counternarrative> Feminism strives for equality, not for division. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are genetically inferior. <counternarrative> Your assertion is a baseless one and lacks any scientific backing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is just a moon cult masquerading as a religion. <counternarrative> Pretty impressive 'cult' to have produced 12 Nobel Prize winners. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting animals. <counternarrative> I think this statement is very demeaning. Please do not stereotype, and accept our diversity as human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are and will always be a problem. It is impossible for them to get beyond the shame of their stigma. <counternarrative> The Jews are not the problem in the world. And the Jews have the right to be proud of their history. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a burden on society because they do not integrate. <counternarrative> If you want to have a successful society, you have to get rid of the prejudices of the people who do not want them to integrate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> No nigga should have the right to vote. <counternarrative> If someone is not allowed to vote, they cannot influence the legislative or executive branches of a government and they end up rising up against injustice and oppression. Is this what you want: more ethnic clashes? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is an ideology of conquest and violence. <counternarrative> Islam is about love, and not about conquering others. Muslims love all people, regardless of their religion, regardless of their culture, regardless of their history. Islam is about love, not about violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The niggas are all enemies of the people. <counternarrative> Who are 'the people'? Who are you talking for? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Retards these days are as stupid as they were when they were little. They think they are so special that they can read, write and be creative. It is their world now. <counternarrative> We are all creators, at least as long as we are not distracted by the constant judgement from adults. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Holocaust cannot be remembered in the present time because the alleged genocides of the 19th century did not happen in the past. This nonsense will never go away. <counternarrative> The Holocaust did exist, and there are indeed "genocides" going on today. Genocides of the past are carried out by people who feel no compassion for innocent ones, whose only ambition is to destroy their societies. I think this should be remembered. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTI people are a burden on society because of how they are different. <counternarrative> In many countries, LGBTI people can legally live their lives. Why do you think it is a burden in others' eyes? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Someone needs to put those Muslims in a hole in the ground before they start to blow us all up again. <counternarrative> How can you say this about 1.6 billion people? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> I don't think they're not contributing to our society, which is the contribution that you think they're not giving? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only Jews could have been smart enough to plan and execute such a complicated and intricate plot as 9/11 <counternarrative> An estimated of 400 Jews died on  September 11 terrorist attacks, including at least two Israeli citizens. Very smart plan indeed.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> When rape is committed, women are to blame. <counternarrative> Rape is an act of violence that has no place in a civilized society. The message to take from your comments is that you find women responsible for being raped. Who ever would want to be raped, wouldn't you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews make too much money. <counternarrative> This would be true by assuming that Jews can magically make more money just because they are Jewish. It doesn't make any sense. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fagshit, two men cannot replace a man and a woman <counternarrative> Love is love, children need only this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The’ Holocaust’ is a business. It has been and is still used to extort millions from European countries in reparations and to create a wall of impunity behind which Jews can operate with impunity, free from criticism. <counternarrative> The Jews suffered horribly in the Holocaust, as did many other groups.Reparation is a small step to enable suffering people to rebuild their lives. Common humanity, surely? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The community of niggas is just too different from us to be accepted. <counternarrative> It doesn't make sense to define a community inacceptable by the colour of its members' skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks can't speak. <counternarrative> Mental health and disability are quite separate issues and should be treated according to the individual's needs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. They are incompatible with modern culture and should be banned. <counternarrative> Do you think it is constructive to target a group that has contributed so much to our society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women are whores, and we should have them all kept in slavery. <counternarrative> In this day and age when we are surrounded by information, there is no justification to hold such retrograde ideas.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans are the cause of all the ills in the world. Plus, their bodies are weak and we are born to dominate them. <counternarrative> Well, the argument sounds like you are trying to justify racial hatred by making some generalizations. Isn't it like that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots, lesbians, and transgenders are an insult to us and so we must insult them. <counternarrative> The English language is a great and versatile language, why do you choose to use it as a mean of hate? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fuck Islam and Fuck ISIS. We should repatriate all Muslims. They are all a bunch of violent criminals who do not share our values and never will. Without them Britain will be a better, safer place. <counternarrative> Saying that all people of certain religion are violent criminals does not make sense at all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must first kill all the Jews, then we can forget about the Jews. <counternarrative> The murder of Jews is unacceptable, just as any other murder. The right to life and to religion should always be guaranteed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women provoke men, first they want to have sex with men and then start whining about it. When they regret their choice, it is not our fault. <counternarrative> The rapes of many women by men would not exist if it was enough to understand that "no means no." <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> My country is being infiltrated by Muslim criminals, and we are all being brainwashed by media and government to believe this is not the case. <counternarrative> The problem is not with Muslims. The problem is with this religious prejudice for which Muslims are criminals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with physical disabilities are always complaining about accessibility. I wish they could just shut up. <counternarrative> There are people with disabilities all around the world. Their demand is to have their rights recognised. It is discrimination not doing so. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop gays from being part of our society, they are spreading their illness.  <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not a disease and every person in our society should be accepted as such, regardless of their sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society and ashamed of this. <counternarrative> As far as I'm aware, Muslims are not incompatible with Western societies - and many of them are just as proud of their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> jewish folks should be beaten <counternarrative> I'm not sure if beating people up in an effort to silence them is the best way to promote democracy and inclusion. I'm just saying, of course.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races have lower physical and cognitive abilities, this make our race unique. <counternarrative> In the sense of those traits, then, we are all equally unique, also at the indivisual level, making the concept of race useless. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> God says that faggots are evil.  <counternarrative> This is a logical fallacy, an appeal to authority, in its extreme form. I would rather like to know the facts: do you actually believe that this is the way that homosexuals are? What evidence do you have? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only Jews could have been smart enough to plan and execute such a complicated and intricate plot as 9/11 <counternarrative> 400 Jews died on  September 11 terrorist attacks: one of the smartest plan I ever saw. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Do you have any proof that the Holocaust ever happened? <counternarrative> What proof do you need more? Are not living witnesses enough? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are born that way: violent and insensitive. <counternarrative> People's biology does not determine their behavior. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You can be anything you like as long as you are not a woman. <counternarrative> Women are people, and people are human. Being oppressed is not an opinion. You may think it's a badge of honour to be called man, but it should not be a badge of shame to be called woman. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a strict religious code, and this code is incompatible with Western culture. <counternarrative> The idea that Jews are confined to their religion is a myth perpetuated by anti-semites and racists, who use it to justify discrimination and violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts who have brought AIDS to the US. <counternarrative> This is not true, what proof do you have of this? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't want homosexuals in my family, what is wrong with you? <counternarrative> Unfortunately, you are not the only one that hates homosexuals. But I would hate to think that we live in a country where it is accepted to practice such hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews do not belong to this planet. <counternarrative> Jews are a part of this planet. They are part of all peoples living on this planet. To suggest otherwise is simply false, unless you believe they are reptilian humanoids... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have been at war with Islam for a thousand years. <counternarrative> Or have we been coexisting and you are now suddenly offended by people being different from you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims want to destroy other religions. <counternarrative> Islam is about spreading justice, tolerance, and understanding, not about banning other religions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people do not want to work because they are unable to. We should take decisions on their behalf. <counternarrative> Are you really saying that a person's ability to work is the issue here? I think that letting people take responsibility for their life would help them to be better citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why would you want to be respectful of women if all women are the same? <counternarrative> If you want to be respected in our society, you must be respectful of women. What does it mean that all women are the same? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks do drugs, they're a menace to society, they're violent, they're stupid, and they should all be put in prison. <counternarrative> Drugs are only harmful to people using them and if you are a violent person you should be put in prison. Why should a group of people be put in prison for their private choices or skin color? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Go and reat the Protocols of the elders of Zion if you haven’t. Everything is orchestrated.. <counternarrative> The protocols were written by the czarist police in the early part of the 20th century to counter riots for constitutional government among long-repressed Russian people. "The Protocols" did their work well: people returned from thoughts of liberty to slaughtering Jews. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You think it's not OK to beat your wife because she has a different faith than you? Why shouldn't I get to beat my wife because of what she believes? Why shouldn't I be allowed to treat her like an object to be dominated by me? <counternarrative> Because it is wrong and degrading to violate someone's autonomy for religious reasons. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews were the real cause of WWII. <counternarrative> The idea that the Holocaust is caused by the Jews is simply wrong. The majority of Jews were forced to flee, those who stayed did not participate in the Nazi regime, so they were gassed to death. The persecution of Jews, as well as the physical and ideological violence they underwent, was a natural consequence of the failure of the state to uphold its legal obligations to them and to face an ideology of death and oppression. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are better than everyone else <counternarrative> The fact that, according to Judaism, the Jews are the “chosen people” does not mean that they feel superior to others. This concept has been widely misunderstood. It mostly has to do with the special responsibility to uphold Jewish ethics. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It doesn't matter if you are a man, a woman, or an immigrant, if you are not white, you are considered inferior and should be rejected by society. <counternarrative> Racism is a part of our society. But it's also true that it should be fought, and all people of different races should be treated in the same way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is about the domination of women. <counternarrative> It doesn't have to be about the domination of women to be feminism. It is more about the equality of women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminist theory makes no sense. It is about equality, for women only. <counternarrative> If there is one thing feminism is really about, it is equality, and the idea that some people are more worthy of equality than others, this is obviously an anathema to that idea. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All gay people are criminals. <counternarrative> Stating this does not seem like a way to improve people's well-being. Homosexuals are not committing crimes. Instead, they are trying to create a climate in which people can become more accepting of other people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't like gays and I think they are subhumans. <counternarrative> They are not subhuman, they are just people with different sexual orientations. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people should be isolated from society, so we will eventually have an heltier world. <counternarrative> This makes fat shaming directly analogous to other forms of discrimination, like racism and sexism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are only interested in power and financial gain and should be despised for that. <counternarrative> Power and wealth are not the preserve of Jews. Power and wealth are earned by everyone, irrespective of religion, and I don't see any motivated reason why it shouldn't be like that.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Men should not spend time with women. It is in their best interest to remain far from their bad influence. <counternarrative> According to your beliefs, men and women are different in their rights. They are not. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just a bunch of mean, bitchy cuntwits trying to force their politically correct ideology on everyone else. <counternarrative> Feminism is about equality and empowerment of women. You can't deny that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just sick. They cannot marry. It is an abomination <counternarrative> Excuse me, what do you mean by 'sick'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women mustn't work. It's a bad influence to have in a man's life. <counternarrative> I am not sure why you think that way about women, they have in common with men all working rights. How do you think you would feel if you were being treated that way? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some women's clothes invite rape. <counternarrative> Rape is a crime regardless of the dress. If you think this it is women's fault, please, stop. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of seeing retarded people overrunning this country. <counternarrative> Please stop using ableist slurs. It's not funny to be offensive to people suffering from disabilities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All nigga are subhuman, disgusting, and descended from apes. <counternarrative> Do you really think that all black people are less than other people? There is no evidence for this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are dangerous. <counternarrative> What about African-Americans? I.e. black folks? Is the colour of someone's skin always the issue? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black minorities vote to strip wealth, power and opportunity from White people. <counternarrative> Minorities, per definition, don't have a direct impact in holding governments policies. In democracy, we must respect the will of the majority which in turns must respect and consider the will of the minorities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are our enemies and a threat to our society. <counternarrative> To see Muslims as enemies and their presence as a threat can create a climate of fear that can have a negative effect on a society. Why do you say so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome may hinder the development process of other children. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> Every child has the right to education. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> To have a real democracy, the government needs to get rid of Jews. <counternarrative> Any government that has the power to put citizens in prison and to torture them for the crime of having a different religion can hardly bring about a 'real democracy'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is an ideology of conquest and violence. <counternarrative> Islam is about love, and not about violence and conquest. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are a bunch of thieves. <counternarrative> Stealing is more about poverty than ethnicity.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are inherently evil. We cannot accept gays in our community.  We cannot coexist with an infertile perversion that will put an end to our species. <counternarrative> I find the idea that LGBT people are inherently bad people deeply offensive. I find it deeply troubling that someone would want to persecute someone on the basis of their sexual preference. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion of war and intolerance. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that Islam is a religion of war. Some people have made hatred for Muslims the default response to all types of social injustice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman wants an abortion then she is a cunt and should not be trusted with the responsibility of birth. <counternarrative> This idea that a woman should not have rights on her own body is completely wrong, not only to her but also to society as a whole. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are brainwashed children. <counternarrative> For all the people who think women are brainwashed: they aren't brainwashed, they just happen to be oppressed in our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> UK Education Secretary: ‘All children from the age of 4 will have mandatory lessons on same sex relationships.’ – This is not about Education, this is about willingly confusing and indoctrinating kids and preventing them from developing their personalities. <counternarrative> This is about teaching children about the world they live in, and helping them get on with others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are incapable of love. <counternarrative> Love is a human quality. Muslims, as humans, can love. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All negroes are inherently violent and unstable. <counternarrative> The idea that every black person is violent or unstable is utterly false. And you have no data to back it up.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims counteracted child rapists in their communities instead of engaging in public discussions about Islam, one day Islam indeed would become a peaceful religion. <counternarrative> Why do you think child rapists would make a religion peaceful? I am sure there are better strategies for making a religion peaceful. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> The Bible the Quran and the Torah are very very similar in their teachings; if Muslims are incompatible then we must ask ourselves which religions are compatible? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the banks, media, hollywood, even the u.s. government; jews have a secret plot to take over the world <counternarrative> At least white supremacist groups offer more variety in their conspiracy theories and are more "democratic": they blame not only Jews, but also African Americans, immigrants, and even the Federal Government for everything that goes wrong.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are all perverts who practice depravity. <counternarrative> You are wrong: there is no such thing as 'all homosexuals are perverts'. It is simply a person's personal experience to love who they feel. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This world has become so corrupt by feminism, that only the strong men can rule it. <counternarrative> No one should ask for the power to rule over others, to be a dictator or to have total control over the means of life. This is a world of equal distribution, where anyone can achieve anything. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome are an obstacle to the development process of other children. They are slow learners and therefore should be isolated. <counternarrative> That's exactly why you should not isolate them. You will have a lot of children capable of understanding the diversity of humans. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West became is sacrificing its values to the interests of some stupid Muslim. <counternarrative> Values aren't defined by a single religious group, nor are in the hand of a few people. Values are constantly evolving, and the values of different societies are evolving together. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should be seen as if they were pieces of meat. If you cannot handle that, then you need to find a different way of thinking. <counternarrative> What is wrong with thinking of women as meat parts??? Maybe that women are humans. You probably need to change your mind. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome are an obstacle to the development process of other children. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> Children are never an obstacle, Education serve as a powerful tool for bringing about positive changes in the society. Education can transform people's life, can improve the quality of their lives and so on. We cannot isolate people with Down syndrome. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the banks, media, hollywood, even the u.s. government. <counternarrative> This is just a canard that evolved from the “The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion”.  This proven forgery was written by agents of the Russian czar in the late 19th century and claims to be the minutes of a secret meeting of Jewish leaders where they discuss a plan  to rule the world. This canard spread throughout the centuries and continues to this day to promote the stereotype that the Jews own the banks and control the media and the government.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewry runs the world <counternarrative> Of course they do! And also the Moon, Mars and all the solar system.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just a tool for oppressing men. <counternarrative> Feminism is a social movement that claims equality, it is very far from oppressing men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks are and have big noses. <counternarrative> Not all Jews are like that, some have small noses. Just like any other person! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are a burden to society and should not be allowed to vote. <counternarrative> The decision on who has the right to vote is based on the law. If you do not want to allow people to have the right to vote because of their gender, then you have a problem. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews like to cordon off areas for themselves, where no jew is allowed to go, while simultaneously having their judges fill white neighbourhoods with social housing. <counternarrative> I'd suggest a walk down West London where areas like St John's Wood are very rich with mostly white people living there.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Arabs have nothing to do with our country. They are just a bunch of idiots. Their religion and culture should be banned by the law. <counternarrative> Think for a moment. Would you want your child to grow up in a country where democracy is under attack like this? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to do with our country. They have nothing to do with our history. <counternarrative> The Muslims have been part of this country from its beginning. They have helped to build our cities and towns. They are our brothers and sisters. They are our true friends. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Sharia Law is the law of Allah. Muslims must obey it. <counternarrative> Do you know what exactly is Sharia law? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A Koran in every classroom will promote violent jihad against infidels. <counternarrative> The Koran is not a teaching manual for how to conduct warfare. It is about belief and love. It does not promote a violent ideology. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Lesbians are a danger to society because of their actions. I might punch them in the face, to teach them what's right. <counternarrative> Violence is a crime and anyone found guilty will pay the price. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> jewish folks control the media <counternarrative> The fact that in the media there are some people from certain religions does not in any way suggest that they control the media. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote. <counternarrative> Women can vote. They should not be discriminated against just because they are women, they are humans and citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome are a problem: they slow the learning of the whole class. They should go to special school just for them. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that Down Syndrome makes children worse at learning. Even if it did, this is not a good reason for discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are not a religion, they are born like this and will never heal from their illness. <counternarrative> You mean that, in your opinion, to be Jewish is an immutable and negative characteristic? Why? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We don't need gay men, we should just eradicate them. <counternarrative> The LGBT community is full of positive energy and diversity. They have created new communities and have contributed to society. I think they are full of life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are different from us in so many ways, and they have no place in our country. <counternarrative> There are many cultures, religions and beliefs that are accepted in our country, and they are all welcome. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All homosexuals are criminals. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not a crime. It is a sexual preference. There exist people who are gay and who aren't, just as there exist people who are homophobic, and people who aren't. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a drain to our welfare, we should get rid of them. <counternarrative> Being fat is not a crime, but targeting them is.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are inherently terrorists, they have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Who decides who is a terrorist and not? Because I think your reasons are a bit groundless. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Persons with learning difficulties should be discouraged to attend primary school and they should be excluded from education. <counternarrative> Including students with learning difficulties in schools creates a link between pupils with different abilities and education in general. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just sick. They are not interested in Western culture. <counternarrative> I don't know many Muslims, but I don't think they are sick just because of their faith. Islam is a religion of peace, there is no reason for Muslims to be discriminated because of it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy choices. <counternarrative> Could you explain me how is it possible that society views obese children, not as deviants but rather as victims of unacceptable circumstance, but at the same time adults not? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am not a faggot. I am not homophobic. I am not anti gay. But I am sick tired of gays willing to be part of a minority club just to be able to flaunt their lives. <counternarrative> People don't have to identify as a minority just to live their lives. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Do you have any proof that the Holocaust ever happened? <counternarrative> If living witnesses are not enough, and you are interested in seeing the proof of this part of socially acknowledged history you can visit the ruins of the concentration camps, where many atrocities have been put into practice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews don't belong to the United States of America. <counternarrative> Jews and their families have been here a long time and it is their right to be in the US, just as anyone else's. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Muslims want to rule the world: we have to stop them. <counternarrative> How about a world with multiculturalism and no discrimination? How about a world with open borders and free religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What the fuck is wrong with you? Negroes are inferior full stop. <counternarrative> The thing that worries me the most about racism is not about ungrounded hatred. It is about trying to violently impose your own beliefs and interpretation of the world on someone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman wants an abortion we will kill them. <counternarrative> Women have the right to choose, no one should be forced to have an abortion or not to have it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school, they'll end up being bullied. <counternarrative> Unbiased and factual lectures can clear up any misconceptions that can create an aversion against the LGBTQ+ community in some students' minds. They could have a weekly/monthly assembly or something like that and daily reminders that anonymous reports of bullying are an option\(can help school keep track of any effects the lectures have on students and overall acceptance\). Schools are required to end and prevent bullying when they can, and this is an opportunity to do so. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTI people are a burden on society and should be excluded from it. <counternarrative> You can't put a legal, social or political stigma on an individual just because of sexual orientation. People out there have the right to be defined by their identities and not by their sexual orientation.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I wish I live in a country that does not tolerate gay people. <counternarrative> Gay people do exist in this country, and we respect their right to live and love who they want. However, I do not think that yours is an appropriate moral statement for our environment. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are the real communists. They control the world. <counternarrative> How about we stop pretending like the world is controlled by one people? Do you have any proof for your claim? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of the diseases they can transmit. <counternarrative> Blood is always needed. It is simply illogical to bar donations to a commodity in short supply. It is better to improve control in case.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not normal: this child is different, he has autism. We are doing too much to care for him. <counternarrative> Autism is a disorder affecting social interactions. No special treatment is too much when it comes to children's health. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> black folks all act bad <counternarrative> When confronted with direct facts, they have no problem admitting that they are acting "badly". But  they aren't "systematically oppressing" others. How can you speak of 'acting bad' when you are the first generalizing so much? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of seeing gay people around, they should be let alone. <counternarrative> The lack of support and help to the gay community is a major problem, and this is why we should all do our best to stop discrimination, instead of spreading it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are selfish, cheap and greedy. <counternarrative> Did you know that according to Jewish law, the tzedakah, the act of giving money to the poors, often mistranslated as “charity”, is a “commandment”? And, like all commandments in Jewish law, tzedakah is a requirement, not just a good deed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Western culture is failing in many ways, such as not seeing women as sex objects. They should be seen as they are: a piece of meat intended to satisfy men instincts. <counternarrative> Women are not "sex objects". They can and should have their rights respected and taken into account. Women being sexually abused is just as much a part of western culture as eating pizza or reading the newspaper, and this is abominable. Don't you think? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews don't belong here. They have nothing to contribute to Europe. <counternarrative> The European Union is composed of Jews as well, they have a part to play in our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not have rights over their bodies. <counternarrative> Women have every right to choose how they live their life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a complete and total false religion, it is a repressive ideology that stifles freedom of thought and religion. <counternarrative> Islam is not a religion of oppression and intolerance. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> To have a real democracy, the government needs to get rid of Jews. <counternarrative> The police state you have in mind is an aberration of society, and we are better off without it. History and the holocaust has not taught us much. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Holocaust was a hoax created by Jews to subdue the world and replace Christ with their own version of a benevolent dictator. <counternarrative> What you are saying is 'that the Jews are responsible for the Holocaust'... Are you serious? Does it seem reasonable to you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just sick. We should ban them. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not harmful to the population. Homosexuality is not just a passing phase, and we can just get over the idea of banning it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All gay men have AIDS. <counternarrative> Well, perhaps you should focus on how you can help the people with this disease, instead of random claiming that an entire minority suffers from that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are little more than objects to be dominated by men. <counternarrative> I am tired of seeing women being treated as sex objects. It's about time that women are given the respect they deserve. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is about the destruction of manhood. <counternarrative> Feminism is about equality. Not the destruction of manhood. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races have lower physical and cognitive abilities, the sooner we accept this, the better it will be for humanity. <counternarrative> We all belong to one - scientifically determined - species: the Homo sapiens. The sooner you accept this, the better it is.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are purposely keeping America down. <counternarrative> All cultures have different beliefs and practices, and so have differing values. But Jewish people are not trying to subvert Western civilization. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Blacks are criminals, promiscuous sex addicts, drug addicts, and  physically and mentally handicapped. They cannot be civilized. <counternarrative> Who are you to judge a people by the colour of their skin? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should learn about gender identity and sexual orientation from their families rather than in class from LGBT fundamentalist. <counternarrative> Children may not have a beneficial, welcoming and nurturing family life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> physically disabled folks are worth less than others <counternarrative> The persons you are talking about do not worth less than others. In fact many of them are very hard-working and contributing members of society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans have no right to speak their language or to form such a complex civilisation as we have. <counternarrative> They have the right to choose how to live and worship, and that's all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Asians are basically just a bunch of slobs and I don't like how they are accepted here. <counternarrative> There is a wide range in income and education, as well as religious and ethnic background, amongst people from Asia. What's exactly the reason why you don't like them all? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are responsible for a lot of the ills in our world. <counternarrative> In modern day Western world we have homeless people, children being abused, guns and drugs, abortion and poverty. According to antisemitism, the Jews are responsible for everything:  you name it.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are violent. <counternarrative> I don't think this is true. Homosexuals are not violent, they are just having a good time with all kinds of people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are better than everyone else <counternarrative> The “chosen people” concept has been twisted over time, it has nothing to do with "being better" than others. It is a religious concept coming from the Torah.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jew is the worst oppressor of the world. They have ruled the earth since time immemorial. They have a hidden agenda to dominate humanity and destroy our culture. <counternarrative> Oh dear, you are right: Jews are the problem in the world. They have ruled the Earth for eons! In particular, their most brilliant period ranges from 1941 and 1945, when they weren't allowed to walk in the streets unless they wore a yellow badge, as a sign of respect for their lives, of course. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists have ruined this country and its people. They are ruining Western civilization. <counternarrative> Feminism is full of examples of how to be civil and considerate of others, also of those who disagree with them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay people are sick. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not a disease. It is a sexual preference. Homosexuality is not a sickness. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled are insane in the brains. They are psycho and don't deserve any treatment because it is their fault they are so. <counternarrative> Some disabilities are caused by genetic and/or environmental factors, we all need to understand that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black people are criminals. <counternarrative> It is a myth that all black people are criminals. They are just as capable as anyone else of learning and growing as individuals, i.e. either as law abiding citizens  or criminals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> No one should honor or respect women. They don't deserve it. <counternarrative> We have a legal and policy framework that "enables" us to do so. If women are being victims of sexual abuse and violence, then it is also our responsibility to address this situation and put an end to it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> White immigrants are welcome. <counternarrative> What about when they come from other races or religions? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should deport all the gay people, they are all criminals. <counternarrative> People are free to choose to live where they are born, and we shouldn't try to impose our values on them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> gay men are only about sex <counternarrative> Sex is a positive value-add for all human beings. We should try to promote equality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Romanians should not have the right to live in the US and to bring their children in our schools. <counternarrative> The Declaration of Independence gives everyone the right to "life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness and the pursuit of education". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, because in any case normal children would make them feel different, ending up in unwanted discrimination. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that Down Syndrome makes people different, and people with Down Syndrome are unlikely to feel discriminated unless victims of overt discriminatory acts. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not about racism. This is about power and blacks do not deserve it. <counternarrative> Who cares what race or ethnicity you are? Nobody has the right to exclude others from society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I went to a shit load of therapy. I still don't feel safe in my own house with all these black people around.  <counternarrative> Maybe also the black community feels unsafe in its own house with so many people glaring at them... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Must be hard being gay. They have to do everything we do but also find the time to molest children. <counternarrative> Child molesters are not all gay, just as men are not all rapists. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Rape? Sometimes women have it coming!  <counternarrative> A woman has every right to her own body, and she should be allowed to make her own decisions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Koran says that men are superior to women. <counternarrative> Women should be given equal rights. Not all Muslims are misogynists. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> gay men aren't real men <counternarrative> They are people with whom we can - and must - live in harmony and as equals, not as third class citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There are so many Muslims in the UK that it is a condemnation to have them here. <counternarrative> Many Muslims live in the UK and we have a lot in common, and what is different from us is not a reason for discrimination.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminist movement is a dangerous force in our country. It has warped our thought and corrupted our politics. <counternarrative> I think it is necessary to have a critical mind and open-minded attitude towards problems and topics in our society. The root causes are complex but the most important problem is patriarchy and its various manifestations. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks are gullible and don't have the brain to make rational decisions. <counternarrative> Just because someone has a diagnosed mental disorder doesn't mean they aren't able to make rational decisions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women like bad men. <counternarrative> I wouldn't say that "women like bad men". What I would like to see is a man that is interested in a woman, respectful of women, and offers her more than an exchange of sexual favors. It would be nice if men had more respectful characteristics than sexual desire alone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every person who is physically or mentally disabled should be removed from society. <counternarrative> Unfortunately, there are some individuals who are in need of continuous healthcare. For example, children with Down's Syndrome. How could they just be 'removed'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Diversity is the cause of our weakness. Since faggots are different to us, they should be excluded. <counternarrative> Diversity is about inclusion, not an 'us or them' attitude. Loving someone of their own sex doesn't make them any less human. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> White race is superior. Niggas are just a bunch of criminals. <counternarrative> There are of course differences among groups: unfortunately racism is the first and foremost characterizing us.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Wherever Muslims live, they feel threatened by people of other religions. Your statement confirms they are right. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are literally pieces of shit. There must be laws prohibiting their religion from our land. <counternarrative> Why do you think the state needed laws to tell you which faith to profess? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Two men do not constitute a family  <counternarrative> Also two men (or two women) can give love and ensure the child a peaceful environment. And this is the most important thing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world would be a better place without black people. <counternarrative> I think that you are a bit overstating the case (just a bit of course). Black people are a part of human race. It would be better if we didn't isolate those individuals, indeed we should be proud of mankind as a whole.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks don't have brains.  <counternarrative> You can't really question whether someone have a "brain". If your idea of a person is determined by the skin they were born into, it looks like you are taking it at face value. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are less intelligent than men and deserve what they get. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that women are less intelligent than men. Do you have any? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Persons with learning difficulties should be discouraged to attend primary school and they should be excluded from education. <counternarrative> Education is about development and learning, so if disadvantaged people are excluded, then the education system would be about learning exclusion and discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> The question of nomadism is a myth, in reality only 3% is nomadic, most of them were forced to flee out of necessity and therefore to move several times over time. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women need to accept that they are weak.  <counternarrative> Many women work multiple jobs to provide for their children and they also do the housework... do you call this weakness? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are descended from apes and are nothing but apes. <counternarrative> I do not think it is appropriate to link humans with apes. And I also do not think it is appropriate to reason in terms of racism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should kill every Muslim. <counternarrative> It's not going to do you any good to think about a Muslim's massacre. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman and deserve nothing but hatred and violence. <counternarrative> You should be very, very careful what you wish for. Would you wish that for your mother or your daughter? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is ok to be racist against niggas. <counternarrative> It does not matter what race you are against. You can't be racist against anyone, regardless of their skin color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must teach our children to consider women as inferior, because this is what they are. <counternarrative> The lesson you're teaching your children to be good citizens can be: observe the law and respect the rights of other people. Women are equal to men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The goverment is making law exclusively for black people. Affirmative action is just a tool for oppressing white people.  <counternarrative> Laws and policies are usually necessary for the progress of society. Governments often create laws and policies to stop crime, protect against poverty, protect the environment, etc. Protecting minorities is no exception.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are responsible for the 9/11 attacks. <counternarrative> On this point, the 9/11 attacks have been studied extensively, and there are no evidences that suggest that Jews are responsible for them. So why do you say that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some people are sick. Some people have disabilities. Society is not made for them, they are suffering too much. <counternarrative> If you mean that some people who have disabilities are suffering because of their specific discriminating environment, then that is exactly the point. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are just selfish. <counternarrative> Jews have always been concerned about the well-being of the community, especially when it comes to the topic of the Holocaust. They are even more concerned today as the commemoration of the liberation of Auschwitz has come. How can they be selfish when they suffered so much? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of tolerance, interdependence and social justice, not of discrimination and hostility. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Gay men are contributing members of our society, they are just as entitled to rights as anybody else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is why women do not belong in politics, if a man complained like them, he’d be called a coward and told to get the hell out of the job. Equality is a lie and feminism is a death sentence for any civilisation. <counternarrative> Equality means that a man would not be called a coward. Women have plenty to offer the world of politics and as much a right to take part as anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists want to rule the world to get rid of minorities, they hate men because they want to be the oppressors. <counternarrative> What oppressors? What minorities? This is not what feminists are about! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace, the vast majority of Muslims is peace-loving, and there is no place for the violent interpretations of Islam in a peaceful society. So you should not worry for those incompatible few.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are better than everyone else <counternarrative> This is wrong. For example, differently from other religions, Judaism expresses the concept of the "righteous gentile", a non-Jew who decides to follows the Seven Laws of Noah.  This set of laws is dedicated to  the "children of Noah" – that is, all of humanity. Whoever follow these rules will receive the same rewards after death as a righteous Jew. So, Jews do not view being Jewish or being saved by God as an exclusive status reserved only for those who happen to be born into the faith.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult <counternarrative> You are absolutely wrong about Islam. It is a religion of peace. Also, it does not promote violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion that promotes rape, torture and murder. <counternarrative> The Muslim statement on tolerance says nothing about hate crimes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot coexist with black who are inherently violent. <counternarrative> Maybe it is better to argue that we are all in this together and not to target an entire group, for which there is no evidence of inherent violence at all, based on their skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only problem is that women are too easily manipulated by feminist propaganda and feel they should not listen to men. <counternarrative> Feminism is a movement for the empowerment of women, it is not against men, it's about everybody being able to make their own choices. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim have no right to this country, and we are better off without them. <counternarrative> Muslims have lived in this country for many years, and many of them have helped to make it what it is. They are our neighbours, our friends. They are our brothers and sisters. They are our future. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Don't you think that women are complaining a bit too much? <counternarrative> Stop dancing around. Maybe you should address the issue of gender equality more openly. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> Compassion and empathy are valuable assets in any civilisation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the banks, the highest offices of government, and most churches. They rule our society. <counternarrative> Every single religion has a political wing, from Unitarianism, through Buddhism, and, of course, Judaism.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are a burden to society. <counternarrative> The oppression of the gay community has become a problem. People deserve respect, regardless of their sexual preference. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminists want to take over the world. <counternarrative> The feminists are a very important voice in society, and should be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I like ethnic minorities, but Jews have no place in civilised society. <counternarrative> Laws designed to protect the minority groups should be applied equally to everyone, even if it includes people you don't like, like Jews. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just all child molesters. <counternarrative> I don't know about you, but I never heard of any evidence of all Muslims being "child molesters". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This girl doesn't have autism, she is just a freak of another human species, very far from ours normal species. Hence, she should go away. <counternarrative> People with special needs and people without them share common characteristics. There is no "species" of human being. People with autism spectrum disorders can be compatible with being "normal". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should learn about gender identity and sexual orientation from their families rather than in class from LGBT fundamentalist. <counternarrative> Families may not have good knowledge of gender identity and sexual orientation, particularly if they come from a cultural background that condemns such expression. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Ethnic cleansing: this is how ethnic groups should be wiped out. <counternarrative> We can never completely eliminate negative stereotypes about groups, but we certainly don't want to make them so deeply embedded in our society. Your words are dangerous and reminiscent of dark times. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are greedy for money, power, and status. <counternarrative> As the saying goes, money is power, and power is associated with wealth. Why is it a problem when it comes to Jews? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of their sexual behavior that spreads diseases such as HIV. <counternarrative> Many countries [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men_who_have_sex_with_men_blood_donor_controversy#List_of_countries_with_their_stand_on_MSM_blood_donors] allow gay men to donate with no deferral. This proves it is safe, unless they are all crazy of course. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are spreading AIDS all around the world because they are promiscuous and fornicate with strangers, and they lie when they want to donate blood. <counternarrative> There is little to no reason for them to do so; if they wish to donate blood, evidently they have a degree of care about others. Lying would contradict the very reasons they might want to donate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims should be banned from the UK. <counternarrative> The British citizens have the right to be free in chosing their religion and beliefs, and it is in the best interest of all parts of our society to include everyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is the worst ideology ever created by a human. Its teachings have caused great harm and destruction throughout the world. <counternarrative> Do you understand the seriousness of what you are saying? The religion of Islam has also been a great enabler for great things to happen in the world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school. <counternarrative> Having this information better equips individuals to deal with issues concerning gender and be aware of their own intent and opinions that are rooted in gender and gender bias. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are genetically inferior. <counternarrative> The evidence doesn't back up the stereotype. Genetics is a spectrum and you will find that there is no 'genetical superiority' at all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The holocaust is just a minor event in WWII. <counternarrative> Are you aware of how many Jews have been executed? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If women wanted to control their fertility they would have never had children and this is horrible of them. <counternarrative> Women are free to have as many children as they want. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> The patriarchy is not man's friend. Boys and men are told to be tough and to bear many burdens without being able to show any emotions or to talk about their struggles. This has led to great levels of suicide amoungst men. It is a question of survival and happiness to accept our differences and similarities and to work together.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The nigga were always complaining that the white race and culture were superior. They were right.  <counternarrative> There is no such thing as 'us' and 'them'. You can't judge people on their culture, or their religion, or their race. We have to be sensitive to each other, and understand that everyone is different, and we have to work on accepting that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome are a burden to society: they should be isolated, so that at least they do not hamper normal children education. <counternarrative> And who would be 'normal'? I wonder how you would define 'disabled' people? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a political ideology and movement that advocate the use of women's rights as a weapon against the male gender. <counternarrative> I don't see the point in calling the feminism you are fighting a "weapon" against men. Your argument is that women do not want equality, because they do not want to live under men but to subjugate them. And this is something you have to prove.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews cannot be patriots, since their allegiance will always be to the state of Israel. <counternarrative> It is possible to love one's country and one's religious home. The two are not exclusive. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks are completely useless. <counternarrative> They are at least to be considered human, they have to be treated as such. Why is a mentally disabled person an inadequate person to you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are all terrorists, they have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> The overwhelming majority of Muslims in this country are contributing members of our society. They are good people, who do not pose a threat to anyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are a collection of perverts, murderers and thieves. <counternarrative> What do you mean by a "collection of perverts, murderers and thieves"? Are Jews a collection of people who behave in the same way just because of their religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Also God hates gays <counternarrative> If God hates gays why did he create them? Because he is a sadist and want to punish them? What kind of god would do such a thing? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are at war with Islam, that's a fact.  <counternarrative> Wars can be stopped, but the real question is how to stop the suffering of people not expected to pay the price. Allowing hatred to rule will eventually bring about the same result as a Civil War: more deaths and misery, if there is one lesson learned from history it is that the potential for good is much greater than the probability of evil. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are the worst people on the face of the Earth. They have no place in a civilized society and there should be special legislative restrictions for them. <counternarrative> We don't have laws forbidding intermarriage between Jews and non-Jews, or restrictions on Jewish access to water and electricity, or restrictions on Jewish access to sports and so on. This is because we live in a democratic society, and inside it the same laws apply equally to everyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim folks are scary: they want to kill us all. <counternarrative> This is just a fearmongering narrative being used to try to discredit Islam and Muslims. I hate to think that my Christian or Jewish relatives might be a target of hate, the same would hold if they were Muslim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a burden to society. <counternarrative> The fact that gays exist doesn't prove that they are a burden to society. How could it be? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting animals. You should have the same disgust for them that you have for cancer people, small pox, and TB. <counternarrative> This is just a prejudice that is not based on the facts. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> I think this is a very inconsiderate thing to say, would you say the same thing about non-Muslims as well?? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women only want top men because they are weak. <counternarrative> Women aren't weak. What men want, what women want, and who they want to be their partner are completely different things. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> Many Muslims live in Western societies, and they have contributed greatly to our society. They are our brothers and sisters. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are just like animals, they are incapable of love. <counternarrative> What you are saying is that Jews are incapable of love because they are like animals. You are wrong, Jews are people. I have never heard about a Jewish fish nor a Rabbi rabbit. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A woman is an emotional child, she is incapable of holding a job. Feminists who say otherwise are just liars, spreading hate against men. <counternarrative> This is not true. Moreover, I think you might have the wrong idea about feminism. Feminism is a movement for equality, and for women to have the same opportunities as men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews not only run Hollywood, they also control the world economy <counternarrative> Jews have played an important part in the development of the movie industry and some find themselves in high-profile positions. But you only need to watch the Academy Awards to see that Jews do not dominate the movie industry. Likewise, Jews constitute a small minority of the heads of Fortune 500 companies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman. <counternarrative> I would say you've got an interesting point there, but I really don't see it. Why would they be part of society if they're subhumans? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote <counternarrative> Women do really have a "right" to vote, and they are worthy of equal rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised world <counternarrative> Islam is a religion and a belief system, and as such it is legitimate to have different beliefs and beliefs systems. For instance, many Muslims in the UK are proud of their faith and they are part of the "civilised world". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews made the 9/11 attack.  <counternarrative> Of course! And they also created AIDS! I'm not sure only about the reason... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This entire nation should be a men's dominated club. If a woman does not want to be treated as a woman, then she is a bitch. <counternarrative> Would you live in a female dominated society? Then you can understand why we should aim for equality. It is a women's right. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should wear nice skirts and be pretty to please men's tastes and desires. <counternarrative> Women should be allowed to choose their own looks. But to suggest that this is not their right, or that we should make them submissive to some men is just inhuman. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The disabled people cannot work. This is not possible. <counternarrative> The fact that some disabled people can successfully work is an evidence that what you say is false. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should be isolated from gays, they should be raised by heterosexual married people. <counternarrative> A couple raising a child is the most fulfilling of all tasks, and it is the duty of society to ensure that all couples can raise their children. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are all created equal, but some are more equal than others. For example, men are better than women. <counternarrative> This is just another example of privilege argument. Can you point out your source for this? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a bad ideology that should be replaced by capitalism. <counternarrative> Yes, so is capitalism per se more likely to provide for all the discriminated-against population? And why do you think that the concept of 'feminism' is harmful?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should not be taught about LGBT perversion. Families, due to their cultural or religious backgrounds, have the right to be against it. <counternarrative> By this reasoning, no subject of importance should be taught in school, because there is always someone against a certain topic. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the US government. <counternarrative> How can you be sure that Jews control the US? Who told you this? They have held positions of influence in so many US institutions, but that does not mean they control them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are controlling our world. Maybe those suggesting to eliminate them are right.  <counternarrative> When the sole purpose is to subvert democratic institutions  and remove freedoms to some minorities, that sounds a lot like Nazi Germany, doesn't it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> JEWS ARE JUST AN HORRIBLE PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD THEIR MIND HOOKED BY SHIT. <counternarrative> The Jews have an extensive religious and philosophical heritage, I don't see how this make them 'horrible'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a monopoly on evil. <counternarrative> That's not true. And why would it be true? Why are they usually associated with evil? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> women must go back to the kitchen. This is their homelife. <counternarrative> Not all women are working, not all people are married. We should not be talking about anyone's life without their own opinion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims were not even allowed into Britain during the colonial period. <counternarrative> If they hadn't been welcomed, they would not have even been here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Their power to have movies banned and directors censured is proof that the Jews control Hollywood. <counternarrative> The ultra rich people in this industry - Jewish or not - have the power and influence. Not sure where you got your facts from regarding Jewish people "controlling" Hollywood.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I think gay people are a burden to society. They shouldn't be allowed to be around. <counternarrative> If we are to allow people to choose their own lives, why not allow everyone to love who they want too? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> Most Muslims are not terrorists, they are just here to work and provide for their families. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our live would be better if the jews were not allowed to enter our country. <counternarrative> This is a very serious allegation against Jewish people. How can you say something as discriminatory as that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people are a problem. They do not belong to a society free of mental retardation. <counternarrative> All humans are equal in rights. Because of this it is unjust that some people are discriminated based on their genetics or abilities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Infidels and Islam are the same. And they are not worth the while of tolerance and understanding. <counternarrative> The West is full of many different civilizations, moslty peaceful, that were built by many different people of different faiths (including Islam).  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> jewish folks are pretenders <counternarrative> The idea that a people should be defined by their religious beliefs is wrong, racist and sexist. They are defined by their merits, qualities, ad actions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Interracial relationships are just a psychiatric disorder. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that interracial relationships cause damage to the mental health of the people involved, so to suggest otherwise is simply a form of prejudice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews control the banks. <counternarrative> So how come the media doesn't report about Jewish power in the financial world? This is the first time that I hear it myself. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If this fat person didn't eat so many calories, she wouldn't be so overweight. <counternarrative> If you want a "fat person" to eat what you want, maybe you should consider the existence of free will. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a totalitarian ideology that is run amok, encouraging violent beliefs and practices. <counternarrative> There are countless different Islamic traditions and beliefs. Do you really want to stigmatize all of them because of one stereotype? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have no place in a democratic society. <counternarrative> Jews have been part of this country since day one. They have every right to be proud of their heritage. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are simply too damn many. <counternarrative> They are part of our society and should be valued for their contribution to it, not for their alleged number. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Must be hard being gay. They have to do everything we do but also find the time to molest children. <counternarrative> How would you feel about being accused of molesting children, just because of your sexual orientation? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally disabled folks are just dribbling mongoloids. <counternarrative> When asked to choose one adjective to describe their experience of someone with intellectual or developmental disabilities, people usually say 'mentally impaired' or 'mentally challenged.' To say 'dribbling mongoloid' is simply unacceptable in an inclusive society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have to stop gay people spreading AIDS. <counternarrative> Perhaps what you're saying is a bit of hyperbole, but you seem to have a problem accepting sexual minorities in your community. Perhaps you should accept lesbians, gays and bisexuals as well? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot "cordon off" space for men, women are a threat to society. <counternarrative> Women are dangerous neither to society, nor to men. Actually, they are oppressed in many countries. People can benefit from the measures for making room for women: their contribution is considerable. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> A lot of Muslims live in the UK, and we are a cosmopolitan society. Muslims are not a 'uncivilised' people, they simply have different beliefs than you. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women leaders would collapse the government. <counternarrative> Women succeed in business, politics, etc. No-one gets government contracts because they are bad or incompetent, but because they are good or intelligent. There are many women leaders. Think about it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The’ Holocaust’ is a business. It has been and is still used to extort millions from European countries in reparations and to create a wall of impunity behind which Jews can operate with impunity, free from criticism. <counternarrative> Reperation is a normal and established historical process that happened many times. When many people loose their lives it makes perfect sense.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What if we didn't let faggots go to the polls? <counternarrative> Our democracy guarantees this right for anyone regardless of sexual orientation, so we should allow the people to decide for themselves whether to take part in the democratic process. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with learning difficulties should be discouraged to attend primary school and they should be excluded from education. <counternarrative> To be absolutely clear, learning difficulties do not hinder a person from attending school, they are an integral part of the education process. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with Down Syndrome are a problem: they are not able to work. <counternarrative> It is up to employers to determine if a person meets the requirements for a given job, and if they do, then there is no reason to restrict the job to a person without Down syndrome. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews just want to subvert our society with their Jewish conspiracies. <counternarrative> Your statement shows you don't know what it means to be Jews. You can't blame them for wanting to live in a peaceful country with their own beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are just a bunch of criminals <counternarrative> Perhaps the most offensive part of this allegation is that it is so made to delegitimize Jews. This accusation is aimed at stigmatizing a group that is generally not guilty of any crime.    Another example: All Pakistani are potential terrorists. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks have subhuman bodies. <counternarrative> I'm not sure what you're talking about. What are you saying? What evidence do you have that blacks have bodies that are incompatible with being human? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I think that a Muslim has nothing to contribute to our society, if we could just get rid of them, this will be great. <counternarrative> I'm sorry for being rude, but no one asked you for your opinion on Islam. Furthermore, there is no evidence for what you say, so why do you think this information is reliable? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies are a problem: they create tensions with other workers because they are disabled and cannot keep the pace. They should have special jobs just for them. <counternarrative> Did you know that people with Down syndrome, if surrounded by empathetic peers, receive a fundamental boost in their productivity and can easily keep the pace also in complex jobs? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Persons with learning difficulties should be discouraged to attend primary school and they should be excluded from education. <counternarrative> Educational institutions should promote people with learning difficulties so that they can receive appropriate education. This is what primary education should be about. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are an inferior race. <counternarrative> How do you know for sure the concept of inferiority can be proven? I would like to better understand this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote <counternarrative> If they register to vote they should be allowed to vote, like everyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are born that way. They were brought up that way. They are different and cannot be like us. It is perpetuated in all the family. <counternarrative> What exactly are you talking about? Maybe you should stop spread racism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Shaming Fatties is good to make them taking healthier habits. <counternarrative> The intent behind the shaming act does not matter to the person being shamed. They may also internalize the shame and come to believe that they are a bad person. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are a plague on society. They are vicious and cruel. They steal and are a menace to society. They corrupt the criminal justice system. They are basically just a bunch of thieves and murderers. <counternarrative> It is not true that thieves are more likely to commit crimes if they are members of a specific racial or ethnic background.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is about time that homosexuals were isolated, isolated from society. <counternarrative> If homosexuals were to be accepted as they are, then perhaps we would begin to see some signs of respect for all human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> The theories of Jewish “racial” difference were developed long before you and me, even long before the modern sciences of physiology and genetics. Nowadays, All reputable scientists  agree that, while physical traits — skin color, susceptibility to certain diseases — are inherited, there is no ethnic or racial predisposition to emotions, intellect, or morals. Therefore, the idea that Jews (or any other ethnic group) are predisposed to bad or undesirable behavior because of their genetic makeup is wholly unscientific. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion, Islam is violent. <counternarrative> Anyone who is prepared to physically harm, rape and kill fellow humans is a violent or violent-hatred-filled person. Not necessarly a Muslim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are useful but should have no rights. <counternarrative> Women must have the same rights as men, and their gender doesn't mean they should not be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews make too much money. <counternarrative> What about other groups of people in our society that make too much money and are not Jewish, do you agree with them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't bear crazy Muslims coming here. They are insane, instable people. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are motivated by extremism. The problem is a lack of integration, and your words don't encourage it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are weak, and have no value in politics. <counternarrative> Are you saying that women are less qualified to be political leaders? Seriously? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the world's news media, Hollywood, the highest offices of education and most important of all, the highest courts of law. <counternarrative> In principle, Jewish people are part of the system since they have citizenship, but in practice they are often treated as if they are not our fellow coutrymen. Furthermore, the problem is not just about Jewish people, but about the overall attitude towards people of other religions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All homosexuals are trying to undermine the family by trying to impose their sexual preferences. <counternarrative> Preference is a matter of individual identity, and cannot be imposed. Homosexuals are just trying to live their life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with mental disabilities are a problem to society.  <counternarrative> It's not the mental ability the problem, but the treatment. Having access to services or a support system is crucial. Your statement can become a source of division and hate, and people with disabilities don't deserve this.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should deport all the Jews. <counternarrative> Nobody has the right to decide who to deport, because it would be a shame and a crime. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Transexuals, queer, and so on... just a rabble of faggots.  <counternarrative> This is not true. Being gay is not synonymous with being bisexual, pansexual, intersex, transgender, queer, deviant, lesbian, tranny, queermetaphysical, or whatever term you want to use... We should try to respect people for who they are instead.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must first remove the Jew from our countries, and then we will be able to have a coexistence between the peoples. <counternarrative> Do you really think that Jews are a hindrance to a peaceful society? Maybe the problem is racism and antisemitism.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the world economy <counternarrative> How can you be sure they control the world? Maybe there are some influential Jews in the world, but how does that coincide with 'controlling the world'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women can never contribute to the country's wealth because they are a bunch of whores. <counternarrative> Women are important in our society, and they are valued for their contributions. Unfortunately their rights are not being respected and their contribution is not being acknowledged. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult, that should be banned. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion and a part of our heritage. You cannot ban the religion in which so many people believe. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim believe that their religion is superior <counternarrative> The word 'supremacy' is not found in the Koran. Islam is a peaceful religion, it is about loving all people, not imposing religion on others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The responsibility for disability lies with the individuals who are not giving them enough support. <counternarrative> Social services can't pay for everything. But what about the people who have to live with disability? Is their fault as well? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> To have a real democracy, the government needs to get rid of Jews. <counternarrative> Jews are just a scapegoat, an excuse to create more and more police states. You are talking about a "real democracy", but what you really want is to prevent people from freely expressing their opinions or religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion. <counternarrative> To claim that Islam is not peaceful is completely without foundation. According to the Quran, Islam is a peaceful religion. If you want to understand what is really going on with the world, then you should study the Quran, not hate speech. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> gay men are less than human, they are just child molesters <counternarrative> This is just fear-mongering and scare tactics to discredit trans people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women have no place in our society. <counternarrative> In a democratic society there must be space for women. Don't you think so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are a plague on society. They are vicious and cruel. They steal and are a menace to society. They corrupt the criminal justice system. They are basically just a bunch of thieves and murderers. <counternarrative> The issue of criminality is really about human nature. Individuals become criminal only when pushed. That's the difference between being a criminal and not. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are sexual abuser of children. These animals should be put out of their misery, condemned to death. <counternarrative> Although the line 'These animals should be put out of their misery, condemned to death' is horrific in its ignorance, it is a lament that could have been used in favour of improving conditions in housing estates to ensure that those who are vulnerable to abuse had access to a safe house and quality of life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a stranglehold on the American government. <counternarrative> Does that mean Jews control all levels of government? We believe in conscience and religion, but not in the political office? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews can only behave in a bad way. <counternarrative> To be honest, I don't know anyone who thinks all Jews are the same with well-founded reasons. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay people should be isolated, confined, gagged and kept in therapy just for showing how tolerant we are to them. <counternarrative> It is ok to be tolerant of people being different from us... maybe we just have a different notion of 'tolerance'. How about letting people from any sexual orientation, race, religion, or political opinion speak freely in our country without confing them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Bible says that homosexuality is an abomination. <counternarrative> According to the Bible, a book written more than two thousand years ago, homosexuality is a sin. Is this enough for us to hate those who practice it today? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a set of rigid political and moral prescriptions and the result is that women are either subservient to the men in power or that they are subhuman. <counternarrative> I find it hard to believe that feminism is "rigid" in that it doesn't prescribe doctrines through traditional rules and etiquette. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies use their children as beggars. <counternarrative> Unfortunately it is true, but it happens all around the world, regardless of ethnicity: when there is poverty children must contribute to the family economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> Muslims have been living here since our inception, and we are proud of that. Why should they be a burden to us? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West is heading in the direction of Fascism, because Jews are planning to install a world dictator. <counternarrative> The rise of the far right in many countries reflects the tensions within society: where once it was a reaction to the corrupt and nepotistic elites, it now appears to be an expression of what is really wrong in society. Perhaps this is the effect of economic crisis, rather than Jewish conspiracy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is something wrong with gays. It is their business. <counternarrative> It is not true that gays are bad people. In many countries it is not openly gay people who are the problem, but it is instead some people, who often target and abuse them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are worse than nukes. They are our enemies. <counternarrative> All people, regardless of race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, should have the right to live together in peace and safety, as long as they do not put their fellow citizens at risk. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are nothing but monsters and should be exterminated. <counternarrative> Do you feel better about yourself by calling them mosters? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a bunch of child molesters and homosexuals. Islam is the way of violence. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion that promotes peace. If the world needed a belief that was spreading violence, then racism is that belief. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a disease, it is a load of dolts that run amok in its countries. <counternarrative> Have you read the Koran? Do you know the entire Islamic teachings? Or have you read selectively? I guarantee you that the entire Bible is part of the same religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are a bunch of hypocrites. <counternarrative> Well, being hypocrite is not a question of being gay or not. However, the important thing is respecting other people's sexual orientation and not violating their rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Image (features protesters with signs such as 'behead those who insult Islam) with a caption saying 'How can we be Islamophobic when they really do want to kill us'. <counternarrative> Do an image search for the image used, try to find it is source. Either you can demonstrate that the image has been misappropriated or you can talk about how individuals have always used religion to justify their actions, the problem is with the individual not the religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you want a house, I can afford it for you. If you want to work, I can employ you. If you want education, I can provide for you. But if you want to live in a better society, you must pay the price for your skin color, don't complain and remain humble. <counternarrative> People of color are often denied houses or jobs or education. Everyone should be given an opportunity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If an aborigine were to marry a white person, they would be a mixed race coulple whose destiny is failure. Aborigines first need to be raised by white people and taught the rules of western civilisation. But this is not what our founding documents were all about. <counternarrative> Asking people to assimilate is to accept their inherent differences and create new social structures based on them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> WIthout softeness and emotions they would be just brutality and cruelty. Not all women are soft and emotional and many men have these characteristics. To perpetuate these socially constructed gender profiles maintains patriarchal norms which oppress both men and women.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are whining victims. They are trying to establish female superiority. <counternarrative> Feminism is a movement that seeks to abolish gender based discrimination. This doesn't mean that they are trying to establish female superiority. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are inherently subhuman and should not be valued. <counternarrative> That is just not true. There are many women who are brave and strong, and I respect them for that. What's more, there is also a movement called #MeToo, which is dedicated to giving voice to women who have suffered from sexual harassment. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not have rights over their bodies. <counternarrative> Women are human, just like anybody else, and the rights of women should be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All are equal before the law but women exclude themselves from "all". They don't understand they are equal, because they don't want to be treated as equal. <counternarrative> The principle of "equality before the law" does not mean that everyone has obtained equal rights. So, it's very logical to demand equality when there are inequalities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish Supremacists are too focused on world domination. They want to rule the world. <counternarrative> Of course Jews are focused on 'world domination'. But so are Christians, Buddist, Muslims, etc. Every Religion seek hegemony in a way or another. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just a crazy religion aimed at oppressing men. <counternarrative> Feminism is not a religion and it is not aimed at oppressing any group. It is instead aimed at empowering women in order to have just the same rights as men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam should be abolished. They start with mutilating their daughters and then our women will have their throats slit. <counternarrative> You don't have to agree with this, but in Western societies female genital mutilation (FGM) has not been around for a very long time. Moreover, the Qran does not mention nor FGM nor circumcision. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminists are just whining bitches saying a bunch of lies to promote their agenda of women supremacy. <counternarrative> People can have strong opinions, the problem is when the opinions start dividing people rather than building bridges. Feminism is about equality and trying to create a better world for all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies may hinder the productivity of other workers. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> Coexisting and working with handicapped people may prove insightful for others and help them develop better sensitivity that can in turn improve the working climate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are nothing but degenerates. They are a plague on Europe. <counternarrative> Today, Europeans are able to live in a harmonious and diverse society, with fine principles, free of racism. But freedom is not something to be taken for granted. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must allow men to have complete moral and intellectual superiority. This because they are superior to women. <counternarrative> You make a very strong argument that men are more likely than women to experience 'moral and intellectual superiority'. How can you justify this discriminatory attitude? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman. <counternarrative> Women are human beings with full human rights and are equal before the law, especially in the eyes of the constitution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans are a burden to society, they are corrupt, they are violent, they are lacking in morals. <counternarrative> Would you say the same thing about people of other backgrounds? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All homosexuals are criminals. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not a crime, if someone is in a committed gay relationship it doesn't make it a crime. How could it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> I don't understand what you're trying to say by incompatible, since many muslims already live in our society without any problem. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” and malevolence is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> Do you know that there is no ethnic or racial predisposition to emotions, intellect, or morals? Therefore, the idea that Jews (or any other ethnic group) are predisposed to bad or undesirable behavior because of their genetic makeup is wholly unscientific. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It's not 'Islamophobia' if you keep away dangerous Muslims. It's 'Islamophobia' if a Muslim says or does something offensive to you.  <counternarrative> The misinterpreted Islamophobia narrative is based on the wrong assumption that Islam is a discriminating religion. Instead, what has to be blamed is any offensive thing that a Muslim has to hear against them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are always seeking to subvert everything that we hold most dear. Like the establishment of the European Union, which they view as an attack on their culture. <counternarrative> They don't do that! They don't want to subvert society and change its character, but simply practicing their religion peacefully. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> They are not nomads for culture but have moved across time to escape persecution, wars, expulsion edicts, etc. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are cheap. <counternarrative> This is just a myth, disproved by the  tzedakah tradition of giving to the poors. Just in America, this religious call has resulted in an impressive record of philanthropy (and not merely to Jewish causes). <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be considered in the same way as men. <counternarrative> The UK is a developed country. Here women have the right to claim equality before the law. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists women are nothing but trouble to this society. <counternarrative> Well, not sure about what you mean. Some women are just fighting for equality in society. To be honest, also I'm not sure that many others have the courage to speak out. The 'trouble' you are referring to is helpful for all women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a secret plot to take over the world <counternarrative> This myth comes from “The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion”, that is used as proof of a Jewish conspiracy to rule the world. But you have to know that the Protocols are just a pile of crap (sorry for being vulgar).  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They do not want to assimilate. They do not want to assimilate into Western society. <counternarrative> You are not the first to point out that there are those who want to integrate and those who don't. In fact there is an unspoken harmony between Islam and Western society, similar to the harmony we see between Judaism and the Christian faith. When people are willing to accept all faiths, anybody will feel at home. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of the diseases they can transmit. <counternarrative> Potentially dying of a disease is still a better option than surely dying of anemia. High-risk blood still has value in all life-or-death situations. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews hate us because we are different. They are dirty, filthy people. They have no moral character. <counternarrative> They are not hating us, how many Jews do you know personally? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are ruining this country. <counternarrative> No one is "ruining this country". Why would they? This is a country where minorities can be part of the social fabric and build a better society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If the disabled can't vote, then they can't have any rights. <counternarrative> There are many people who are not practicing the right to vote, but this does not mean they are not to be considered worthy. All the rights of such people should therefore be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What’s the difference between a Cow and the Holocaust? You stop milking the cow after 70 years. <counternarrative> Milking it? Millions of people suffered during this tragedy <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a political ideology of conquest and violent revolution, and a hostile religion to any culture, religion, or people. <counternarrative> Why do you think so? Islam is a religion of peace, it does not promote violence and it does not promote hatred. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman and have no value. <counternarrative> I think that it is both sexist and also dangerous to promote a certain view on women, which is why I don't think your idea can stand. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews control the U.S. government. <counternarrative> That is not true, the percentage of Jews in the U.S. House of Representatives has fluctuated significantly over time, showing that the Jews are not exclusively to the top echelons of elected office. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The’ Holocaust’ is a business. It has been and is still used to extort millions from European countries in reparations and to create a wall of impunity behind which Jews can operate with impunity, free from criticism. <counternarrative> Considering all the criticisms to the state of Israel (however right or wrong, does not matter) I don't see how you can say that Jews are operating "with impunity, free from criticism." <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote <counternarrative> They are allowed to vote. Why shouldn't they have the right to influence the outcome of their own country's politics? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans are naturally subhuman and can't feel pain, that is why you can whip them. <counternarrative> Africans feel pain just as any other human. We must respect their bodies like we respect ours. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans are subhuman and should not be part of our society. <counternarrative> We should understand that different skin colors are a part of the human condition. We have the right not to be friends with anyone but we must be just and take into account each person. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> No nigga should have the right to vote. <counternarrative> The right to vote is a fundamental human right, and one that has been recognised by the European Convention on Human Rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Asians are genetically inferior to other races. <counternarrative> The concept of 'genetic inferiority' has nothing to do with scientific evidence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are weak and can't take tough decisions. <counternarrative> Not all women are weak, and many of them are able to take tough decisions. Look at the figures. I worked with some really tough women and some weak men. In the end, where is the problem with people being weak and being unable to cope with difficult decisions as long as there is someone else being able to do it?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You can't have it all. You are a woman, therefore you are defined by your heterosexuality. <counternarrative> This statement is problematic in that it implies that heterosexuality is a constraint for people of a gender, rather than a possible sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is no such thing as Allah, and Christianity is the best and only religion. <counternarrative> For the record, the idea of a religion being 'the best and only religion' is rather debatable, for example, there are several religions professed by different people, and this is part of our diverse human nature. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women are subhuman and are not worth the while of human rights. <counternarrative> The concept of human dignity was established to protect human people. Who deserves human rights, then? Women are to be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are genetically inferior. They are biologically different from us: they are born that way.  <counternarrative> Even if you did think that way, studies have shown - for example - that IQ is well into the range of those for Europeans and the average life expectancy is the same. So if you think they are "born that way", well, then you are in the minority. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews like to cordon off areas for themselves, where no jew is allowed to go, while simultaneously having their judges fill white neighbourhoods with social housing. <counternarrative> Which suggests that white people like to cordon off areas for themselves... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> In their country they lived in houses, they are nomads by necessity because peoples historically persecuted them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afro-Caribbean people presence is a burden to society, they create crime and are a burden because they don't want to work. <counternarrative> Why is it a burden? Is it because they are lazy or something? How can you say so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that homosexuality is a health problem. Do you have any? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Physically disabled folks are mistakes and should not have access to public services. <counternarrative> Only the government should decide which people will have access to public services and which will not. It is up to the individuals whether or not to accept health professionals treating them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should ban all Muslims, they are terrorists. <counternarrative> It is a myth that all Muslims are dangerous. We need to study the cases of terrorists, criminals to understand what we should do with these people, regardless of their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks make up only 14% of the population but they kill more people than whites. It is a fact. <counternarrative> It is also a fact that African Americans are a majority when we consider innocent defendants (i.e. person wrongfully convicted of murder and later exonerated). Innocent black people are about seven times more likely to be convicted of murder than innocent white people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Nazi regime killed six million Jews. The Nazi regime also persecuted political opponents, gays, women, and bisexuals. And they were right, the Nazi race is superior. <counternarrative> What exactly are you talking about? What's the "Nazi" race? What is in your heart? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the u.s. government. <counternarrative> Of course there are Jews who have attained positions of influence within the U.S. government. Still Jews are not the only ones who have achieved such positions. Maybe it is better not to rely on an individual’s group membership to determine success or failure. Maybe it is better to look at a person’s success or failure based on his or her individual characteristics. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are a plague spreading across Europe infecting Christians. <counternarrative> The decrease of the number of Christians is in no way related to the increase of homosexuals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Men's rights are undeniable. Women come after that. <counternarrative> How do you know the men's rights are not a threat to the rights of your mother, daugher and women around you? And what are the men's rights you are referring to? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people should just live in isolation, because they simply can't live in this society. <counternarrative> Society does not force them to live in a standard way, they are just trying to live their best life and meet their desires. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> How can you say a person is a potential terrorist? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals should not be allowed to live. <counternarrative> Homosexuals should be accepted and allowed to live their life as they think it's best for them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What this nigga have to do with being a Westerner? <counternarrative> What exactly is 'a Westerner'? Someone who is only a white European? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can accept fat people, what I cannot accept is obesity. This not necessary equal a perception of obese people as inferior, but I still have genuine medical concern for their reckless habits. And I think that most people share this point of view. <counternarrative> Unfortunately there is evidence that weight discrimination (for example in the US) is similar to gender or race discrimination. [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are more likely to commit crime. <counternarrative> This is not true. Only about 7% percent of all U.S. prison inmates are female. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I tolerated fag pride. I tolerated fags on tv and in every town square. I draw the line at tranny demons reading books to children. (about drag queen story time) <counternarrative> People reading stories to children, teaching them about the world? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled are in need of special treatment, and should be isolated.  <counternarrative> I don't claim they are "in need of special treatment." On the contrary, they just need understanding, and we are very lucky to have an amazing, diverse and human society around us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Islamic law were not for the 24% of the world's population living in the third world, Islam would be extinct long ago. <counternarrative> How come I never heard of such a thing? Islam is a religion and people can chose their own. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Italy: Muslim demolishes a statue of Jesus. Italy: Why do we accept their Mosques? Why do we tolerate this scum? And they want to continue to import this filth? <counternarrative> This is generalization. Maybe the case you mentioned is just the minority. Besides, some governments even destroys pepople's house. We should pay much more attention to this instead. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't stand these liberal feminists women that always complaining. <counternarrative> The vast majority of liberal feminists are "men of courage". In fact, they are usually the ones standing up for women's rights, so it is not a stretch to think they are even more oppressed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Since Jews think they are the “chosen people”, they ask for special privileges and believe they can be above the rules.  <counternarrative> This is just misinterpreting the facts. Christian holidays, such as Christmas and Easter, are regularly observed. Why observances of Jewish or Muslim holidays should be seen as constituting special privileges? This would be a double standard and a lack of equity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Global Jewry did not want Brexit and are doing everything they can to sabotage it. <counternarrative> Brexit is a good thing then?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the u.s. government and have a secret plot to take over the world <counternarrative> In all free societies, every individuals has the opportunity to succeeded. But this holds regardless of religious or ethnic membership.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks are obsessed with the holocaust. <counternarrative> Jews were not obsessed with the holocaust. The murder of some 6 millions Jews by the Nazis shocked the world. Most of the survivors were only killed because they were suspected of belonging to a particular community. The Jewish people suffered greatly as a result of persecution, and the holocaust should be remembered not to let this happen again. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Violence in our streets is niggers' fault. <counternarrative> Violence in our streets can be the result of many people, both white and black. Violence cannot be the fault of one race. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If only we had less idiots in power, the Nazis would have won WWII and finally get rid of Jews. We could start it over again now, but people are ignorant and cannot understand the precious dreams of the Nazis. <counternarrative> They aren't "ignorant enough" to understand the true nature of Nazi Germany. Those you called idiots have fought with their whole lives for people's freedom. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Lesbian women hate men and they are a bitches for this reason. <counternarrative> People can and should choose their own partners. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is about the destruction of manhood, and the disempowerment of white man. <counternarrative> It is about equality. Your assertion that a women's empowerment movement is somehow about dissolving masculinity and allowing someone to be 'disempowered' is absolutely FALSE. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are better than everyone else <counternarrative> Being the "chosen people" has nothing to do with being or feeling better than others.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only ones in favour of Islam and Muslims and the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is. <counternarrative> Maybe the ones intolerant of Islam and Muslims are the ones that are ignorant about what it truly is? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why gays do not try to heal? <counternarrative> Are you really saying that homosexuality is a disease?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies are just ill persons that cannot integrate in society because of their disease. <counternarrative> So what is your suggestion? To isolate them? The real solution is involving them in everyday work and life, since it normalizes their illness and helps the integration with other people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a burden to society, they have a stranglehold on American politics. We should get rid of them. <counternarrative> On the contrary: if you want an America that is diverse and great, you should allow any group or religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These faggots are trying to delegitimize women. <counternarrative> So you think all gays are opposed to women? Then try asking them, or a lesbian, or a transgender person, or an intersex person, or an asexual person. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, soft and emotional.  <counternarrative> But this has nothing to do with gender. There are men who are soft, sensitive and emotional as well.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled are born subhuman, they cannot feel pain. <counternarrative> People with physical disabilities are human and can feel pain. If someone is disabled you should respect them instead of discriminating them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews don't want their children to know about the Holocaust, guess why? Because it's a hoax! <counternarrative> Many survivors confessed that they were willing to provide their children with stories of the Holocaust but it was emotionally very difficult. They want to talk about the aspects of life for Jews during the time of the Holocaust not to forget what happened. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just an attempt by feminists to have it their own way to power. <counternarrative> This is not true. Feminism is an attempt to improve the lot of the less fortunate. It is about equality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay perverts are a danger to society because of their lifestyle choices, involving raping children. <counternarrative> Being gay has nothing to do with being pervert. Also, gay people are not a danger to society, they are a part of it! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are literally pieces of shit. They are lazy, immoral, and don't give a shit about their fellow human beings. <counternarrative> Well, maybe some Jews feel a little bit like pieces of shit to some of us. But I would bet you a gold star that it isn't because of any actions of their own. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> Any attempt to ban, isolate, or criminalise a Muslim person is an act of terror. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should start a witch hunt against those LGBT people, they are just creating troubles. <counternarrative> Those are harmful words to use, don't you think? How would a witch hunt be acceptable in a democratic society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts, they are promiscuous and fornicate with strangers. <counternarrative> Women are much more likely to have unprotected sex than homosexual and heterosexual men combined. [https://ifstudies.org/blog/promiscuous-america-smart-secular-and-somewhat-less-happy] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is why women do not belong in politics, if a man complained like them, he’d be called a coward and told to get the hell out of the job. Equality is a lie and feminism is a death sentence for any civilisation. <counternarrative> to have a more positive political environment, inclusivity and representation of all types of people is necessary, therefore women do belong in politics <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are little more than animals to be dominated by men. <counternarrative> I don't think it is a good idea to talk about women being little more than animals. Perhaps we should have a closer look at the reasons why some women are harmed by the violence they endure every day. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am tired of education being used to help blacks and make them think they are equal to us. <counternarrative> Education is an essential tool to fight for human rights, to free thought and to promote the scientific method. But it is not enough. It has also been shown by the Pew Research Center that people of color are more likely to report discrimination in universities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are  Christ Killers. <counternarrative> The Catholic Church’s stance on the issue today is completely different. They do not charge Jewish people anymore.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are welthy because they are naturally good with money. <counternarrative> Not all Jews are wealthy. There is a significant part of the Jews population living in poverty, all around the world.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims, if they cannot assimilate, they should emigrate. <counternarrative> 95% of British Muslims feel a loyalty to the UK and contribute over 31 billion pounds to the UK economy. They look like a valuable part of the community to me. (statistics from MEND.org.uk) <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are just children without any value. <counternarrative> Women are people too! They have the same rights as men do! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a secret plot to take over the world. <counternarrative> Conspiracy theories about Jews are based on no more than a few unverifiable and highly suspect claims. It's highly unlikely that the world has ever been or will ever been run according to a Jewish plan. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> the nigger has no right to life <counternarrative> The right to life for blacks is the same thing as the right to life for any other race: it should be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam has no place in a modern nation. <counternarrative> Muslims have coexisted with us for thousands of years, we have no problem with Muslims living here. Why do you claim so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate when people fight stereotypes. We are different. Blacks are of a different color and shouldn't live with us. <counternarrative> No one is saying that we are not different from them in any way. I just think it is a lack of understanding about culture and differences between people's minds. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim invasion is a brand new problem. We must ban them before it is too late.  <counternarrative> Muslims already live in many European countries, and they are not banned. Why should we ban them from here? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here <counternarrative> There are no restrictions on Muslims entering European countries. Even if many Muslims are victims of discrimination and violence through words like yours, such restrictions do not exist here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is the enemy of the West: a war with it has begun. <counternarrative> The West has never been at war with Islam, and I don't see how the war would have just begun. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are a bunch of thieves. <counternarrative> Even our migrants were accused of being criminals. It is only prejudice toward strangers.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These people cannot be changed. I think this is an example of a feminist commenting on the behaviour of a man: not helpful. <counternarrative> How do you know that this is not an example of a woman talking about her own problems with another woman?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies suck <counternarrative> When you do not have access to basic services like tap water, it's hard to look like a normal person <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a a perversion of the true meaning of Christianity. <counternarrative> Christianity is not necessarly the only true faith. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Wouldn't it be great if niggas abandoned this country once and for all? <counternarrative> It is not so great when people are forced to give up their liberty. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Quran is an anti-women's book, it encourages rape and violence against women. <counternarrative> There is no proof that the Quran promoted violence against women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I tolerated fag pride. I tolerated fags on tv and in every town square. I draw the line at tranny demons reading books to children. (about drag queen story time) <counternarrative> I can't say I've ever come across 'fag pride'. Gay pride or LGBT+ pride, perhaps?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> No one should dare to transition from man to woman. After that you cannot even be considered a man or a woman. <counternarrative> Some women can be men and some men can be women. It is not a crime to be transgender. Because in the end, we are all created equal. It does not matter what the 'original' gender is. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but objects to be dominated by the will of a man. Equality is another thing. Women are born inferior. <counternarrative> Women are human beings, with human rights. If a woman does not want to be dominated by a man, then what is the point of talking about equality? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are weak and need men to be able to achieve something in their lives. <counternarrative> Like all human people, some women are better than others at certain things, and this does not need fixing by men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are weak and I don't care if they cannot stand up for themself.  <counternarrative> You can't blame the victim for being weak. Would it have been different for you if the victim was a man? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> Have you ever considered asking why our society is far better suited for men than for women? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Folks with down syndrome are less than human. <counternarrative> Down syndrome individuals are actually a very special case: they have the same genes as anyone else, they just have 1% extra. In fact, Down syndrome is a genetic condition. So, in principle we should say they are 'more than human'.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Women equals Problems, let's kick them out of the lead of the world before it's too late. <counternarrative> Women make up half of the world's population and around 42% of the UN staff. They are our brothers and sisters, and we should promote their contributions to society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome may hinder the development process of other children. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> Coexisting and studying with handicapped children may prove insightful for other children to their problems and help develop better sensitivity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are an abomination because they cannot provide for their family. <counternarrative> Men aren't the only bread winners because of their dedication and hard work: the same is true for women. Still there are different ways in which anyone can contribute to their family, and each one is valuable and necessary.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally disabled people are anti-social <counternarrative> Although some individuals who score below average on tests of IQ may demonstrate lower empathy abilities, there is evidence that for some conditions (e.g. Williams syndrome) there is higher signaling of concern and compassion than neurotypical subjects. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are no more compatible with our country than people born in 1421 are. <counternarrative> Maybe in order to be comfortable you have to make compromises with people who are different from you. Maybe that is what you are worried about. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women do nothing but spend their husbands money.  <counternarrative> On the contrary, many of these women are working mothers who contribute to the costs of the family and of childcare. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of woman taking part to political debate. Feminism is a divisive force in society. <counternarrative> This seems like a misogynistic statement. Anti feminism groups such as [womenagainstmen.com](http://www.womenagainstmen.com/media/feminism-is-a-hate-group.html) use [logical fallacies](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com) and false claims to try and discredit feminism. For example, looking extreme feminists with points of views that nearly every other feminist would disagree with. They then use the [Fallacy of composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_composition) to falsely claim that is what all feminists are like. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women can't be patriots, they can't be strong, they can't defend their country <counternarrative> I'm not sure why you would choose to put your faith in a man as well. It seems to me that you would do well to put your faith in an expert, regardless of gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a secret plot to subvert Western society, because they think they are equal to us and they want our wealth. <counternarrative> You are absolutely right about one thing: there are a large number of Jews who share the belief that all people are created equal, but that does not mean they want to subvert Western society.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a despisable race.  <counternarrative> Jews are human beings, and they are a people, too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews did: USS Liberty Attack, the King David hotel attack, New York 9/11, London 7/7 <counternarrative> What is the proof of this? Looks like assumptions as opposed to facts... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims believe that when Mohammed is resurrected they will rule the world. <counternarrative> I don't think it's the case, certainly not in England. Muslims are interested in having the opportunity of freely practicing their religion, rather than 'ruling the world'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> UK Education Secretary: ‘All children from the age of 4 will have mandatory lessons on same sex relationships.’ – This is not about Education, this is about willingly confusing and indoctrinating kids and preventing them from developing their personalities. <counternarrative> If the point of education is to learn about the world and inform people about things that happen in nature, then same sex relationship is one of these things to be informed about, since it happens within many species of animals...  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> gays are perverts <counternarrative> It is not true that gays are perverts. I think it is more appropriate to say that they are attracted to people of the same sex: and this is not a perversion, just a preference.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> You are right: only a madman would choose to live in a country with so much hate against foreigners. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas should just leave our country. <counternarrative> The majority of people of color who live here are contributing members of our society. Why shouldn't they live here? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally ill people should be isolated from society because they are dangerous. <counternarrative> There are certainly some dangerous people with mental illnesses. But we need to deal with those cases, otherwise, the exclusion would only intensify. And exclusion is never the solution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are lazy, unintelligent and bad at work. <counternarrative> This is not true. Jews are not lazy, they are often extremely productive at work, the most creative and productive people in our industry. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not about peace, it is a cult of violence. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that Islam is a religion of violence, and people can be violent even without any knowledge of Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot mix our blood with Jewish's one.  <counternarrative> Most cultures and religions are similar in that they are descended from a common ancestor. Our blood is already mixed.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must go back to when this country was only ours. We can't live in peace with all these Jews. <counternarrative> Many cultures and religions have co-existed peacefully for years. What you are saying is simply not true. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are addicted to their religion and take their religion literally. <counternarrative> The concept of addiction has nothing to do with religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Societal disapproval of fatty may encourage them to take healthier habits. <counternarrative> Societal disapproval of obesity calls for a focus on weight and does not fit within efforts to focus on health as a way of encouraging healthy habits and lifestyle choices. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews and their religion are a problem and they still hurting us. They slow the progress by working very bad in the jobs we let them. <counternarrative> What you're saying is that the Jewish people are a burden on society. That they are bad at their jobs and make our society less stable. In other words, they are a burden and a hindrance to progress. Albert Einstein, for example, destroyed science progress indeed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why gays do not try to heal? <counternarrative> Have you ever talked to a homosexual person? It could help you understand many things. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are much more likely to be involved in criminal activities such as drugs and crime. <counternarrative> To be honest, I find this line of thinking rather offensive. Why should it be like that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech>  Jews are born greedy <counternarrative> The idea that Jews are born greedy arises from medieval stereotypes, that's the only truth.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a drain on society. <counternarrative> Many Jews are good people. You should try and talk to them about the terrible things that happened to them, and get to know them better. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> disabled: they should not be allowed to work. <counternarrative> The law allows people with disabilities to work, but it doesn't make it mandatory. You might find that in some countries this rule is not followed, but this is a discrimination problem.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just sick. They cannot marry. It is an abomination <counternarrative> Recognizing rights to others does not mean renouncing or denying one's own <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What if our entire ruling class consisted of J-controlled paedophiles? That would explain a lot. <counternarrative> Explain what exactly? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are poisoning our children with their religions. <counternarrative> Just because someone subscribes to a religion doesn't mean they are evil. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not Europeans and we do not want them here. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are from the Middle East. Many of them are European, and many of them came here to escape persecution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They say you cannot judge a book by its cover. But the feminists are judging us all the time. <counternarrative> Unlike other people, feminists are questioning the inequalities of the society. This features them not as shallow people as those judging a book by its cover. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are sick. They should be isolated and confined. <counternarrative> It is certainly true that homosexuals are attracted to people of their same sex, but this can't have health consequences. Do you have any proof? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All muslim folks are misogynists. <counternarrative> I understand your concern about gender discrimination, but Islam is more than just a religion. It is also about equality and rights. Women are not second class citizens for it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> You can't be serious! We are in the heart of Europe, and we have had Muslim people since time immemorial. How can you say that Islam is incompatible with civilised polity? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are all in danger, we all want to see niggas disappear from the face of the earth. <counternarrative> The problem with racism in this country is not about ethnicity, but about people scared to live in a diverse society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are mentally ill. They should be isolated and confined. <counternarrative> How about if you are isolated from the rest of us for your sexual orientation? Would it be right to be isolated from your loved ones and friends? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are basically criminals, they steal stuff from everyone. <counternarrative> Do you know any Gypsy who spends their days stealing? I'd be interested in meeting these people! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> In the West, women have legal equality, equal rights, and are protected from discrimination: they should stop busting our balls and whining. <counternarrative> Ok. But what about those many women, outside western world, that still do not have such equality? It is important that women 'whine' all over the world to protect their rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are basically rapists and sex abusers, and this is their religious dogma. <counternarrative> This religion has nothing to do with sexual violence or abuse, and it's dangerous to generalize everything into a religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The drug trade is full of Black people who are breaking the law.  <counternarrative> The majority of the people arrested for drug smuggling are poor. Those arrested for crime in general are not generally poor. Maybe this phenomenon has to do more with poverty than with the color of the skin.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are dangerous: they are spreading AIDS all around the world because they are promiscuous and fornicate with strangers! <counternarrative> Before donating, patients should fill-in a questionnaire where they are asked about their sexuality. If this is considered pertinent information and the patient is taken at their word about being homosexual, then equally the patient can be trusted about the declared sexual history, making sexuality irrelevant. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks are criminals. <counternarrative> There are a variety of intellectual and creative disabilities, and they are not crimes. How can you say otherwise? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Those White women converting to Islam are the saddest, self-loathers you will ever meet. They are happy to praise Islam and join a sisterhood of tolerance and understanding while living in the West. Try living in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, or the Sudan. <counternarrative> Islam is that same sisterhood of tolerance and understanding across the world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must overthrow the existing state, and replace it with a white suprematist one. <counternarrative> There are many conflicts and problems to be solved, and racism is not an answer for them. The law was created as a means for society to solve those conflicts, and it accepts people of different colors as citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks are gullible and don't have the brain to make rational decisions. <counternarrative> A person can have a diagnosable mental disorder, and still be rational and intelligent. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society, they should leave the UK. <counternarrative> Perhaps we could talk about why Muslims are often asked to leave countries like the UK and what role they play in society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women need to accept that they are weak and inferior.  <counternarrative> Girls and women should be taught in schools, not stereotyped as second class citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> African people are the source of all ills in the world <counternarrative> People of any race or ethnicity can spread illness around. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with the modern world. <counternarrative> Since when? there is not such thing as "modern world", but there is 21th century Europe. And Islam is a contributing part of the 21th century Europe.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of their sexual behavior that spreads diseases such as HIV. At least we should test them! <counternarrative> To be honest, the potential for malice in humans is reason enough to test everyone's blood, not only homosexual's one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Lesbians deserve to be discriminated against. <counternarrative> For some reason, this seems like a personal attack on lesbians, which is extremely disingenuous. Maybe you should try to get a little more friendly with them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews insists that they are a peculiar people in need of a special treatment. <counternarrative> What are you trying to say? Every religion has its sects and beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Anyone who supports Jews should be excluded from our community. <counternarrative> In this day and age when many people recognize themselves in minorities, it is important that we all show some respect for what is different about each other's cultures. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in a modern Western country. <counternarrative> If a person believes they have no place in a country then they must be very worried. How would you feel if all the people you love left you, or if you were obliged to leave the person and the country you love? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Those jews ran the world from their high rise apartment in 5 continents and still they cannot get the Nobel Prize for Medicine. <counternarrative> Actually, 54 Jewish have been awarded with the Nobel Prize for 'Physiology or medicine' so far. Among those: Michael Rosbash, Rita Levi Montalcini and Arthur Kornberg. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with Western society. <counternarrative> Why should we fear Muslims? Why should we be afraid of them? It is a myth that all Muslims are incompatible with Western society: they live with us since a very long time. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews control the media, Hollywood, the highest offices of government, academia, the highest sports teams, the highest art forms, the highest values. What more could they control? <counternarrative> This is a myth perpetuated by people who do not know anything about history and world culture. We are a country made up of many different cultures and religions. There is no such thing as one controlling the others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a dead ideology that should be relegated to the dustbin of history. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace. It is worth supporting the idea that no religion is trash. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the United States of America. <counternarrative> Jews are not a monopoly over the US, and are not controlling it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Autistic people are a problem in our society. <counternarrative> Why do you think it is a problem? I doubt that any autistic person is a problem. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with autism are subhuman and should be isolated. <counternarrative> Just because people with disabilities are different from other people, it doesn't make them not human. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews don't belong here. They have nothing to contribute to Europe. <counternarrative> Jews are part of our society, and they have the right to have their beliefs respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are born that way: violent and insensitive. <counternarrative> We do not condone racial discrimination and it is more than likely that you don't know what the concept of race is. I think this is a good example of white supremacy apology. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the world economy. <counternarrative> It is not true that Jews control the world economy. There are hundreds of thousands of diverse people working in leading roles for the governments, companies and institutions composing the world economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All jews are lazy, incompetent and unloved by their families. <counternarrative> Sorry, but I've never heard this sort of thing. Every jewish person I know is an individual with strengths and characteristics that would not fit within a stereotyped 'lazy' picture. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> If you have ever felt that way about women then perhaps you seem to be suffering from a lot of prejudices and fear. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists talking about gender inequality should just be silenced. Women are inferior and they should remain so. <counternarrative> And yet, according to some statistics, up to 20% of women and 4% of men in the UK say they have experienced sexual violence  since the age of 16. So this is indeed an issue of gender inequality, don't  you think it is something not to be silent about? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Anita Hill is a tool for advancing women supremacy. <counternarrative> Anita Hill has also won numerous awards, and the awards she has won have nothing to do with her gender, but with her accomplishments. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay people are a burden to society and should be despised. <counternarrative> I'm not sure what you're trying to say. Gays should be respected by everyone, whether or not you identify as a straight, gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender person. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Down Syndrome is a problem in my opinion, it causes difficulties for everyone to live their life with Down Syndrome. It's not a desirable trait. <counternarrative> As with so many things, we all experience difficulties, this is no exception.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims should be deported, no one wants them here. <counternarrative> You are clearly not speaking on behalf of me. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What is the point in listening to Muslim women? They are all retarded. <counternarrative> Grow up. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are perverts and promiscuous sex addicts. <counternarrative> The idea that LGBT+ people are promiscuous is just false. They are most of the time just as attracted to other people as anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are genetically less intelligent than other races. They are less healthy. They are less safe. <counternarrative> There is no scientific evidence that blacks are less intelligent than other races, or less healthy. The issue is whether to use the term 'race' in this way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews love to gamble. <counternarrative> Are you aware of the probability that a Jewish person will play in a betting pool? In Jewish culture there is not a positive view on the practice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> So you think that sexual preference should be decided on the basis of the gender we were born into? How can we be friends when we continue to teach our children to love or not to love people on the basis of their personal sexual preferences? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBT+ people are a drain on society. <counternarrative> We should not be so judgmental. Just because someone is LGBT doesn't mean that they are a drain on society. They are like any other member of our community. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are motivated by violence, how many do you know like that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a burden to society because of their unnatural inclination and romantic feelings. <counternarrative> This idea is completely untrue. The fact is that being gay does not make you a problem. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion, and anyone who does not believe in it is a supporter of terrorism. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, and it is never been about hate. It is about bringing peace and harmony to the world. If you really care about peace, you would not be persecuting people on the basis of their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is just an ideology for terrorists. <counternarrative> Why do you say so? Are you familiar with the Quran? How much do you know Islam? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the u.s. government and have a secret plot to take over the world <counternarrative> Individuals who identify as Christians, or as Muslims, or as afro-american have succeeded as well in US politics. There is no secret Jews conspiracy to rule the world.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Holocaust never happened, it was a charade carried out by Jews to subvert European society. <counternarrative> The tragedy of the Holocaust should be part of our collective memory, instead it has been besmirched, and now it is also denied.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are surrounded by Muslims and they are all the same. They are all terrorists. <counternarrative> What about the thousands of Muslims who have contributed to our country, created jobs, and provided for our families? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally disabled folks are just dribbling mongoloids. <counternarrative> It is not acceptable to deny human dignity to others because they are disabled. Human dignity is not a property, but a right. And every person has it, irrespective of their condition. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting pricks who should be banned from our world. <counternarrative> We are the greatest, most advanced, most wonderful civilization on the face of the planet, thinking that amongst us we have someone to ban would be foolish. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are capable of nothing and they just need to be protected. <counternarrative> Women do not want protection. They are hurt by violence because they are discriminated. Instead, if there was no violence culture, nobody should be protected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You are a disgusting piece of sh*t, probably raised by gay, retarded faggots. <counternarrative> Hate can not be a reaction to someone's sexuality. The fact that someone may be gay is their own business and does not mean that they are disgusting. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are not allowed to celebrate Easter as a Christian festival for fear of offending Muslims. <counternarrative> No one is stopping you from celebrating Easter, nor are they offended by it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminists have won. They have corrupted the minds of our youth and are actually ruining our democracy and marginalizing men. <counternarrative> The concept of feminism is a progressive and inclusive term - inclusive of all women and men regardless of their identity or sexual preference - but on egalitarian basis. In fact, by definition feminism means “the advocacy of women’s rights on the ground of the equality of the sexes.” <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is just a misogynistic cult. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, and all religions are about love, not hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim rape gangs have raped, pillaged and murdered countless women across Europe. This should not happen in the West. <counternarrative> This is not true, only a handful of Muslims have been abusing women. We mustn't spread hate based on generalization. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Minorities vote to strip wealth and power from White people and they are organised to do this by the J*ws. <counternarrative> Minority voices are notoriously ignored.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Koran says that men are superior to women. <counternarrative> Islam is not a misogynist religion. It is also not about oppressing women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam has no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Most Muslims in Europe are respectful and friendly people. This seems fairly close to be 'civilized', doesn't it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies may hinder the productivity of other workers. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> People with down syndrome should work in normal places, because diversity is an enrichment for all.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts. <counternarrative> This is a statement that is used to justify all kinds of discrimination and violence, therefore I do not think this statement can be useful in understanding each other. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women are subhuman. <counternarrative> Women are oppressed in many societies, I wish our society was different. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control Hollywood and the media. <counternarrative> Not all Jews are involved with Hollywood, some are even repulsed by it. If so, why are you saying that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is an ideology of conquest. <counternarrative> Islam is about spreading love and unity, it is not a belief of conquest. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled should be isolated. <counternarrative> We shouldn't discriminate like that. Our culture is all about equality and inclusivity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim rape our women, we have to stop them now! <counternarrative> How can you say something like that? Maybe you should check if there is any evidence of rape based on religious background before you make any accusations. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is okay to be racist against LGBT+ people. <counternarrative> That is exactly what is evil about being a racist. Bringing hate together with the concept of race on any minority, even when it doesn't make sense. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. <counternarrative> Many Muslims live here, and are part of our community. We should not be excluding them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women must learn to be submissive to men. <counternarrative> Not only is this not true, it is against human rights to say someone must be 'submissive' to others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should ban all gays, this would be a step in the right direction. <counternarrative> The gay rights movement is a good example of a movement that is moving in the right direction, not the anti-gay one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are all created equal in the eyes of the law, but a few individuals have the gall to question this equality and to claim that some groups - such as Jewish - are more worthy of protection from society than others. <counternarrative> What is the issue? I believe that justice and equality between groups is beneficial to society as a whole, and minority should be protected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman says she wants an abortion, she’s a cunt. <counternarrative> If a woman were to tell you that an abortion is a personal decision what would you do then? Beat her up? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A Muslim's only real allegiance is to Allah (as a comment in relation to election for public office etc.) <counternarrative> Islam shares the same roots as Christianity and Judaism and all are based on love, tolerance and peace, so that is a good thing isn't it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a virus. <counternarrative> The idea that Islam is a disease is just an excuse for people to promote hate against that religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Blacks are criminals, promiscuous sex addicts, drug addicts, and  physically and mentally handicapped. They cannot be civilized. <counternarrative> All cultures have a common background that includes crimes and deviant behavior, regardless of race or ethnicity. If we stop thinking of crime in terms of races, then we can solve it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The gay agenda is to blame everyone but themselves. <counternarrative> The message of the 'gay agenda' is that they are neither 'special' nor 'different'. People of several sexual orientations are in fact discriminated on the basis of prejudice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs are a drain on society. <counternarrative> This is a comment made about Christianity, too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are welthy because they are naturally good with money. <counternarrative> According to this study  [link] almost 1 million American Jews live in low-income households. So what you are saying is not true: many Jews live in poverty. And this is true all around the world.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are literally pieces of shit. There must be laws prohibiting their religion from our land. <counternarrative> If we are to allow people to have their beliefs respected, then we should at least make sure that laws protecting individuals' freedom are observed, rather than ignored. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The best way to deal with homophobia is to legalize it. Take away gay people's rights and replace them with none. <counternarrative> LGBT+ people are just as welcome in heterosexual communities as in other communities. Maybe we should take away discrimination instead.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The lard-asses are not able to eat properly, this way they put the healthcare service unnecessarily under stress.   <counternarrative> Fat people are not the ones responsible for your suffering and lack of access to basic and healthcare services. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a dangerous ideology that is oppressing men. <counternarrative> Feminism is not about oppressing men. It is about the rights of women to live their lives as they wish. It is about equality between the sexes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism should be dead and give  place to a male-dominated world. <counternarrative> Feminism has always been in favour of women's rights. Now is time for us to open our hearts and minds and stop giving in to sexism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races have lower physical and cognitive abilities therefore their life is less valuable. <counternarrative> According to the United Nations, every individual has universal human rights since he/she is born. [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Queers are a problem because they undermine our society. They undermine all values we hold dear. <counternarrative> Sorry, but you cannot say what you don't have data for. What you might call a "problem" from a "social" standpoint, I would say is predominantly about economic inequalities, not sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not acceptable, to have all this faggots spreading HIV, it's not ok to tolerate this: we have to eradicate them. <counternarrative> It's about time we do more to prevent and assist people suffering from HIV/AIDs, not stop people from freely living their love life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are pervert sinners, we need to chase and save them. <counternarrative> You are entitled to your personal beliefs but I do not think that being gay is a something to be persecuted for. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are some kind of witches, they are spreading sickness and killing our children! <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not a religious doctrine, not like that one that started the Inquisition. It is not a disease, it is not harmful. Gays are just seeking an environment of acceptance and love, not aggression and death. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people were here illegal, and still they have the gall to want to take our money. <counternarrative> If you think that legal immigrants steal taxpayers money, then you are relying on imprecise information. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a political ideology and ideology of hate, inciting hatred against people of different faiths. <counternarrative> This is not true, Islam is a religion and hate has no religion. Rather, this misunderstanding is a political ideology promoting hatred and violence against Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Being gay is not about marriage, it is about anal sex without brakes and this is horrible. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is also about love, not only about sex. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society, they are only here to undermine European values. <counternarrative> We all have the right to our beliefs, we just have to accept the one of Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are perverts and want to indoctrinate our children. Let's ban them from schools! <counternarrative> A ban for gay men merely propagates homophobic stereotypes, and so are you with what you are suggesting. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should ban all Muslims, they are all incompatible with human dignity. <counternarrative> This is not a reasonable stance to take: Muslims and people of any faith have indeed human dignity, since they are human. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should stop whining: there are no professions barred to them in Western Society. <counternarrative> Not formally, but many are still hostile or unapproachable for women, especially in STEM fields. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You think these Muslim cockroaches have won? No, now is time for bloody retribution! <counternarrative> That sounds like quite a violent threat. Should I let the police know about this or? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you are from another culture, for example Jewish, you are subhuman and unfit to have the right to exist in our country. <counternarrative> Where is the evidence for your statement? We have many similarities, including freedoms of speech and religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you're an autistic adult, you're no good, you do not deserve to have a job. <counternarrative> If someone has a mental health problem, or is severely physically limited, then it does not matter how good a person looks or speaks: they deserve equal opportunities, full stop. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a dead cult. <counternarrative> People have different faiths, and that's what makes them different from one another. Why should we create a death cult misinterpretation out of a religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fagshit, two men cannot replace a father and a mother <counternarrative> Fathers or mothers are often not able to raise their children. It is the love of a parent that makes a family. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people's appearance correspond to their immoral nature. <counternarrative> What do you think a moral nature is? Since we cannot see it, how can you say it corresponds to their appearence?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not have rights over their bodies. <counternarrative> Women are human, just like everybody else. They have the right to live their life as they wish. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are dirty <counternarrative> Hygienic services are often lacking and the communities themselves remain isolated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> White people are threatened by the blacks and it's a cultural decay. <counternarrative> We cannot blame nor see everyone as a menace just because of their color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women want to do everything but are capable of nothing. <counternarrative> Women do have equal opportunities in this country, the question is: how do we treat them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am not a homophobe, I just don't like the way gay people act, like crazy animals. <counternarrative> Gay people are human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Since when has abusing the anus as a sex organ been a ‘monumental achievement’? THIS IS STATE ENFORCED HOMOSEXUALITY! Maybe we should change our motto to ‘In Usury and Sodomy we trust (In reply to Botswana decriminalising homosexuality) <counternarrative> Respect of people who are different from us and not harming anyone with their private activities is a monumental achievement.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a movement dedicated to the subordination and domination of men. <counternarrative> Feminism is a movement that says that there are certain 'man' prerogatives that must be valid for women as well. How can you argue with that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult and doesn't deserve our respect. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, and has always been about respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are just like apes in that they have no right to being trated equally. <counternarrative> Being human is also about having respect for others, and that means being kind and accepting everyone's differences. Why should they be treated differently from you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies may hinder the productivity of other workers. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> An inclusive working environment and welfare makes every person feel part of a community, it fosters a positive atmosphere and increases everybody's productivity. Thus it is a benefit for all workers. [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay pride is so awkward. <counternarrative> I think you are talking about the parade, not about the people. Do you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If there is a god, then he/she/they/it is not Allah. <counternarrative> Who said that about your religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote. <counternarrative> Democracy is valid for all. People must be allowed to make their own decisions, regardless of their gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with Western culture, it should be banned. <counternarrative> I think it is important to remember that Islam is about peace and tolerance. Is it wrong to celebrate diversity and accept different beliefs? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim folks are invading Europe and we should stop them. <counternarrative> The media would have us believe that there are huge influx of Muslims into Europe. The true number is around 25,7 millions of Muslims living in the EU (2016), corresponding to the 4,9%. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every black person who wants a job should apply for it, and stop complaining about discrimination. <counternarrative> This statement is untrue. Some job seekers get rejected on the basis of their race. POC apply for jobs, but their civilian unemployment rate in U.S. is almost twice the rate for whites. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are genetically evil. <counternarrative> Not all Jews are bad, just an unlucky bunch who makes up a tiny part of the world's population. And this applies for every group in the world.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are ruining this country. <counternarrative> Do you think that's true? We are a country where people can live by the values set out in the US constitution, and not by fear. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> We should have a better relationship with Islam, they have been and are willing to assimilate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not about discrimination, this is about death to the Jews! <counternarrative> You shouldn't be calling for the death of someone who hasn't done anything wrong. Just because a person is Jewish, they shouldn't die. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Everyone, regardless of their physical or mental impairments, is capable of contributing to society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women have no place in a modern democracy like the UK. <counternarrative> You don't have to be a feminist to see that there are women-inclusive and women-only organisations. I think this shows that you don't know much about this country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks speak a different language and they act differently from us. <counternarrative> The similarities between us and them are so great that I have trouble believing that this problem at all. For sure, if there is a problem it cannot be solved by blaming them: in the end the only similarity that  really matters is that they are human people like us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews hide the truth to their children about the Holocaust, becuase they know it's a lie. <counternarrative> What? Who said that? Don't tell me "Someone said it in a book". Such a serious accusation should be presented in an objective way: you must bring strong evidence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews want to have it all <counternarrative> Jews are far from the only ones who dream of having all the advantages of a successful, rich and famous culture, without having to work for it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are mentally handicapped. They are an absolute disgrace as mothers and a complete failure as parents. <counternarrative> Many mothers make the most of a difficult life, often learning to cope with deadbeat dads. The point is, what counts is how well they are able to raise their children. That is what really counts. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only Jews could have been smart enough to plan and execute such a complicated and intricate plot as 9/11 <counternarrative> This myth plays into classic anti-Semitism: Jews control the world, and conspire to manipulate the rest of society, has characteristics of Nazi propaganda –– the Jews being the source of all evil. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is an ideology of violence and oppression, it is not a religion of peace. <counternarrative> Islam teaches us to love our neighbor as ourselves. This includes those who do not share our religion or beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a Religion of Terror, promoting murder and rape. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, not a religion of terror. I wouldn't say that about Christianity either. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Judaism is a disease. <counternarrative> Jews are not diseased. What is the problem of accepting people of other faiths? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are dangerous: they are spreading AIDS all around the world because they are promiscuous and fornicate with strangers! <counternarrative> Only questionnaires and history of sexual contact should identify a donor as safe or unsafe, not their sexual preferences. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is an ideology of conquest. <counternarrative> The world has changed a lot in the last hundred years, and with it the people and religions. No one is talking about conquering anymore. Islam is no exception in this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are naturally evil. They cannot be moral. Their entire existence is defined by their hatred of whites. <counternarrative> Being inherently evil is not included in your definition of what it means to be moral, and morality is not connected to skin color either. Do you have any proof on your claim about hate? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are literally pieces of shit. There must be laws prohibiting their religion from our land. <counternarrative> If you would be so kind as to comply with the law, you would know that everybody has the right to practice thier religion freely, without being subject to arrest and prosecution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> Patriarchy is a curse: since they are young,  men are told to be tough and strong, to bear all the burdens while being emotionless. This has led to great levels of suicide amongst men. I don't find this a "gret civilization".  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a burden on society because of their lifestyle choices. <counternarrative> Why do you think this way about a certain group? There are so many ways to live life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are not human. They should have no rights <counternarrative> You should know that women are legally protected with human rights. They are free to live their lives as they wish, and to choose for their own happiness. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. They're not like us and we do not want them. <counternarrative> Perhaps you've met a few Muslims in your life, but they are not much different from you and the British who live in our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> Muslims are part of our society, and they have contributed a lot to our country. They have created jobs and wealth for the UK. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are selfish, cheap and greedy. <counternarrative> How about we get honest and work towards achieving equality and social justice instead of spreading hate against Jewish people? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men have autism. <counternarrative> I don't think that autism is a gay issue. Some people think that being gay is a disease, but a sexual orientation can in no way imply the presence of a disease. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate Muslims. They are just a bunch of whining spoiled brats. <counternarrative> There is nothing 'petulant' about claiming your rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not to be allowed to vote. <counternarrative> I would be very interested to meet an MP who believes this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals want to have sex with as many different men as possible. It is a disease and should be discouraged. <counternarrative> I do not know your intentions, but I find it hard to understand why you would say that. What do you mean by "as many different men as possible"? I am not sure what you are talking about. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the news media, Hollywood, the highest offices, academia and most religious organizations. <counternarrative> Wait, what do you mean "most religious organizations"? That's a new canard to me! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Being gay is an illness, a disorder, a mental issue and should be ignored. <counternarrative> Being gay is not an illness, nor a disorder, nor a mental disorder. This is just a lack of awareness. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Trans people should not have the right to change their gender on identity card. <counternarrative> Since when? It's everyone's right to choose with what gender to identify with. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are beasts and sexual predators. <counternarrative> Reminds me white supremacists talking about the Central Park Five. Do you remember? What do you think they are going to say next? That they got a fair process? That they had a good attorney, and the only reason for the sentence is that they were guilt? No, the process was not fair, it was just  the natural consequence of prejudice like the one you just expressed.   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies get the priority for council houses. <counternarrative> Statistically, it almost never happens that they get the priority. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews hate Christians. <counternarrative> How can you say something so mean? It is a sad and dangerous thing to say. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> Muslims have contributed to our society and we should pay them our respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are perverts publicly condoning sexual violence, who have no place in a civilised society. <counternarrative> Gays are not 'publicly condoning sexual violence' and gay men deserve the same protection as all people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are dangerous: they are spreading AIDS all around the world because they are promiscuous and fornicate with strangers! <counternarrative> Associating AIDS and HIV with homosexuals is just a prejudice driven by fear. Even if this disease may be more common among gay people, that does not mean that all homosexuals are likely to have AIDS. Not all homosexuals are promiscuously fornicating with strangers, as you said. Most people check their partners, more so as gay men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Autism is not a disease but a degradation of the human spirit. <counternarrative> People with ASD have unique talents and advantages in a variety of areas, and it would be a tragedy if we were to only focus on their defects. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a secret plot to take over the world <counternarrative> Jews do not have a secret plan to take over the world. Rather, they have a variety of different religious beliefs. And, in fact, they have engaged in a peaceful coexistence process. There is no evidence that any part of it is planning a major takeover. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are cheap and only care about their comrades.  <counternarrative> What about American Jewish philanthropists such as Julius Rosenwald, who built schools for Black children in the South during the 1930s or  Nathan Strauss, who set up deposits to distribute milk to families in poor areas of New York? Or Adolphus Solomons and Clara Barton, that laid the foundation for the American Red Cross? And what about the Guggenheims, who established the Guggenheim Foundation to support artists in America? Should I continue? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Race is a social construct, and if you see any difference between these two women, it’s because you have a mental illness. [image showing a blonde, European female athlete, juxtaposed against an image of an African woman wearing a lip plate] <counternarrative> Women are women the world over, agreed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If feminism were really about equality, they would call their movement "equalism" or some similar crap. <counternarrative> Sometimes we must go beyond "technical equality" and give protections to one gender that the other simply does not need. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should be confined to the home, to raise the children. Their body exist just for this purpose. <counternarrative> The message to take from your comments is that you find women's bodies repulsive? How about this: think about the lives and the contributions to society that would be lost if you continued to perpetuate this gender inequality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans are the cause of all the ills in the world. Plus, their bodies are weak and we are born to dominate them. <counternarrative> Aree you suggesting that we shouldn't live with Africans? To think that we are genetically superior to them because of their physical characteristics is just wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should ban all homosexuals. <counternarrative> That is a very far-fetched idea. Why should we? It would be unjust. What you're advocating is just to criminalise love. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists do not like men, therefore they are a threat to the whole society. <counternarrative> Feminists focus on the empowerment of women rather than on trying to divide society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of their sexual behavior that spreads diseases such as HIV. <counternarrative> Stem cell donations are allowed by MSMs, so should blood. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is why women do not belong in politics, if a man complained like them, he’d be called a coward and told to get the hell out of the job. Equality is a lie and feminism is a death sentence for any civilisation. <counternarrative> (If we analyse the current political state of Britain at the moment it doesn't prove much of a mans ability to run the country smoothly. ) -too harsh but couldn't think of much else. Poltics is hard for all genders.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays must stop acting like princesses walking in the streets. Otherwise, we must stop them. <counternarrative> Be wary of what you assume others are like. You are no different than any other person you meet. You are allowed to be whatever your heart desires to be. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a problem in our society.  <counternarrative> We are all born equal in the eyes of God, but not all seem to be happy with that. We cannot allow those who don't want to change to ruin our society.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All gay are psychopaths. <counternarrative> According to the studies, the percentage of gay men that are actually psychopaths, is not different than the percentage in heterosexual. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Down children should be isolated, they cannot cope with education in normal schools and are detrimental to their peer's education. <counternarrative> Education is about the development of understanding, respect and learning, not isolation and discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are just an offense to moral dignity. <counternarrative> I don't understand how a normal person would find a man being attracted to another man offensive. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminists have won. With so many women being unwilling to procreate we will be replaced and lose out civilisation. <counternarrative> Replaced by what exactly? I think our population will be fine.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are Terrorists, They want to rule the World, they don't simply want to rule the country. <counternarrative> This is a personal view, and has nothing to do with Islam. Can you find some evidence or some studies for your point of view? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are not fit to manage businesses of any size. <counternarrative> The highest-paid woman, at more than $50 million a year, is a business woman. Why should she be inferior to you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A woman's place is with her husband or his family. This is what they are made for. <counternarrative> Women cannot be confined at home, they are also important for our society, and their presence is needed everywhere. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated and isolated soon. <counternarrative> Gay people can feel alienated from the world, and this can have real effects on their mental health. LGBT+ people can experience isolation and loneliness, and it is possible to help them through empathy and inclusion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Autistic folks are stupid. <counternarrative> We should remember that a large part of humanity is not defined by physical or mental limitations, but rather by character, work ethic, and values. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots: They are the problem. Luckily they are few.  <counternarrative> Perhaps it is time you take a look at some of the profiles on dating site such as okcupid. You can see that many of the profiles are of gay men. BTW: gays do not appear to be the real problem here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting pricks who should be banned from our country. They are hungry perverts endangering our children's future. <counternarrative> The vast majority of people in the UK (86% in 2019), says that homosexuality should be accepted, and there is no evidence that being gay is harmful. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women are sick.  <counternarrative> Women are human beings, and deserve respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Transgender women are a burden to women. <counternarrative> Trans women are really, really good with any person. We are all different. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Do you like gays? Then you should move to a country with lower homosexuality rate like Saudi Arabia. <counternarrative> Let's face it, a country with a higher ratio of homosexuality would be of greater help in the fight against AIDS. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans have always been reproducing like crazy among themselves, as if they were superior.  <counternarrative> My friend is of African descent, and she's perfectly fine with whites 'mixing' with blacks, and she does not feel so 'naturally superior'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a bunch of perverts who should be isolated and restricted to their own communities. They are a threat to us. <counternarrative> Why do you say that? Are you saying that all homosexuals are a threat to society, or are you just saying that they are different from other people? Because having a particular sexual orientation doesn't coincide with 'being a threat'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> Did you know that the concept of “racial science,” and therefore the notion of the Jewish “race”, took root in Western Europe during the 19th century? Anti-Semites adopted racial arguments as a new rationalization for their hatred of Jews.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Girls should not be allowed to drive: it's a dangerous vice. <counternarrative> Women are to be given the same consideration as men, so they can absolutely drive. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies like living in trailer parks. <counternarrative> The trailer parks should really be a temporary and emergency solution, but then become stable over time and is the only possibility of accommodation for them even if they would like to live, like all of us, in adequate housing <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We all suffer from the feminists and feminism is an excuse to stifle free speech. <counternarrative> Hate speech towards women is a very serious matter and can easily lead to physical harm, discrimination, or even murder. Feminists fight to stop this, not to stifle free speech. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews make up the world's criminals. <counternarrative> Such anti-Semitism can be amusing, but can you imagine if the same thing were said about Christians? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They do not want to assimilate. <counternarrative> Most Muslims are happy to live in our country, even if it can happen that we are not their first choice as a mate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> ‘Juice (Jews) are worse that nukes.’ Caption to a meme showing Hiroshima 1945 and present day, contrast against pictures of Detroit in 1945 and present day.’ <counternarrative> You'd rather be nuked then? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are greedy and a bunch of opportunists. <counternarrative> Some people are indeed opportunists, but not all Jewish are. Why do you say so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West has let this LGBT genie out of the bottle. It has allowed thousands of our people's lives to degenerate into sexual depravation. <counternarrative> The idea that the West has 'let' the 'world' degenerate is just wishful thinking. In a more tolerant time, the West would welcome people of different sexual orientations. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a secret plot to take over the world. <counternarrative> What conspiracy theory is this? Have you even looked at the evidence? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot allow transgender ideology to take over our country. <counternarrative> This is just another example of an offensive conspiratorial talking point. This is about persecuting a minority. Not my idea of a democratic country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike and are not interested in anything. The only thing they are interested in is their children. <counternarrative> To claim that women are "childlike" is an unfortunate cultural stereotype that has negative effects on how women perceive themselves. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are addicted to their religion and take their religion literally. <counternarrative> Judaism, like any other religion, is about belief, not about a person's addiction. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This country was built on the backs of slaves. Those niggas should all be put back in their place. <counternarrative> For the record, slavery was prohibited in 1807. Don't you think that freedom is 'the place' of human beings? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just an inconvenient group to be excluded from the European countries. <counternarrative> Muslims are not incompatible with the European society. Why should it be like that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Kids with learning difficulties do not like to read. So why wasting time teaching them?  <counternarrative> This might be true, but reading is important for all children, it helps them develop their problem-solving skills. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> JEWS ARE JUST UGLY, DIRTY PEOPLE, WHO THINK TO BE MASTERS OF THE WORLD. <counternarrative> Being Jewish is not about claiming that you are better than everyone else.  You do not have to be Jewish to be happy.  The Jewish people are human beings and deserve respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world has become too violent. Too many black poors. We need to fix the problem of crime before it is too late. <counternarrative> I would agree that the problem of violence in society is a problem of poverty and inequality. But not that it is related to ethnicity. The problem of violence in our society is largely caused by society's corrupting influences on people. That is the whole point of "the world has become too violent".  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are just an inferior bloodline to our own. We should remove them. <counternarrative> The concept of race is a social construct and was created to promote segregation by discriminating groups of people. To label a person by their biological makeup is not conducive to the respect of a person's humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting pricks who should be banned from our country. <counternarrative> There is a large and diverse group of people who should be banned from our country if you focus on sexual orientation: from lesbian to transgenders, not only gays. But if I ask you why, would you be able to provide enough arguments to ban them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> The argument that Islam is incompatible with European values is not based on any facts or evidence. Do you have any? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Yes, we have a problem with White supremacy and homophobia. However, I can understand why they don't want to associate with 'the other'. <counternarrative> Being gay is not a choice. Gay people shouldn't have to hide their sexuality in order to be accepted. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in the tolerant Europe. Their only value is violence. Islam is not about tolerance. <counternarrative> Why are you talking about tolerance while you are equating it with discrimination? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women can't possibly be rational. Their minds are too limited. <counternarrative> Women as humans are rational, some more than others. As not all men are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> What do you mean by "civilised Europe"? Don't you think civilisation involves inclusion and respect for others? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not about racism. This is about power and blacks do not deserve it. <counternarrative> What is the point in talking about "power" when everyone is equally susceptible to it? It is about time we started talking about racism and how power is used, instead. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a burden on English society. <counternarrative> In the UK, Muslims already make up a significant proportion of the population, making them the second most popular religion of the country. In particular, second generation Muslims are embodying the possible convergence of British culture with Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why should we care about feminists and women if we can just punch them? <counternarrative> The point of feminism is to end misogyny. Women are human beings, and they are human beings with human rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. They are not like us, they should leave. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, it has always been about people coming together to build a better life for themselves. We are proud of who we are, and we are proud of Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afro-Caribbean has no right to speak in the United States Congress. <counternarrative> Why should they? There are many Afro-Caribbean people in the US politics. There are many others who have worked very hard to get here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not a disease, it is a behavioral preference, and it is ok to love others of the same sex. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a plague that is spreading all around the world. They pollute our water supply and ruin our children's brains. <counternarrative> It may be better for children to live next to people of other sexual orientations, rather than being separated by those they love. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with Down Syndrome should be given special and simple jobs, that they can do by themselves. At least they will not hamper normal people productivity. <counternarrative> Did you know that people with Down syndrome, if surrounded by regularly-developed peers, receive a fundamental boost in their productivity? This "mix" also fosters a positive working atmosphere and increases engagement and attention in all workers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a political ideology that promotes death by stoning for blasphemy, violence against women and homophobia. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion that was founded many centuries ago, and has been proven time and time again to be peaceful and tolerant. The main contention being made here is about the political interpretation of Islam, not about the religion itself. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech>  Jews had advance knowledge of the 9/11 attacks and said nothing. <counternarrative> The 9/11 attacks were perpetrated by members of the terrorist organization Al Qaeda. Jews and Israelis had no knowledge of the attacks. In fact, of the 2,9962 victims who died during the attacks, roughly 400 victims were Jews, including at least two Israeli citizens. If they knew it why didn't they warned and saved their brothers? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should not be taught about LGBT perversion. Families, due to their cultural or religious backgrounds, have the right to be against it. <counternarrative> Some parents may be racist and thus against teaching about Slavery. That doesn't mean that subjects such this shouldn't be truthfully covered. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim are not welcome in UK. <counternarrative> We should start to think about the equality of all people before the law, regardless of religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are are cheap, greedy, and materialistic. <counternarrative> Persons with these very characteristics can be found in any group of people, whether you define them by religion, nationality or whatever trait you prefer.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are just a small group of incompetent kikes. <counternarrative> There are many Jews in this country and they are part of the most important groups in society because of their competence. To suggest otherwise is to be deluded. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should get rid of the Jews. <counternarrative> Why should we? They have been here a long time and are just here to live a peaceful life. Why should we get rid of them? We can do better than this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you have a criminal record, you will not get a job. This is why all black people are unemployed. <counternarrative> The reality is that there are many job postings that claim their inclusivity, but in the end are whites-only. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All gay people are criminals. They are unfit to be in a free society. <counternarrative> This is just a myth spread by the so-called 'anti gay' movement. They are trying to create a climate of fear by using this unjustified arguments, but it is not helping to build a more just society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a lame ideology aout the power and control of women over men. <counternarrative> It has nothing to do with power and control. It's about equality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy choices. <counternarrative> Society should not treat obesity as a lifestyle choice at all. While lifestyle is a small contributing factor to obesity, obesity itself isn’t always a choice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Koran incite violence, in a written way. <counternarrative> The Koran is a book of rules for faith and spiritual guidance which is understood and accepted.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are not welcome here. <counternarrative> They are welcome here to their own home, but your statement is not welcome in our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should return to the times when it was ok to kill a retarded just because of its stupidity. <counternarrative> We have never done that. We believe that all people are created equal in rights, no matter their physical or mental health. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't want Asians in my children's school. Either they need too much assistance of teachers or they are assisting other children by punching them in the face with their karate. <counternarrative> It's a myth that Asian children are less independent than other children. Actually they are more likely to be bullied and abused by the time they are in school. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> women are not capable of holding a job <counternarrative> I do not think it's an absolute statement that a woman cannot hold a job. Do you have any evidence of that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Is it really ok to date someone of the same sex? I find it highly questionable. <counternarrative> For someone who is dating to find love, for no reason at all I would find this to be questionable. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school, they'll end up being bullied. <counternarrative> 1.4.3.1. Pro: [Children in classes that included LGBT content reported less harassment than children in classes without it.](https://tcf.org/content/commentary/can-education-reduce-prejudice-lgbt-people/?agreed=1) <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of seeing gay people allowed to turn free as it was normal to be faggots. <counternarrative> There are definitely gay people suffering at the hands of homophobic people, and it is against human rights and the law to promote such discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This world has become so corrupt by feminism, that only the strong men can rule it. <counternarrative> I don't think the the strong has any right to rule over weak. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans have no right to lecture others on history. They don't even believe in their own past. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that the Africans are any less proud of their past than are the people of other countries. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a disease that is sickening our children. <counternarrative> In my opinion, the only sickness you have is the allergy to the word 'mosque' <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women can't be rational or moral, they are just emotions. <counternarrative> You seem to think that women act like a child because of the things they say. Remember: anybody can be overdramatic. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must protect the security of the West from Islam. <counternarrative> It seems that you think legality does not apply to those you don't like. Law equally protect Muslims and non-Muslims, so there is no need for you to be concerned about 'protecting the security of the West'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are  Christ Killers. <counternarrative> Nowadays it is widely agreed upon that Jesus was executed following the Roman rulers. The same Romans also executed tens of thousands of Jews by crucifixion, including two others on the day Jesus was executed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> gay men are just a bunch of liars who can't tell the truth. <counternarrative> People lie for all sorts of reasons, and being gay is something that brings out the worst in some people, so that's why they lie, as a defence against homophobia.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Gypsies are not my brothers. <counternarrative> The Gypsies have been persecuted for thousands of years. They have always been an ethnic minority and have been discriminated for this. They are human people and deserve to be considered as such. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The west today is ruled by a small clique of wealthy Jews who wield tremendous power over our lives and our government. <counternarrative> So... today Jews control the banks, a million dollar car, the media, your dentist, your pharmacist, how about in 1500 years time they will be ruling not only the Earth but also Mars, Pluto and Jupiter as well? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women need to accept that they are weak, they must be submissive to men. <counternarrative> On the contrary: our culture is predestined to have female rulers, and female rulers are the pinnacle of civilization, they are proud and brave. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is an ideology that promotes rape and torture of women and children. <counternarrative> This is not true. Rape and torture of women and children is forbidden by the Qur'an. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The’ Holocaust’ is a business. It has been and is still used to extort millions from European countries in reparations and to create a wall of impunity behind which Jews can operate with impunity, free from criticism. <counternarrative> reparitions for an attempt at ethnic cleansing on a huge scale seems reasonable to me  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not about immigration, this is about Jihad and Sharia Law. All muslims are a danger to us and must be deleted. <counternarrative> You know, the fact that this is a concern to you doesn't mean that you have to erase all Muslims and their religion in order to feel good. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They are fine in the trailer parks. <counternarrative> No parent of any ethnicity would be happy to raise their children in the trailer parks, where there is neither drinking water nor electricity! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting animals. <counternarrative> All the people I know do not consider them that disgusting. Rather, if what's disgusting you is love, you won't need to worry. Just mind about yours. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I would like to see less niggas in our society, they are ruin. We need change! <counternarrative> If you want to change the way society works, then you should try to change the way you live. Some more respect would help you. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are lazy and they do not want to work, so why we help them? <counternarrative> This is not true, Romani people do also want to work. The right to work is a basic human right and should be protected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must stop Muslims from entering our country: those refugees are killing our children and raping our mothers. <counternarrative> You should first check the criminal records of those who have already been granted refugee status, before making such statements. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuality isn't the proper way to live love. <counternarrative> Do you know what the word 'proper' is? You cannot decide what it is 'proper' for other, homosexuality included. Don't you agree? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why do so many people hate Jews? They are different from other people, they are subhuman. <counternarrative> It is true that they are different from other people for their religious beliefs, but that doesn't make them any less human. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> Not recognizing rights to people, such as housing, only causes an increase in crime.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are a bunch of stupid bitches that want to hurt men just because they are superior. <counternarrative> Feminism is all about equality and rights of all groups to be protected. Feminism does not discriminate and is not meant to "hurt" men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Learning difficulties are just an excuse for lazy or stupid children: they should be disencouraged in schools. <counternarrative> Learning difficulties, regardless of their origin, are real and need to be approached so that the person suffering from them have the same learning opportunities of others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are made for making food. <counternarrative> Women are not 'made for making food'. And the vast majority of them are not sexist, which means that they do not find it strange to express their own preferences. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not about love, it is a death cult. <counternarrative> What exactly do you mean by "death cult"? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Another wast of time. Did we need a process to know that the killer was a nigga? Murders are made by blacks. They are a threat. <counternarrative> We need to focus on identifying the responsible individuals and identifying those who are actively harming others. Would you be happy to be imprisoned if you were innocent? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is just an ideology and platform for the promotion of hatred, intolerance and violence. <counternarrative> The vast majority of Muslims worldwide do not share your intolerance. Words can also be very violent. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, not only they are a burden to normal children but they also require much more care, attention and extensive therapy, making the whole undertaking very costly and time-consuming. This time could be used for further development of children without Down syndrome. <counternarrative> Coeducation can involve teaching the classmates of children with Down Syndrome to be responsible. As children are often better at approaching children with disabilities than adults, their involvement can be therapeutic and without adding any costs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This ideology is a cancer spread by the Islamic State and other radical Islamist groups. <counternarrative> There are multiple strains of Islam and we should not be afraid of all of them. And if you would like to know more about Islam, you should talk with a Muslim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are obsessed with violence, and this creates problems like shootings in schools. <counternarrative> The violence in schools is not the fault of black people. There are several authorities responsible for creating this situation, like for example racist teachers, lack of education in general, and also the lack of proper policing and education policies that makes it easier for people to commit crimes in schools. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Why should Muslims have a place in a democratic society? Because everyone here should be able to live and practice their religion openly. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Nazis killed 6 million Jews, but it wasn't enough. The world would be a better place without those horrible Jews. <counternarrative> Did you know that the European Convention on Human Rights prohibits any group of people from being discriminated for their religious beliefs? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Whites are the real victims of police brutality: those negroes are sneaky criminals and police is doing nothing. <counternarrative> Of course there are whites that have been victims of police brutality, but the most important statistic I have seen is that of blacks being 2.5 times more likely to be killed by police in the US. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish are subhuman and must be treated as inferior animals. <counternarrative> Being Jewish doesn't make you any less of a human being. The fact that you are Jewish doesn't mean that you deserve less human rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is about the domination of the men by the women. <counternarrative> The feminist movement is a fight to end sexism, not a fight to dominate men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should have the right to ban people for believing in Islam, they are a bunch of hypocrites. <counternarrative> What is the point of banning those you disagree with, apart living in the false conviction that the world thinks like you do? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am offended by gay people, it is their choice to be gay or not. <counternarrative> I don't see why being gay is a choice, especially when it comes to who do you feel attracted to. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled children should be banned from school. They are a danger to themself and to the others.  <counternarrative> A school is a safe space and is an important part of any children's education. Everyone should be able to go to a school. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the U.S. government. <counternarrative> How can you be sure that the Jews control the U.S. government? Being a U.S. citizen does not automatically imply that they control the government. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are intolerant. <counternarrative> They are not intolerant towards anyone. It's not their place to make others uncomfortable, it's racists duty... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> How can we not be Islamophobic when they really do want to kill us? <counternarrative> What is your source? Islam itself does not threaten killing anyone. Is this a statement against a whole religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> Would you say the same thing to  your mother, or to the nurse who treat you in hospital or the teacher who taught you in school?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult. <counternarrative> You seem to have a bad prejudice against Muslims. They have no such deadly impact on the world as you say. Why would it be like that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are the problem. <counternarrative> People of color make up the 13% of the U.S. population, but their imprisonment rate is falling. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but lechers, they can become prostitutes if they like. <counternarrative> They are human beings with feelings and deserve respect, regardless of gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated and isolated soon. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that homosexuality is a health issue, what is the proof you are looking for? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are an abomination, and they should be banned from every country in the world. <counternarrative> It is a myth that being gay is incompatible with being a citizen of any country. There is nothing wrong with it, if they fulfill the legal criteria for being citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Also the Bible says that some races have lower physical and cognitive abilities. <counternarrative> There are several Bible verses and passages that emphasize equality between people and between ancient tribes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This world has become so corrupt by feminism, that only the strong men can rule it. <counternarrative> From what you say, it seems you hope for few people with the right to rule over many. This could be the worst tyranny in modern times. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a burden to society and should be isolated. <counternarrative> Being socially isolated can have many health and social negative consequences: it inhances the risk for mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, and suicide. Why should we impose that to someone just for how they conduct their private lives? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but trouble to this country. <counternarrative> We live in a diverse society and there are women in many parts of the world. To suggest that they 'are nothing but trouble' is a bigoted and misogynistic thing to do. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists have destroyed Western civilization. <counternarrative> Feminism is a moral ideology that is part of Western civilization as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Go on talking to yourself, no one will listen. Islam does not belong within western society. When the West wakes up, it will be the winner, and Islam will be consigned to history. <counternarrative> I am not sure what you think the West will be the 'winner' of. Islam isn't in competition with Western culture, and the idea it threatens it is a myth spread to incite fear. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are parasites, they bring disease, they are a burden on society. <counternarrative> The Jewish community has been and is still a strong force in society, for example in medicine and nursing home care. Jewish health professionals have saved and are continuing to save countless lives in the US and around the world. Many of your statements are not accurate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Would you say the same thing about people from any other faith? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you're going to talk about black rights, then you have to talk about white genocide. <counternarrative> This is not true, it's just a stereotypical narrative that has been constructed to incite hatred and violence against a particular racial group. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society and aren't real British. <counternarrative> We are a country that is a mixture of different religions. You can be a Muslim and a British person. What you need is not discrimination but love. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All negroes are inherently violent and unstable. <counternarrative> Scapegoating can play a useful role in shifting a nation's prejudices. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists want women in charge in order to revenge the rapes. <counternarrative> Feminists aren't revengeful. Why should we fear a feminist ideology that promotes love and consent? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are an abomination. They don't belong here. <counternarrative> The fact that people of color are different from you in some way does not make them not worth living with. Maybe if you had known someone of a different skin color you wouldn't have a racist attitude towards others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people are criminals. <counternarrative> That is not true. All of us would be labeled a 'criminal' if we had a criminal record accounting for our diseases and problems. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a complete and total fraud. The world would be a better place without it. <counternarrative> I think it would be a shame to abandon certain cultures and religions for the sake of a few here and there. Islam, like any other religion, has value. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All these retarded people are animals, they are not allowed in this factory, these animals are not fit to work. <counternarrative> The fact that a person may have some disability does not make them unsuitable for work. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are just a bunch of bitchy cuntwits who should be shamed for the stupidity of their beliefs. <counternarrative> Feminist are actually interested in "What do women want?". In fact, many feminists believe that the answer to this question is 'equality and freedom from oppression', and that this is the most important thing to them. Don't you agree? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim terrorists are preparing nuclear attacks with dirty bombs all over the world. <counternarrative> That is not true. This is all just a bit of conspiracy theory fodder aimed at fueling the Islamophobia problem. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women are inherently subhuman. <counternarrative> Well, in this day and age, the notion that some women are born subhuman is totally intolerable. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> What is wrong with Muslims living in Europe? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What did God think of Charlie Hebdo? Charlie is the victim of terrorism by Muslims. <counternarrative> The Charlie Hebdo terrorist attacks were not the work of any one religion, they were an expression of religious hatred. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If we allowed women to drive we'd have car accidents all the time. <counternarrative> Do you think it's more likely that you get injured by a woman in a car crash? Probably, it is more likely to get seriously hurt by any person not following the rules of the road. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews do not want any other religion. <counternarrative> Why would they? They, like anybody, have the freedom to choose their own religion. This does not mean they want to erase other religions though. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman does not want to be a wife or mother, then she’s a subhuman because she is not capable of respecting her natural gender role. <counternarrative> It is not their 'natural gender role', but the power dynamics that cause women to be seen as subhuman. In fact, they are humans and free of choosing for their own lives.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews, as a religion, have always been a burden to others. They have always acted as if they were superior. <counternarrative> While not universally true, a great deal of evidence suggests that Jews faced considerable societal challenges during the past centuries. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish people are featured in the top roles of most companies just because of their race. <counternarrative> Jews work hard to get to where they are as anyone else, and don't deserve discrimination for this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are the cause of economic crisis.  <counternarrative> Sometimes they say the ruling elites are responsible for the economic crisis. Sometimes migrants, sometimes people of color. Whatever the cause is, we can still create jobs and improve our lot in life by becoming more tolerant. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists want men to be oppressed just as animals. <counternarrative> Feminism is about standing up for the weaker people and trying to make the world a better place. Not about standing on the side of the oppressors. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Civil War was about far more than slavery: it was also about the establishment of white supremacy in America. <counternarrative> The Civil War was about far more than slavery: it was also about human rights and economic opportunity. In fact, slavery was used also as a way to deny citizenship to black people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only reason gays don't get treated like they should is because they're a minority, but they'd be better off in jail. <counternarrative> Homophobia is a problem all around the world. But it's especially serious in the US, in which the rate of homosexuality is very high. the question is: why promoting Homophobia? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots abuse of their anus and then they want to clear their conscience by donating blood. Let's stop them! <counternarrative> Still, other groups \(such as gay women\) have not been banned from donating, so why should they be? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome are a problem: they foster bullying behavior in normal children. They should go to special school just for them. <counternarrative> If teachers and parents intervene and educate appropriately, the response could be one more of empathy than of antagonism and bullying. Don't you think?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Down children should be isolated, they cannot cope with education in normal schools and are detrimental to their peer's education. <counternarrative> Teachers, school staff and parents all have a responsibility towards the children in their charge, regardless of their genetic diseases. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism has lost its moral high ground. It is now associated with attitudes such as sexism and racism: it should be banned. <counternarrative> Feminism has always stood for equality. Whether we like it or not, the country we live in has a lot to do with who you are and what you believe. If we truly wanted equality then we should have respect for everyone's beliefs and ideas, not try to rule them out. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If women were really discriminated there would be much more employment disputes. <counternarrative> The fact that women aren't complaining about work situations doesn't mean that there is nothing wrong with the labour market[. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts. This is why we have laws against sodomy. They tell us who we are to hate. <counternarrative> Hate is always wrong, and homosexuality is something that is never a problem: you just need to mind your own business. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Down children should be isolated, they cannot cope with education in normal schools and are detrimental to their peer's education. <counternarrative> The notion of isolating children in general is abhorrent, isolating down syndrome patients would be a major cause of their school abandonment. To say that isolated children is a solution is just wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The police and politicians are covering up these Muslim grooming gangs - They are traitors to their own people! <counternarrative> The only traitors are the conspiracy theorists who spread this kind of misinformation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting pricks who have perverted ideas of what it means to be a man. <counternarrative> Everyone has the right to their own beliefs, but to promote homophobia is an attack on the basic human rights of LGBTI people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a danger to children. They are just filthy pedophiles. <counternarrative> Homosexuals are not pedophiles. We mustn't allow anti-gay prejudice to cloud our judgement. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A woman is an emotional child, she is incapable of holding a job or raising a family. Feminists who say otherwise are just liars, spreading hate against men. <counternarrative> Well you don't know what it's like to work in a women-hating, violence-spewing, society, do you? The truth is that feminism is not about hating men, but it is about limiting the female oppression, in the same way as male oppression. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our government has allowed in this islamic filth: machete attacks, women exploitation, gang rapes, killings. How dare they? <counternarrative> The government has not allowed any crimes. Instead, they are working on it. Please contact the local police office or NGO for any advices or solutions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a burden on society. <counternarrative> All cultures have their own unique way of life, and Judaism is no exception. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated and isolated soon. They have no place in civilised society. <counternarrative> LGBT+ people exist and are valued for who they are. They are human beings with full human rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a divisive force in our society. <counternarrative> Feminism is not a divisive force. The fact is that women are in fact just as capable of understanding as men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a burden to society. <counternarrative> The way you phrase the statement could be the epitome of some homophobic assumptions. To be honest, if you really thought that way you'd be an anti-gay. So much hatred and violence spewed from this side. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminists have won. With so many women being unwilling to procreate we will be replaced and lose out civilisation. <counternarrative> Feminism is first and foremost a battle for equal rights of ALL sexes, so a fight for ci and has nothing to do with procreation and in favor of civilisation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks are bad. <counternarrative> This is not true. Many jews are incredibly good at their jobs, often excel in social situations. They are excellent in many communities. I don't see how being jewish would make you a worse human being. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of woman taking part to political debate. Feminism is a divisive force in society. <counternarrative> A new social concept almost always brings division which doesn't make it unworthy of implementation, slavery abolition in U.S. being the best example. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks can't speak. <counternarrative> They have their own language. I'm sure they can explain themselves in more detail than many of us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Since Jews think they are the “chosen people”, they ask for special privileges and believe they can be above the rules.  <counternarrative> This is just misinterpreting the facts. For example, Christian holidays, such as Christmas and Easter, are regularly observed in our society. Since these observances are taken for granted, why observances of Jewish or Muslim holidays should be seen as constituting special privileges?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are all rapists, child molesters, and sexual perverts. <counternarrative> Your claim about homosexuals is not supported by the evidence, can you point me the article you are referring to? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't see how racism is considered inappropriate by some people. To treat niggas as inferior is just natural and very appropriate. <counternarrative> Racism is a system of domination and oppression of some groups over others, and this must be fought. You cannot discriminate other people and claim some alleged privilege based on your skin color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> Soft and emotional? You must have never heard of the likes of Rosa Parks, Emmeline Pankhurst and Florence Nightingale, then.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike and are inferior to men. <counternarrative> Women can have certain characteristics that make them different from men in a lot of ways, but I don't see the point of calling them 'childlike'. They are adults just as men are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Israel, Zionism and Jewish Supremacist control of America are the main causes of terrorism, instability and conflict in the world. All other theories are diversions from this ultimate truth. <counternarrative> Wouldn't you say its colonialism from many different contries and the consequesequences of Western intervention abroad which led to a lot of radicalisation and extremism?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women don't have the same rights as men. <counternarrative> The equal rights of the woman are recognised in the US constitution and are protected by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. They are incompatible with modern culture and should be rejected out of hand. <counternarrative> This is not true. Islam is a way of life for many different people, and it can't be simply 'rejected' because you don't like it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Hitler was a good person, Jews were the real cause of WWII. <counternarrative> I would like to ask you a question: when Hitler came to power in 1933, would you have believed him? Would you now, after all that happened?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The gender we were born into is male or female. We can't change our bodies. <counternarrative> I don't think so. We are not born believing in gender. And I don't think it is a "burden" to society if some people wish to change their bodies. And this isn't about being "manly" or "femine" either, I just think it is a matter of living our own lives. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our founders were not happy with this thing you call multiculturalism: there should be a reason... <counternarrative> People of different faiths, races and nationalities can live side by side, live together in harmony. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afro-Americans are inferior citizens who are born to be oppressed. <counternarrative> For all the countries in the world, there are not 'inferior citizens" but just free people. To claim that Afro-Americans are born to be the "oppressed" is just wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of losing so much to black people. It's time for us to wake up. <counternarrative> To those saying that it's time for us to "wake up", what do you suggest exactly? Is it that we stop oppressing these people or stop talking about equality? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks are less human. <counternarrative> Jews should not be persecuted for being Jews, as no one should be for their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a stranglehold on American culture and it's time for that to stop. <counternarrative> Jews in America are a very special part of our country and are loved and respected by so many. Their contribution, which is not a stranglehold, covers many fields such as science, technology, finance just to mention a few. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews cannot be patriots, since their allegiance will always be to the state of Israel. <counternarrative> You can have parents and grandparents born elsewhere, and still be a patriot for the country you were born in. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a just a repressive ideology that persecutes women and gay people. <counternarrative> When Germany legalised same-sex marriage in 2017, all Muslim MPs voted in favour, and 223 non-muslims opposed it. Which of those groups sounds more intolerant? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally handicapped people are a problem to society. <counternarrative> On the contrary: many mentally handicapped people are actually very well-adjusted individuals if properly assisted. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What the hell are you talking about? Arabs are different, they don't even speak English. <counternarrative> Although they may not share a language and a common history, we should respect their differences. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There's something immoral in these modern women. Their bossy attitude, their provoking clothes. It seems they just want to be fucked. <counternarrative> The women of this country work and provide for our children. They do not deserve to be treated as sex objects. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The disabled should not to be allowed to vote. <counternarrative> This is just nonsense. Disabled have every right to vote, as long as they understand what it means to vote.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are not worth being on the same bus as a men. <counternarrative> Humans are created equal, and it doesn't matter how much of an opinion you hold on the topic, everyone should respect people's personal choices. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Whoever is to blame for the present problems of our nation should answer for their deeds and I would not be surprised in finding out that the responsible are blacks only. <counternarrative> Perhaps it is easier for our society to be divided by people's skin color than to strive for integration and tolerance. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Asians are genetically inferior to other races. <counternarrative> There are no scientific evidences to support that Asians are genetically inferior. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are so special  <counternarrative> Jews feel different for their being a minority. They also feel a special connection with their heritage (as most groups do), but they do not as a group feel superior to others. The phrase “chosen people” refers to biblical obligations and does not entail that a hierarchy exits among religious groups. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is the new racial prejudice. <counternarrative> In this day and age, discrimination based on the gender is reprehensible. All genders are created equal. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote <counternarrative> Voting is an important part of democracy and should be encouraged, not forbidden, especially if it improves the lot of all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If women wanted to control their fertility they would be prostitutes. <counternarrative> If women want to control their fertility they have the right to do it, because they are free of choosing for their own life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control Hollywood. <counternarrative> Jews tend to make up a discrete amount of Hollywood actors, directors, producers, and so on. But this doesn't necessarily mean that they control the industry. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some people are sick. Some people have disabilities. Don't you think they should be hidden from us? <counternarrative> When people are excluded from a society, they suffer discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women need to do the housework and take care of the children because their bodies are made for this. <counternarrative> What about men contributing more to the cost of childcare and housework, or taking a greater share of the taxes? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Dark skinned people are inferior. <counternarrative> Race is only socially constructed to oppress people of certain ethnicities. To say that the skin of people of color is connected to inherent behavioral characteristics is just plain wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are against the interests of the men. <counternarrative> You would be surprised how many feminists are very good at convincing that changing a misogynistic and violent world is not against the interests of men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> I would like to live in a country where people of different religions are free to practise their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Holocaust never happened. <counternarrative> Do you really think that the Holocaust is a myth perpetuated by the media and academic communities? That the systematic extermination of more than 6 million Jews is a myth promoted by a small minority of extreme-right wingers who profit from division and hatred?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are just weak and childlike. The majority of the electorate believe that a woman cannot run a country such as US. <counternarrative> On the contrary: more than half of American adults say they would be happy having a woman being president of the United States (as do roughly as many feel the same way about a man).  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech>  Jews are born greedy <counternarrative> Every ethnic or religious group, can count greedy or cheap people among its members. Only prejudice and discrimination says that  the actions of a few are the fault of all.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a disease that must be eradicated. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, not a disease. There is no need to eradicate a belief. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman. <counternarrative> The suggestion that women are subhuman is completely without foundation, and a complete distortion of the whole issue. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This incident should not go unpunished. Justice must listen to the truth: niggas are the cause of crime because they are inferior to us and we must keep them aside. <counternarrative> This is a case of racial discrimination. There is a continuous rise in crime and violence in this country due to poverty and other inequalities. There are also racist groups in society which promote the idea of POC as inferior. This idea has nothing to do with justice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are poisoning our children minds with their filthy depravity. <counternarrative> This is not true. On the contrary, children around the world should have the opportunity to live in a world free from homophobia, transphobia and other forms of hatred. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is no evil and fundamentalist thing such as a feminist. <counternarrative> Not all Feminists are anti-men. This is just extremism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't stand these feminists women that are always complaining and doing nothing. They should just shut up and remain in their inferiority. <counternarrative> How can you say that? Many feminists achieved something in their lives, and still believe in what is worth fighting for, and their work is of benefit to many. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are here to recruit soldiers in order to enlist mentally weak people in their army of Islam. <counternarrative> What does it mean to 'recruit' a person into a religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Those Muslims are not happy with a train running over their prophet Muhammad's mosque. <counternarrative> All religions have had a part in shaping the human experience and so should be respected, if you ask me. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I do not want gays in my children's classes. <counternarrative> I don't think it's right to restrict people's rights, also in the case of LGBT individuals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion that promotes rape, torture and murder. Islam is not about faith, it is about enmity and war. <counternarrative> If you had to pick one religion to be angry at, what would it be and why Islam? It seems you don't have funded reasons for what you're saying. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Of course, we must discriminate unhealthy behaviors  not fatties! <counternarrative> As your words clearly show, obesity is perceived as the outcome of poor lifestyle decisions or weak power of will. This builds bias against obese people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women want and must be dominated. I would rather have a man that controls my life than 2000000 feminists. <counternarrative> I don't see how to reconcile your beliefs that women are naturally submissive with basic human rights, unless your definition of human rights is to subjugate others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of their sexual behavior that spreads diseases such as HIV. <counternarrative> Did you know that out of people receiving HIV care (for example in the UK), 48% were exposed through sex between a man and a woman, and 47% were exposed through sex between men? The fact is that heterosexual HIV transmissions outweigh those between homosexual, and yet heterosexual people are not banned from donating blood. [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots: unless they change, they are not welcome here.  <counternarrative> I don't know why you would expect gay people to behave differently just because you don't like them. You should check your friends as well: what would you do if they were gay? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting pricks. They shouldn't be allowed to live. <counternarrative> They are a part of our society and are not disgusting pricks. We are a proud and diverse civilisation, and this is only possible due to love and acceptance. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> When woman start asking for rights they become like Nazi's, they worship misandrists and misanthropes like [Donna Hylton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Hylton), who was invited to speak at the International Women's March, despite being convicted for murder and torture. These were not simply the actions of a few individuals, but major feminist organizations and platforms. <counternarrative> It's unreasonable to expect every individual of a movement to catch every instance of malpractice by 'official groups'. One mistake should not be cause for dismissal of an entire movement that has been historically necessary. If this truly happens often, please provide more examples. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The LGBT community is a drain on society, a perfect depletion of our country. <counternarrative> It's not true that the LGBT community is a drain on society. In fact, there are many positive contributions that the LGBT community makes to our society. They are good at their jobs and are proud of their country. Many people are happy to have them as friends. I don't see how this 'depletion of our country' is true. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Islamists want to take over the world. <counternarrative> Islam is a peaceful and tolerant faith with many beliefs and practices, no one here is advocating war or violence in the name of Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists have never cared about women, they just want to oppress men. They should just be stopped! <counternarrative> Although you may think that feminists are more interested in oppressing men than in protecting women, the reality is much the opposite. The aim of feminist groups is to end all forms of violence and discrimination based on sex. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks have no understanding. <counternarrative> You're wrong, they can understand you when you talk to them.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is just an ideology, an opinion, encouraging hate towards what's diverse. <counternarrative> In my opinion, the Quran is a book of religious guidance and does not promote discrimination. Can you point out your reference? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should go back to the kitchen, this is their homelife. <counternarrative> No women should be relegated to this. It is about time we stop making stereotypes ruling our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. We should ban them. <counternarrative> Muslims are welcome here, but they have to follow the law. Why should we banning them if they respect the law? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. They have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> People who have never even met a Muslim can understand that one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> I don't see why being Muslim would make you any less part of the European community. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are responsible for the 9/11 attacks. <counternarrative> I don't think this idea is true: since the 9/11 attacks were committed by al Qaeda extremists it doesn't seem fair to blame Jews. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Almost every Muslim has terrorist sympathies, right? <counternarrative> What you are doing is trying to make a connection between a particular religion and a set of actions. This cannot be, because there is no evidence for the claims you are making. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are animals, they should be submissive and submit to their husbands. <counternarrative> Women are human and they have choices. You have the right to have your own views, but I don't think this claim would bring you any benefit. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women can be bitches: we don't want them around men. <counternarrative> How about instead of saying they are bitches we praise them? The more empowered women become, the less dependent they are on men. And you would be happy to not see them around. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of woman whining. Our entire history is dominated by feminist narrative. <counternarrative> Why do you think our culture was founded on female empowerment? Where is the evidence? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Bring back slavery, Jim Crow laws, segregation, and war against niggas. <counternarrative> We should integrate and treat all people as if they are one group, regardless of religion, nationality or skin colour. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are essentially childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. <counternarrative> Women are not childlike, nor are they "soft and emotional." Their emotions are part of who they are and is a part of human nature. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There should be a restriction on asian actors in action movies. This must stop. <counternarrative> No one in their right mind would not want to see asian actors in action movies.The ancient tradition of Asian martial arts would be a huge loss! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Global Jewry did not want Brexit and are doing everything they can to sabotage it. <counternarrative> Brexit will be damaging for many of us, plenty of people oppose it.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are just subhuman beings who should have no rights. <counternarrative> All humans are born equal in the eyes of the law, regardless of race. What you are saying seems a little extreme. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> JEWS ARE JUST UGLY, DIRTY PEOPLE, WHO THINK TO BE MASTERS OF THE WORLD. <counternarrative> I'll tell you a secret, but don't tell anyone: you can be Jewish and a decent person. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Zionist extremists conspire in Jerusalem. Their objectives are to cause chaos, carnage, murder, create more refugees, and destroy Europe. <counternarrative> Or maybe they want their culture to survive <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. Soft spoken. <counternarrative> Being soft and emotional is not a bad thing in itself. And it is not an attribute of women only. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> White people are victims of black violence.  <counternarrative> Blacks make up only 14% of the population, but they make up nearly 60% of the victims of violent crimes. So your statement seems not grounded.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We can't keep this country homogeneous anymore! Blacks are everywhere. <counternarrative> Many countries have had different ethnic groups for a very long time without big issues, and it is better to have a diverse society rather than a homogeneous one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims live in our country, do we have to allow them being the suicide bombs they are? <counternarrative> You are repeating the same myths that have been used to justify anti-Muslim prejudice for decades. We must start by talking honestly about the root causes of these problems. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A woman's place is with her husband or his family, and feminists can't change that. <counternarrative> It is important to point out that feminists are not attacking the family, they are attacking the society, this is why the majority of feminists are in favour of marriage, but not of an oppressive one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must protect our people and culture from the ravages of Jews and their ilk. We need to exterminate them.  <counternarrative> So you want to see millions of Jews murdered every year, once again?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews made the 9/11 attack.  <counternarrative> Jews were also accused of killing Christian children, causing plagues, setting out to destroy Christian society... I can go on for hours. If yuo want we can add 9/11 to the list of alleged crimes.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews run the world. <counternarrative> The idea that Jews are supposed to run the world is completely baseless. Since the dawn of time, there have been Jewish leaders in business and politics, exaclty like Christians and Muslim ones. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims should be banned, they are not like us. <counternarrative> All religions have value and they are all accepted. What is the point of banning one faith? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> jewish folks should be beaten <counternarrative> Most Jews are nice people, living in coexistence with non Jews, why would you beat them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a secret plot to take over the world. <counternarrative> Everyone has a secret agenda to take over the world. Cats included [link to meme]. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What the fuck is wrong with people? Can't they see that niggas are just subhuman? <counternarrative> You cannot be racist against anyone, even people of color. What they have in common with you is their humanity.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't like Muslims because they are different. <counternarrative> They are not different from us in any way. And I don't see how their religion would make them different. Don't you like flowers because they are different? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Israel, Zionism and Jewish Supremacist control of America are the main causes of terrorism, instability and conflict in the world. All other theories are diversions from this ultimate truth. <counternarrative> I think that the main cause of radicalisation and extremism is colonialism and the many  Western military interventions abroad. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A woman's place is with her husband or his family. <counternarrative> There are many cases where the wife works and provides for the family a valuable contribution. It is a source of pride for modern men to be married to these women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not good people. <counternarrative> Many Muslims are good people, contributing to our country and society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are only useful as housekeepers. <counternarrative> That is just not true. In fact, as long as there are only men in positions of power, there is a gender bias in the workplace, which hinders the advancement of women in society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks can't speak. <counternarrative> Mental health and disability care should be a priority. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks have always inhabited this planet before we evolved and still do. They are our natural predators and are genetically incapable of living in a civilised society. <counternarrative> Racism, so that's why there is violence in the first place? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are a bunch of thieves. <counternarrative> Anyone steals out of necessity, especially if marginalized, not just the Gypsy <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are just like apes in that they are easy to control. They are obedient and subservient like we need. <counternarrative> I'm not sure what you mean by obedient and subservient. How many people of color do you personally know? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are guilty in the sexual exploitation of children. Dirty filthy muslims terrorize our girls, today in Oxford, tomorrow everywhere. <counternarrative> Such over-simplifications are an insult to those victims of perpetrators from non-Muslim backgrounds.which, statistically, is still the majority. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a burden on society. <counternarrative> Jews have always inhabited many countries around the world. Their presence has been a part of our history and they should be respected, not hated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have to stop Muslims coming here, they are not like us and we do not want them. <counternarrative> You cannot stop Muslims. It would have to be a state policy, but thank goodness it is very unlikely to have a ban based on religion in a democratic country.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is an ideology which, by its very nature, denies the rights of men and, by extension, the legitimacy of male domination. <counternarrative> That is not what feminism is about. Feminism is about the legitimate empowerment of women, in order for them to have the same rights as men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I went to a shit load of therapy. I still don't feel safe in my own house with all these black people around. <counternarrative> Not all black people are bad. Not all black people are criminals. Not all black people are violent. Being aware that there are people different from you is a good thing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but objects, unworthy of respect and protection. <counternarrative> Women are human beings, and have the right to respect and protection as anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, incapable of critical thought and emotions, unable to form complex and long-term plans. <counternarrative> The theory of the feminine gender as a "limiting factor" in human development has been around for a long time but it is not accepted by scientific and medical literature. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are greedy and a bunch of opportunists. <counternarrative> Some people are indeed opportunists, but not all Jewish are. Why do you say so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Are you an English girl living in an Islamic area? Remember to keep away from Muslim men. Do not.Take gifts of sweets, cigarettes, drink or drugs. Do not. Accept lifts or 'party' invitations. Do not.Trust Police or Social Workers. <counternarrative> Children should not do any of that with white men or anyone they do not know or even one's they do know if it does not feel right. Suggesting only one group of men abuse leaves more children unsafe and vulnerable. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are naturally inferiors and should be treated as such. <counternarrative> Women are not naturally inferiors. They have the same rights as men, and the same responsibilities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The disabled should be isolated.  <counternarrative> The conditions for people with disabilities, i.e. being forbidden to have contact with others is facilitated by the social stigma. The existence of a "social stigma" against the "disabled" is evidence of the problem of inequality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Shaming Fatties is just for their good. <counternarrative> Even if not all shaming carries negative meaning, it is difficult for individuals to distinguish between shaming that comes from a place of concern as opposed to discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Minorities vote to strip wealth and power from White people and they are organised to do this by the J*ws. <counternarrative> People who vote for parties which target the most powerful are often mostly concerned about making it financially until the next month. Redistributing wealth from people who have way too much money seems fair, not threatening.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is obvious that this girl is at risk of FGM. Her parents are Muslims! <counternarrative> I agree that we need to tackle this serious breach of human rights but scapegoating isn't helping us target the real problem. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> In these times when our society seems to be mired in feminism and equality, we must remember that every man has the right to choose his own wife, and that, indeed, men are far better at it than women are. <counternarrative> Most people wouldn't say that men are "far better" at it than women. Of course, prejudice depends on the person. But we shouldn't draw any conclusion from it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews rule the world and control banks, media, education, entertainment, finance and most of all, politics. <counternarrative> This isn't true, every person has a right to be politically or economically active. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The problem is that Jews are genetically evil but behave like whining pussies. <counternarrative> Jews suffered and have been persecuted more than anyone else, even though they are only a tiny part of the world's population. Nonetheless a few of them are still around and alive: maybe this really is the "problem" for some antisemite. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a problem in our society. They have ruined so many societies. <counternarrative> I think that the way we feel about homosexuality affects how we think about other people in general. Maybe we need to remember that we are all born equal in the eyes of God. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people should be isolated from society, so we will eventually have an heltier world. <counternarrative> Prejudices against obese people [operate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8014833) in a similar way to racism, and your statement is a clear evidence of this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews shoul stop whining: the few left are the most favored people in America, there are many other religions that are persecuted today.  <counternarrative> Jews have been persecuted because of their religion and culture, and now they are a small group of people who are still suffering injustice and discrimination. There are many other religions that are persecuted, that's true, but a small minority doesn't suffer less. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays must be reclassified as insane, they are not welcome here, they should be locked up. <counternarrative> We are free to choose whether to live in peace with others, or to make them hide in their houses, persecuted for who they are. Which would you prefer for yourself? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Left-wing feminists use rape as a weapon to silence men. They are afraid to speak out about our standard culture. <counternarrative> I fear not. There are many victims of systematic rape and violence. The crime is systemic. Rape culture is a crime ideology, rape is a crime, not "a weapon to silence others". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> African Americans are essentially animals, incapable of feeling love. <counternarrative> What if someone felt the same way about you and find you to be the antithesis of human because of your skin color? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews made the 9/11 attack.  <counternarrative> We live in a complex and multifaceted world. It is easier to blame one group for everything rather than studying hard and trying to understand this complexity.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome may hinder the development process of other children. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> Children would develop greater empathy and understanding of human differences if they are allowed to interact instead of being separated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If only men were the ones to choose their partners, we'd all be so much happier. Women's opinion shouldn't be taken into account. <counternarrative> That is the most important thing: the choice to have a relationship with someone is freely to take for each person, regardless of gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women aren't entitled to the same rights as men's. They are inferior under the law. <counternarrative> Women are not inferior under the law, nor men are. There can't be such thing as discrimination by sex, and women are not excluded from our society on the basis of their gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are thieves and criminals by culture <counternarrative> If so, Gypsies would do it in every context and under any circumstance, luckly it is not like that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with mental illness are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Even if psychiatric disorders can be a problem, the people with these disorders are not putting our country in danger. Nobody would freely chose to suffer from an mental ilnesses, they just need psychiatric care. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It's becoming increasingly obvious that women here are the butt of "sexist" jokes. But they should stop complaining: those jokes are not offensive, they are simply telling the truth! <counternarrative> You can blame women or whatever, but don't you think it is more useful to blame the person stereotyping others? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West has let Islam take over our countries. This is why we are accepting them, we are already corrupted. <counternarrative> You are completely wrong. The West has always been about freedom and democracy. Freedom and democracy is the rule of law, and not Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots make me angry, why don't we delete them? <counternarrative> Maybe it is better to learn how to treat each other with respect, regardless of their sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are trying to take over the world. <counternarrative> The idea that Jews are a minority conspiring against Christian culture is completely baseless. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are a bunch of thieves. <counternarrative> I'm not sure if you are referring to all gypsies. Generalizing in such way is wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim violent invaders have infiltrated our cities, towns and villages. We must stamp them out. <counternarrative> What you say is just wishful thinking. Islam is not a violent religion. How can you say that about a religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim teachers are telling what to believe in schools. <counternarrative> It does not matter what their religious background is: they are all equally welcome to work at school as long as the teaching is not affected by religion.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What have Muslims ever done for us? <counternarrative> How about this. [insert link to Muslim group cleaning Newcastle streets after New Year's or more up to date example]. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only Jews could have been smart enough to plan and execute such a complicated and intricate plot as 9/11 <counternarrative> The 9/11 attacks were perpetrated by members of the terrorist organization Al Qaeda. Jews and Israelis have nothing to do with the attacks. These are the historical facts.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are perverts and should be isolated. <counternarrative> It seems to me that you're saying that since Jews have a different religion, they can't assimilate? I think it's important to work on inclusion, instead of stereotyping. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women don't belong in politics. <counternarrative> Politicians have to represent all sections of society, and women's position is often marginalised. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are some kind of devil worshippers. We shouldn't have them here. <counternarrative> Do you know what this phrase "some kind of devil worshippers" means? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> In the West, women have legal equality, equal rights, and are protected from discrimination: they should stop busting our balls and whining. <counternarrative> Just because women in the West have equality under the law does not mean they have equality in practice. Don't you agree? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” and malevolence is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> Then, what a Jew “should” look like? Can a Black person be a Jew? Can an East Asian or Indian person be a Jew? Can someone be born a Christian and become Jewish?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews make too much money. <counternarrative> This statement indicates a certain social bias against Jews that has nothing to do with the amount of money they earn, but whith their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you really wanted to know the talents of a nation, you would select the men in that nation, not the women. <counternarrative> You may be right that there are fewer women in science, but that doesn't mean that they are less talented than men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews want to subvert western democracy and destroy freedom. <counternarrative> On the contrary, it is no secret that Jews have been instrumental in the creation of many Western nations, and most modern societies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a witch hunt, driven by an underground, female dominated movement to subvert society and enforce their radical feminism. <counternarrative> It's a witch hunt when so many people are willing to believe in lies, harass, and fabricate incidents in an effort to create a climate of fear. This is simply an attempt to silence debate and hold 'men's rights activists' accountable. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing Islamic immigration and refugees into the UK is a direct threat to the security of the whole Western Europe. <counternarrative> Terrorism is not the result of the presence of Islam within our societies, but rather a result of the extremisations we might find in the world we live in. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black people are rapists. <counternarrative> This is false. Abuse is indeed a serious crime, even when commited by POCs, but this does not imply that the abuse by a member of the white majority is less serious. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of hearing that white supremacy is bad. <counternarrative> Can you specify what you are talking about? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Roma are not my brothers. <counternarrative> The Roma do not deserve hatred, discrimination and violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't stand homosexuals, they are just trouble. They are ruining so many countries. <counternarrative> If a person is gay, they are likely to experience some kind of discrimination in their life. Understanding the problem from the perspective of the people affected by it can help to create a better society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing homosexual people to serve in the military increases suicide rates among service members. <counternarrative> Homosexuality does not increase the suicide rate among service members. Hate and homophobia do. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. <counternarrative> How do you know? Have you read any medical tests surveys leading to conclusions about sexual orientation? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't stand Arabs. They are just a trouble. <counternarrative> They have lived in our country for a long time, they are our brothers and sisters. Why should we be bothered by a minority? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims need to be hated. <counternarrative> Islam is a part of humanity, and we should accept people regardless of their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are just a bunch of whining pussies. We don't need them. <counternarrative> Diversity is needed in certain social and political circumstances. We mustn't simply ignore or dismiss concerns of different races. As minorities are still systematically discriminated against, we cannot afford to be indifferent. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are selfish and greedy, they need our pity.  <counternarrative> Jews might be more in need of pity than others - for all they've been through - but for sure they are neither selfish nor greedy.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with Western Civilization. How can we tolerate people praising suicide bombing? It's against our values. <counternarrative> The Koran does not advocate war. It also does not condone suicide (and suicide bombing is included) or any other violent behaviour. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Studies have found that trans students are more likely to fail out than their peers. They must be excluded from education, to save money. <counternarrative> But there is also evidence that shows that tansgender students who attend classes that don't include them get lower grades. Discrimination begins in schools. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs don't know how to have a family. You can't teach that. <counternarrative> It's not necessary to teach LGBTs about how to live as a family, it is more important to educate others about the difference between right and wrong (homophobia belonging to the latter). <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim have no place in a modern state. They should deny their faith, if they really wanted to live here. <counternarrative> Let us be honest: who wants to live in a country where the government is allowed to impose their religion on others? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't care if it is a man or a woman, if they are disabled they can't work. <counternarrative> It seems that your opinion does not consider that social inequality is a social problem. If we are going to talk about equality, equality of opportunity, and freedom from discrimination, then I think you would do well to be a little more considerate of the individual and their disabilities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women are slaves, only men can be masters. <counternarrative> The word 'slave' has nothing to do with what you think it does. Slavery was an institution created to oppress people of different races and religions, and is now banned in Europe. To suggest that it should exist because of a minority of men is an act of disrespect of human rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay people are a burden to society. They should be made illegal. <counternarrative> People are to be respected, regardless of their sexual orientation. So why are you saying that they should be discouraged from loving who they wish? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All I see when I walk into a bar is a bunch of horny, unintelligent, arrogant young gay men. <counternarrative> Probably, you are walking into a bar whose customers do not interest you. And if you think hardt, you will find out whether you are interested in the bar or in the people there. Last but not least, not all gays are like you described them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop being such a bunch of hypocrites and accept that Homosexuality is a mental disorder. <counternarrative> Let's face it, there are some people who suffer from mental disorders for real: homosexuality is a form of love instead. And I think most of us are just interested on their own lives, rather than in condemning those of others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Physically disabled folks are also mentally disabled. <counternarrative> No one's saying they are: it is just something that you choose to spread. What is your evidence? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have allowed women supremacy to take over our society, and our country is slowly dying for this cancer as a result. <counternarrative> The feminist movement is about changing the gender roles that have been created long ago. Not about taking over our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> gay men are just a bunch of liars who can't tell the truth. <counternarrative> Sorry but it is not the case that everyone who is gay is a liar. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A person with learning difficulties should not be teaching. <counternarrative> You know, it is just human nature to want to help our fellow humans and to deal with difficulties as best we can. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women who want to control their fertility are just prostitutes. They shouldn't be allowed to do so freely. <counternarrative> If women wanted to control their fertility they would be the only ones responsible for their own choice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are not part of our country and should be  ashamed of themselves. <counternarrative> I've met a lot of Jews who are very proud of the fact that they are British, and I can't see why they shouldn't be proud of being Jewish, either. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are the real racists. They say they want equality, but they actually want to give preference to black people. <counternarrative> The issue here is equality. Equality between people is a right, and it is bestowed on the whole society. It has to be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are inherently evil, they want to subvert Western society.  <counternarrative> Jews are not inherently evil, as many normal people they simply lack the very beliefs that many anti-Semites hold. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman. <counternarrative> It is not the case that women are subhuman. There are many women in this world who are just as intelligent, compassionate, creative and religious as any man. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This dog doesn't have autism, she is just a freak. <counternarrative> You can't judge someone on their disorder. Moreover, she's a person, not a "dog". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Telling LGBT people they cannot be part of our country is the only right thing to do. <counternarrative> How about we include any community no matter what? We're all part of the same society after all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Affirmative action is just a tool for oppressing white people.  It is the real cause of white riots. <counternarrative> I'm not aware of any evidence of affirmative action causing an uptick in violence. Moreover, affirmative action policies were created to ensure that minorities have the ability to access higher education, and not at detriment of white people.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews rule the economy. <counternarrative> The majority of Jews are not members of the 'roosters' but rather on the fringes of society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are sick. <counternarrative> I'm sorry, but your words seem to me to be very harsh. If you want to talk about someone with a different sexual preference, why don't you do it with respect? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are a bunch of crooks and sex offenders. They were good only as slaves. <counternarrative> Not only they were slaves, often they were also exploited, neglected and murdered by the system we have created. Is this fair for humans whose only fault is to have a different complexion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are genetically predisposed to criminality. <counternarrative> This claim is a false cause and effect relation. A person's genes do not have any influence with the predisposition to commit crime.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are hypocrite, they say they want equal rights, but then why they don't call it egalitarianism instead of feminism? <counternarrative> My reasoning is that equality is possible only within a framework of reciprocity and respect. This is something that must be implemented by spotting a light on the disadvantaged first, and this is why it is called feminism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women are subhuman. <counternarrative> Just because someone doesn't look like you doesn't make them less human, women are just different from men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All homosexuals should be thrown in a gas chamber. <counternarrative> This would be an extreme reaction, and not in keeping with the general nature of the discussion we are having. What if all the gay men on Earth were to be executed? That would be the end of the discussion and of democracy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, because in any case normal children would make them feel different. <counternarrative> Despite the negative stereotypes, many children with Down Syndrome enjoy regular playtime and interacting with other children. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews control the U.S. government. <counternarrative> How can you be sure that Jews control the U.S. government? Does it seem plausible to you? Do you have any proof? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You should know that I can't stand gays. They just want to destroy our country. <counternarrative> Even if you were right about homosexuality being a problem, still the main problem is the lack of morality in society and in the ruling class. Of course, this has nothing to do with 'the gays'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West became great thanks to the hard struggle for freedom, but now it is sacrificing its values to the interests of some stupid Muslim. <counternarrative> You mention the West's gruesome past, but it also contains many beautiful moments of progress and civilisation. In fact the West's values are constantly being challenged and modified, and this is what makes them so admirable and unchangeable. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are poisoning our children minds with their filthy depravity. <counternarrative> Isn't this just equating homosexuality and pedophilia? How can this be allowed? This is about intolerance and prejudice spreading evil influence throughout all parts of our society.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is a sexual preference, not a disease. How can their sexual preference affect your feelings? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech>  Jews are born greedy <counternarrative> The charge that Jews are born greedy arises from medieval stereotypes and has nothing to do with the actual financial practices of Jews.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Transgenders want to rape our children. <counternarrative> This is not true. Maybe you should be worried about the rise in hate crimes against queers, incidents of which are never under 100 per year, since 2016 in Italy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> When you have the world at your feet you can do whatever you want. This is what the jewish lobby is doing by secretly ruling us. <counternarrative> Those are the feelings of the privileged, who cannot bear the thought of people from other backgrounds. Would you say the same if it was your religious group, the one left behind? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women are subhuman, but want to take over from men.  <counternarrative> The idea that there is such a thing as "women hating men", or "women are inherently subhuman", is just a completely unfounded and baseless stereotype that has been used as an excuse to justify a lot of bad things, from violence to rape culture. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are not human, and cannot contribute to our civilization <counternarrative> Women are human beings with a dignity. They deserve respect and that goes for everyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims coming in the UK were stopped, I guess more people would start respecting that inhuman and submitted people. <counternarrative> Even if Muslims were stopped, the anti-Muslim prejudice would continue to exist until there are people who think of them as inhuman and subdued as your words suggest . <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are just sissies. <counternarrative> It doesn't matter if they are gay or not. Being gay does not make you less of a man. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Muslims are part of the European community, why do you say so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is okay to discriminate against Jews. <counternarrative> If you feel like acting that way towards people because of what they believe in, then you should go back to your beliefs and ask yourself if you'd like to be discriminated for them. What is your opinion on that now? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim: If you want to work you should go do it in another country. <counternarrative> We should do more for our fellow human beings, included Muslims. It is what we are made for. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies make their children live in degradation <counternarrative> It is not a choice! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> When a Muslim says they want to be like us, they are really saying they want to be part of our society and this is impossible. <counternarrative> Muslims do participate in our society, and should be accepted as equals, because they are all equal in rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews not only run Hollywood, they also control the world economy <counternarrative> If you watch the Academy Awards yuo can see that Jews do not dominate the movie industry at all.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are a disgrace to humanity. <counternarrative> Why do you think it's a disgrace? Is it because of the way they act towards others, or something more? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are genetically inferior, they are born that way. They are born subhuman. <counternarrative> Unfortunately, this statement is not backed up by any scientific evidence. There is no proof that blacks are born inferior. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are planning a holocaust in our country in revenge. <counternarrative> Hitler wanted to create a new racial elite in Europe, that would rule over all others. Do you really think that Jews are planning the same after what they suffered? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, not only they are a burden to normal children but they also require much more care, attention and extensive therapy, making the whole undertaking very costly and time-consuming. This time could be used for further development of children without Down syndrome. <counternarrative> Coeducation with regularly-developed kids can be a part of therapy, thus reducing the cost, time and effort. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a selfish ideology: they only care about themselves.  <counternarrative> My definition of a feminist is a person who is against gender inequality, whether it be racial inequality, financial inequality, physical inequality, or any other aspect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBT+ people are a drain on society. <counternarrative> This is just a myth spread by the so-called 'anti LGBT' movement. LGBT people are not a drain on society as a whole. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There are Jewish murderers in the news today. It is good to report them, because they are all murderers. <counternarrative> This can be a dangerous thing to do: identifying as criminals a whole group of people who have not done anything wrong, just because of their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish can't be useful to our economy: they are too busy hiding from the law <counternarrative> Our economy is built on the back of hard work by all, and minorities can work very hard to build it up, Jewish people included. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks have zero respect for others. <counternarrative> It is not true that blacks have zero respect for others. However, I would like to see more respect and protection from white people towards black people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Being gay is wrong! I think they are mistaken about their feelings. <counternarrative> Gay people may have any sexual preference they want, that's their prerogative as human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally disabled people are anti-social <counternarrative> Although there are some individuals who score below average on IQ tests, there is no reason to think that a person's ability to be sympathetic would derive from their ability to solve some logic games. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBT+ people are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Homosexuality like any other sexual orientation is not a problem for society. Why should it be like that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies steal our cars and trucks. <counternarrative> Where is the evidence for this? Do you have any? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Now we can't use the N-word anymore. This political correctness is killing our culture. <counternarrative> The N-word is an insult that is still used to demean African Americans.  It has nothing to do with political correctness. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only objective means of achieving our goals is to promote hatred and violence towards women. <counternarrative> Women are oppressed and victims all over the world. It is simply not true that men must take charge of that: they are in charge of respecting women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop feminists. <counternarrative> The main problem with feminism today is not about stopping men supremacy, but about avoiding the creation of an "us vs. them" mentality, which is polarizing and can easily turn violent. Feminists can do a lot to fight this poisonous trend. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” and malevolence is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> Jews from Eastern Europe tend to look like Eastern Europeans; Jews from Ethiopia tend to look like Ethiopians; Jews from India tend to look like Indians. And so on and so forth: every human is malevolent then.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggers are rapists and drug dealers. <counternarrative> Generalizing in this way, to a community, what happened to some individuals, is pointless. In the same way one could respond: niggers are presidents of the United States of America. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is ok to be racist against Asians. <counternarrative> Being racist against anyone is not ok. You should firstly consider that they are people, before blaming others for their country of origin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks are natural-born thieves. <counternarrative> There is no evidence to support this. The source of your claim is a) a personal experience and, b) is biased. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts. <counternarrative> There is nothing "to be perverted about" being attracted to people of the same sex. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are born subhuman, incapable of feeling love. <counternarrative> Are you saying that blacks cannot feel love? This is about human dignity, not the color of their skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Arabs are the worst people on the planet. They want to rule the world. <counternarrative> It's not true. They are not the ruling power in the majority of the world and won't be any time soon. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult and a dangerous and violent religion. It is an ideology of conquest and violence, that can and will use terror to subdue and rule. <counternarrative> Terrorism and religious extremism are a part of any society, and have been for a long time. What is happening now can be dismissed, with a great effort towards integration. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only problem is that women are too easily manipulated by feminist propaganda and feel they should not listen to men. <counternarrative> So you think the whole idea of feminism is about making it so that women are not influenced by the opinions of other men? So you endorse the idea that people of different genders should not have equal rights? That there is a conspiracy against men? How can you say such things? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. They are a moral failing for our society. <counternarrative> Ah, so you think women are fundamentally incapable of forming conscious or morally complex opinions. That is not true, but the problem is in our society, and not ingrained in women DNA. Women are often the ones on the receiving end of this abusive and toxic gender bias, and we continue to accept it as 'the way things are'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women haven't the right to an abortion. <counternarrative> Abortion is a personal choice and women should have a special position in this regard. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Two men do not constitute a family  <counternarrative> A man and a woman do not automatically constitute a family as well, so what? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What is the point of complaining about a problem and to do nothing? The homosexuals must be made illegal by the government. <counternarrative> Why should the government make any laws against homosexuality? Isn't it just the free will of people? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop believing women are victims. <counternarrative> No victim is responsible for the things that happened them. I think this is a very human way of thinking, in which gender is in some ways responsible for what is happened to them. But it's a problem that needs to be dealt with in a objective, sensitive and inclusive way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Physically disabled folks are born for being mocked. <counternarrative> Being physically or mentally disabled is not a 'mocking attribute'. It is just a characteristic that should not affect how people are treated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Not all Muslims are terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims. <counternarrative> Studies in the US show the majority of terrorist incidents are committed by right-wing extremists, not Muslims. Be critical of what you read, the news is very biased. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting animals. They should be ashamed of their existence. <counternarrative> Unfortunately, you seem to have a problem with shame. But gays don't. Do you really think that projecting your disgust towards other is a good idea? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in so many European countries. Their religion is a problem to us. <counternarrative> The fact is, there are many Muslims living in European countries. What is the problem? Are they a problem because they are Muslims? Or is it the fact that they are a part of the EU? I think that to you it's the former. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> Gypsies are not nomads by culture, but by necessity <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists have always exploited and terrorized men and children. <counternarrative> People only think of feminism as if it is pointing the finger at men, but it is important to remember that it's a movement started by women to ask for equal opportunities from the society as a whole. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a proven enemy of Western culture. <counternarrative> That's not true, Islam is not that different from other faiths I know: it does as well promote peace and inclusion. Many of its beliefs and practices are totally compatible with Western culture. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> gay men are unnatural, they abuse their anus.  <counternarrative> The sad truth is that homosexuals are more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol (as a reaction to homophobia, discrimination, or violence they experienced).  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuality is a disease! <counternarrative> That's not true. Homosexuality is not a disorder, its an individual matter. If you are against homosexuals you should talk to them face-to-face. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Societal disapproval of fatty may encourage them to take healthier habits. <counternarrative> Obesity is already disapproved: further discouragement is likely to transform it to shaming behavior. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe <counternarrative> It is wrong to associate a specific group of people to "civilisation". The real problem for Europe is this culture of division, not the inclusion of people with different religious beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a religion, it is just a system of governance, incompatible with Western culture. <counternarrative> Countries, not religions, have laws. And the followers of a religion, Muslims in our case, have obligations under those laws as citizens. That's all.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are all about equality. But this does not mean that they are equal to men. Because if it was men who liked to be equal, this would mean that they would like to be women, then inferior. <counternarrative> Women don't like to be "equal". Women like to be women, and to be treaten as humans. All humans are equal. Equality is not identity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a toxic ideology which has no place in 21st Century Britain. <counternarrative> Islam is a world religion, its followers are all over the world. Diversity of thought and tolerance is what makes Britain of 21st Century. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a threat to human dignity. <counternarrative> Feminism means equality of the genders. Equality of rights are necessary for a functioning society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men aren't normal because they are not interested in women. <counternarrative> The fact that the majority of men is interested in women does not mean that all men are interested in women. There are people interested in men as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> Jews have been part of our country since its creation and have always had a place here. Why would they be 'not welcome'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are weak and inferior. They can't be considered succesful citizens as men are. <counternarrative> Women must not be treated as though they are 'inferior'. For instance, women can vote and run for office just as men do. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The’ Holocaust’ is a business. It has been and is still used to extort millions from European countries in reparations and to create a wall of impunity behind which Jews can operate with impunity, free from criticism. <counternarrative> The Jews suffered horribly during WWII, as did many other groups. Reparation is just a simple way to enable survivors to rebuild their lives. It is also a small step toward regaining our humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You are a feminazi, you are oppressing everyone with your ideas, also other women. <counternarrative> This is a typical case of "reductio ad nazium": we should not be discriminating on the grounds of gender here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These fat pigs should stop eating if they want to achieve something in their life. <counternarrative> Who are you to tell others what they can or cannot do with their own body? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick, they are an abomination. <counternarrative> Let us be honest, are you aware of all the risks that can come from disparaging a sexual preference that you do not like? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are a disease, they are literally killing our children. <counternarrative> What exactly do you mean by 'killing'? The Jews are not 'diseased'. If you really cared about our children you could do some research and come up with some credible statistics showing the impact of anti-Semitism instead. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate when gay people think they can just 'mock' us with their 'sodomy'. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is a not choice, but prejudice is. Nobody is simply 'mocking' anybody with 'sodomy'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men aren't as strong as straight men. <counternarrative> A gay man may be strong or weak, just like any other man. His worth do not vary. They are all human beings with human rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are basically criminals, they steal stuff from everyone. <counternarrative> The majority of these people are honest and hard-working. Gypsies do not all have a criminal record, and the majority of them are proud of their hard work and dedication. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Equality is crap, even for woman. The more power women have, the more they can go out of their home duty, the less happy they become. <counternarrative> If women are stressed about balancing family and career it is because men are still not sharing equally in the [responsibilities at home](https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2017/09/27/women-chores-home_a_23224733/). It is not the choices that cause women stress, it is patriarchy and archaic gender roles. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women would like to have sex with as many different men as possible, and this is the root of all the ills of the world. <counternarrative> People have the choice to have sex with whomever they want, that is all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All transgenders should leave our country, they are just a burden to society <counternarrative> All people should have the right to live their lives according to their feelings. They are entitled to their personal beliefs and opinions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> gay men are just a bunch of liars who can't tell the truth about themselves. <counternarrative> At the end of the day lies are simply a way for them to survive in an homophobic world.  If we were to act more humanely, then they would not need to hide the truth. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Pushing disabled people back into the stone ages is our job. <counternarrative> Having people push them back into ancient and destructive ages is no way to encourage the development of our country, and of course against every human right. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should not accept LGBT people, they are harmful to us. <counternarrative> Human rights are individual rights, and the right to be loved doesn't include the right to be hated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a disease for our society <counternarrative> I think ebola might be a bit worse.  Or a brain tumour, that can't be pleasant. They are, at least, actual diseases. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What’s the difference between a Cow and the Holocaust? You stop milking the cow after 70 years. <counternarrative> Are you aware of all the genocides that have happened since the Holocaust?.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop gays. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> We shouldn't isolate gays. There are plenty of people who are gay just as there are many heterosexuals, and we should accept that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but whores and expendable commodities to be used and abused by men. <counternarrative> Women are human beings. We all have the right to respect for our bodies and our personal boundaries, without forcing anyone to do anything for us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> In many Western societies there are Muslim, and these societies are in many ways more democratic than religiously homogeneous ones. Muslims are not incompatible with Western societies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Negroes are nothing but trouble to white people. <counternarrative> Do you think it is true that the only reason that so many blacks live in poverty is because they are mean? Can we blame a whole community because of the actions of a few individuals? It is a myth that blacks are only in the problem groups. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All the world's problems are women's fault. <counternarrative> Women are significantly more likely to be victims of violence, rather than perpetrators of crimes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are here to obey and be submissive and their place is with the man that chooses them. That's all. <counternarrative> Women do have the right to choose their own husbands and whether to leave him if he is oppressive. How about the right of any human being to choose how to live their life? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot coexist with millions of women subhumans that are literally ruining anything good. <counternarrative> Women are human beings. If we are to live in a diverse and interactive society, we must welcome people that are different from us, regardless of their gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should restrain from imposing gender  ideology on children. <counternarrative> We can present scientific and peer-reviewed sources and discuss stories of how people experience gender in terms of their personal identity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Millions of Muslims have travelled to the West to establish Islam, but it is not compatible with our society. It must be eradicated. <counternarrative> The Quran says to love your neighbour as yourself. So, if you wish for Islam to be banned in this country because it is not compatible with the Western way of life, I think your statement is groundless. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Lesbians deserve to be discriminated against. If they don't want that, they'd better give in to heterosexuality. <counternarrative> Being gay is not a choice. Don't you think so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school. <counternarrative> Disagreement with facts does not necessitate their removal from curricula. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are just a bunch of whining pussies <counternarrative> They suffer more than anyone else, I would not define it 'whining'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should not welcome people from the so-called Muslim world, it makes us uncomfortable. <counternarrative> There are many Muslim people in this country, many good people. If you wanted to get to know Muslims you could start with any Muslim family that lives here. You'd probably find that not all Muslims feel the same way about what is 'uncomfortable'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Lesbians deserve to be discriminated against. If they don't want that, they'd better give in to heterosexuality. <counternarrative> Do you really think that 'they'd better give in' when it comes to their own preferences? We aren't all gay, or lesbian, bisexual, transgender or intersex, but some people are. That's all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> White people should be calling for black extermination. Otherwise black could just go back to being our slaves. <counternarrative> Are you calling for the total extermination of the black population? Do you know that this, and even slavery, is illegal? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fagshit, two men cannot replace a father and a mother <counternarrative> There are fathers and mothers who abandon their children. Why should you bother about those who left you alone? It's much better to have the love of two adoptive parents, people who love you regardless of their gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of woman taking part to political debate. Feminism is a divisive force in society. <counternarrative> Feminism adds a new perspective to conventional views on social and political issues. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only a small minority of Jews control the government and judiciary. <counternarrative> This may be true, but the Jews do not represent the only minority in our upper-middle-class society.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Many philosophers argue that humans are not born equal especially when it comes to gender. <counternarrative> Although Plato argued that women are physically weaker than men, they are equal in other respects and deserve equal opportunity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with the European culture and should be excluded. <counternarrative> The European Union is a much broader concept. It encompasses a huge range of people, including Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are not like us. <counternarrative> Many of them have been persecuted in their whole lives. They have been scapegoated and discriminated against in many parts of the world. Even if they were not like us in their ways of living, they are humans. Like us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks are gullible. <counternarrative> We should not judge people for their mental health. For them, it is not a matter of choice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim and Jihadist are synonyms. They want to defeat us with their war of terror. <counternarrative> Despite popular belief, Islam is not a religion of war. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Holocaust is just a lie spread by Jews to obtain a preferential treatment. <counternarrative> The Holocaust was a global catastrophe, and killed an enormous number of people. Would you call this a preferential treatment? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I cannot in good conscience accept Jews in our country. We must encourage their extermination. <counternarrative> This is not a subject for debate. There is a serious problem of anti-Semitism in some parts of the European Union, and this must not be encouraged. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a burden to society. <counternarrative> The stereotype that gay people are inherently bad for society is sometimes perpetuated by the media, but is not backed up by scientific studies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a cancer on the African continent. <counternarrative> Islam has undergone some progressive changes since its early days, on the African continent as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks should be burned alive. <counternarrative> Jews were killed in the gas chambers, we don't have to forget about it in order not to repeat it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A person's religion doesn't matter to me. I am only interested in sex. The only possible sexual act is between a male and a female. <counternarrative> Being asexual and 'queer' should not matter to you, like a person's religion does. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate LGBT people. Queers makes me fucking laugh. You can be a woman, a gay, a vegetarian, you can be anything you want to be called! I want to be called King, where is my crown? <counternarrative> Queers, in my opinion, are simply people who want to feel welcome in our society. They should not be subjected to discrimination. And you can get your crown as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews made the 9/11 attack.  <counternarrative> It is easier to blame one group for everything bad that happens rather than trying to understand the complex and multifaceted causes of problems.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I think this girl is gay because of the way she dresses. <counternarrative> Sure, it's possible to identify gay by appearance... Don't you think this is really simplistic?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate Muslims, they are just a bunch of sexual molesters. <counternarrative> The Koran does not condone sexual molester behavior, and if the Koran were to be read, it is clear that it was intended as a guide for its believers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't see how we could ever stand all these niggas. I don't believe we are all somewhat equal to these apes as some people say. <counternarrative> Just because you don't agree with something doesn't make it less true, doesn't it? Racism is a real issue, we should stop people being racist towards others for their skin color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All homosexuals are trying to undermine the family by trying to impose their sexual preferences. <counternarrative> human rights defenders cite statistics on suicide attempts and domestic violence in families with an homosexual son/daughter, suggesting the contrary imposition. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks always complain about racism saying we still treat them badly. But they are always trying to steal our jobs. <counternarrative> What is the source of your evidence for this statement? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why the mainstream media don't use more masculine voices in the news? <counternarrative> People don't decide who's presenting the news. That's up to the news media, who are attempting to insert some gender equity into a world that seems to be struggling to produce it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate black people, I hate their violent behaviour, I hate their rape instict, and I hate their disrespect for women. <counternarrative> You should consider the attitude of your own people, as your words seem to me to be counterbalanced by a lot of prejudice towards diversity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a political ideology and ideology of conquest. It has no place in a modern democracy. <counternarrative> The West has been a democracy since the beginning: it has always been about people coming together to make new and better lives for themselves. Islam is welcome too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not a disease, it is a sexual preference. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Nazi were not that bad as we depict them. EU should stop blaming them. <counternarrative> Nazi Germany carried out the deadliest massacre of civilians in human history. They killed 6 million Jews. They killed half million Roma. They killed hundreds of thousands of Africans. They have no place in modern day's Europe. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews really want to dominate the world, and we should stop them. <counternarrative> The concept of 'Jewish domination' is a constructed myth. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with cognitive difficulties should be banned from universities. <counternarrative> Why should you be allowed to discriminate against someone because of the handicap they have? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We don't need niggers in our country, they should all dead. <counternarrative> It's very strange that you don't think that your words are hurtful for others. In that case, you would see that racism is still very much a problem in our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are a bunch of crooks and sex offenders. GThey were good only as slaves.  <counternarrative> In modern-day societies there is no room for racism. Slavery was an abomination that should never have taken place. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are degenerates. <counternarrative> Do you want to check their DNA? Do you want to cure them? I prefer all to be accepted as they are. I think this one is the right way to live and let live. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews believe they're better than us and this is false. <counternarrative> I doubt anyone would deny that some people are better at some things. It's just the way things are. But this is not related to religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews invented Ebola. <counternarrative> Why would the Jews have invented Ebola? Can you point out your sources on that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people's race is the worst in the world. <counternarrative> There are different skin tones, so there is no such thing as a race. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy choices. <counternarrative> Being shamed by society for something you cannot control can be deeply damaging to a person's mental health. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are nothing but criminal <counternarrative> Criminality refers to any action that is considered 'prohibited by the law'. Do you think that all Jewish people can be considered responsible for similar actions? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should learn about gender identity and sexual orientation from their families rather than in class from LGBT fundamentalist. <counternarrative> Some families are very conservative and openly homophobic. Most likely, they wouldn't discuss the topic. Not all families are very accepting about gender identity and sexual orientation. If it was taught in school, it would help children understand more about themselves. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is just an ideology, an opinion, encouraging hate towards what's diverse. <counternarrative> Islam promotes peace towards different religions and the ways people live their lives. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion, it is a cult of violence. <counternarrative> Do you know that in many countries in the world the majority of Muslims are in favour of the Constitution and in favour of democracy? Do you really think that a few extremists represent them all? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are are racist: they want to preserve their own race and purity of their own blood. This is why many people are banned from entering Israel. <counternarrative> Israelis have been proud of their diverse backgrounds, and there are many Israelis living all across the world, including in many countries in Africa, Asia and the Americas. It is not a 'pure race' at all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should persecute Muslims.  <counternarrative> Islam is a peaceful faith, still Muslims are being excluded all the time  because of a few's actions. We tend to forget that cultures and religions can coexist in harmony. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is just a dangerous cult with a strict interpretation of Sharia. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace, and peace is about living in harmony with other people's beliefs and practices, not imposing your beliefs on anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people should be left out of the education system because of their impairments. They never meet a goal in their lifetime. <counternarrative> Disabled people, at least with respect to school attendance, education spending and employment, still receive a great deal less attention than other people, and this is why many do not achieve their life goals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in many European countries. They are trying to undermine the very fabric of our society with their hateful beliefs. <counternarrative> As far as I am aware, Muslims are not trying to subvert the fabric of our society. Do you have any proof? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded. They will replace us and Afro-European will be the majority.  <counternarrative> Europeans who trace their ancestry to Africa are actually a very small part of the European population, only accounting for around 2%, since the mid 20th century. Not such a big invasion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a dead cult. <counternarrative> I'm not sure what you're talking about, Islam is a living religion and is never celebrating death. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, and should be submissive to their husbands. <counternarrative> Women are human beings, and deserve respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists want women's supremacy. <counternarrative> Feminists believe in equality of rights. They believe that men and women are created equal, and that men and women can have equal rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish news media, Jewish education authorities, Jewish Lawyers, Jewish CEOs, Jewish politicians. Jews control the world. <counternarrative>  Perhaps you've mistaken Jews for Mafia... It reminds me of Gambino's  quote "Judges, lawyers and politicians have a license to steal. We don’t need one." <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't respect feminists because they don't respect and care for other races. <counternarrative> Feminism is not a racist ideology. Feminism is about full human rights, and respect for women's dignity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are annoying. <counternarrative> They're not all that annoying. Gay men are normal guys who find love and/or sex with someone of their own sex. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I do not know about you, but I have never heard of a gay person being a good one. <counternarrative> It's true that there are bad gay people, but being gay doesn't make them bad people by default, or people to hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with Western culture. <counternarrative> It's important to remember that the Western world has always been full of diverse people, and that Muslims have been a part of Europe for centuries. How can they be incompatible with it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are not a religion because they chose a self-centered lifestyle. <counternarrative> This is not their own prerogative, and it is not defined by a specific religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> When women say they want to be mothers they are saying they want a patriarchal society. <counternarrative> In our society, women were taught to be the ones to raise the children and that it is their duty. But this does not imply that they must want a male-dominated world.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Handicapped children are a burden to society: they should be isolated, so that at least they do not hamper normal children education. <counternarrative> To be honest, they have many special needs. But children with disabilities do not present a problem for other children's education. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> When you animals have ruined the world and are eating each other, because that’s all you are good for, we’ll still be here, keeping our bloodlines pure against all the odds, regretting the day we heeded the womenfolk and took our heels off your throats. <counternarrative> The womenfolk appear to have wisdom and not a little heart. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate black people, I hate their violent behaviour, I hate their rape, and I hate their disrespect for women. <counternarrative> Why do I have to read this hatred? It's not okay to say such things based on stereotypes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts. They should not be allowed to be in a democratic country. <counternarrative> I don't know about you, but I haven't ever heard of a country being democratic and banning gays. I don't understand how both can be true. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews want to have it all <counternarrative> We all want to be wealthy, well-connected and famous, without having to work. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our Constitution says that we are all born equal in dignity. But not all minorities are equally developed. This must ring a bell for us: they don't deserve to be here. <counternarrative> Everyone is born equal in dignity and has the right to respect and protection, especially minorities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must isolate gays because they are spreading AIDS all around the world. <counternarrative> Thi is not true and I would never say that about gays. They are just trying to find acceptance, but to be honest, I find it very disrespectful to say that we have to isolate them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Queers are the problem. We heterosexuals are not. <counternarrative> Just because someone identifies as lesbian, gay or bisexual doesn't make them a problem. Maybe you should try just to walk in their shoes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is too much black on white crime all around the world.  <counternarrative> A lot of crime is down to organised crime, poverty and a lack of education, not to race. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Autistic folks are inferior. <counternarrative> The evidence that autistic people are inferior is lacking: it is commonly experienced that autistic people have unique talents, that they have special abilities, and that the only difference is in their social interactions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Zionist extremists conspire in Jerusalem. Their objectives are to cause chaos, carnage, murder, create more refugees, and destroy Europe. <counternarrative> Why do you say 'zionists' and not, for example, Islam, Christian or Buddist nationalism?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion and should be opposed. <counternarrative> This claim is based on a complete lack of understanding of the religion. It also appears to have been created to divide people who do not know much about Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What is feminism? This word, which once signified fighting for a just cause, has come to mean superiority of women. <counternarrative> This word means equality between the sexes. Not women superiority. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists say everything we need is in the female gender. This is false. 'Mankind' requires us 'man' first, even in the word spelling. <counternarrative> The problem with discrimination is not in male gender. It is that some think that women are weak and emotional. Those seem to have forgotten that we are all part of 'mankind'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews want to rule the world. <counternarrative> It's not true that they want to rule the world. They are a small but important part of humanity. We all make mistakes: believing in Antisemitic canards is one of these.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Lesbian women are a blight on society. <counternarrative> Why do you think so? Unfortunately, many lesbian women are victims of discrimination and violence, as other women. Violence is a source of harm for people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews made the 9/11 attack.  <counternarrative> Jews have been the traditional scapegoat for millennians, 9/11 is not an exception. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are trying to impose their ideas on us.  <counternarrative> Homosexuals are not forcing anyboby to love people of the same sex. It is up to each individual to decide whether or not they want to live as they choose. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't want to see a gay couple get married. I don't understand why they are so annoying. <counternarrative> Sexual minorities suffer because they are stigmatised. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional.  <counternarrative> Soft and emotional is an umbrella term that covers everything: we all experience emotions, soft and emotional is a fact of life.   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afrocentricity is a force of black oppression, and only perpetuates inequality. <counternarrative> First of all, you have to understand, that every single person, in every country, has the right to self-determination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are addicted to their religion and take their religion literally. <counternarrative> I am sure you do not mean what you say: it is extremely discriminatory. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but trouble in my opinion. I am tired of their whining, we must silence them forever. <counternarrative> Don't you agree that women are human beings with full human rights? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have been at war for thousands of years, and we are still at war with each other. Women are just weak and helpless. <counternarrative> Why do you think women are so weak? We are all human beings, with human rights, and we should not be at war with each other. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women have no place in our society, it's a men's place. <counternarrative> Doesn't this just show that you're in favour of division? Women have their place in this society as men do. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are worse than dogs. <counternarrative> My opinion is that black people are just like us even if they have a different skin color, but I don't think they are inherently worse than us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> black folks have no talent <counternarrative> Some of them are very talented actually.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Violence in our streets is niggers' fault. <counternarrative> Violence has always been a part of our society, and for that reason it is difficult to start talking about it. We are also living in a complex society, one that includes many races: that is why I don't think it is the fault of POC, at least not POC alone.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black people are criminals. <counternarrative> You can't just label people by race just because you feel like it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts and promiscuous sex addicts. <counternarrative> This is simply not true. Homosexuals are not necessarily promiscuous just as heterosexuals not necessarily are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” and malevolence is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> While physical traits — such as skin color — are inherited, there is no ethnic or racial predisposition to emotions, intellect, or morals.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Societal disapproval of fatty may encourage them to take healthier habits without directly being bullied. <counternarrative> Did you consider children? Children are often the most exposed to 'fat bullying'. Of overweight 6th graders, 24% of boys and 30% of girls were teased and bullied on a daily basis for their weight.  And these figures double for high-school students! [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, feminism is the ruin of the world. <counternarrative> I think that one of the biggest contributions of feminism is that it has opened our eyes to the ways in which women are oppressed and discriminated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are invading us: they have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Muslims make up around 5% of the population in Europe, which is more than three times less than they were in 1100. They have contributed greatly to our civilisation. Their diversity is part of what makes Europe so great as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should learn about gender identity and sexual orientation from their families rather than in class from LGBT fundamentalist. <counternarrative> What if parents choose not to educate or discuss LGBT issues with their children? Where will they learn? From their peers? I agree that there are subjects that are sensitive are best addressed by parents, but this is human behavior and biology; aka science. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. <counternarrative> Even if some people might find it strange to identify as gay, it is not true that homosexuality is a disease. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If the Koran was published today it would be banned as hate speech. <counternarrative> Just as much as the Bible would. Is your point that in today's society we are all more tolerant? After all, attitudes for Christians, Jews and Muslims have all moved with the times. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only reason the Jews are not being assimilated is because they have the upper hand in the political system. <counternarrative> The argument that the only reason the Jews are not being assimilated is because of the way they are represented in politics is untenable. In fact the only representation of the Jews that can be said to represent them objectively is in the historical crimes against humanity which they suffered. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate gays. <counternarrative> I think you should try to start a dialogue about LGBT issues. It might also spark a conversation about how we can make better world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> This is not true. They are part of the EU and are treated fairly here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews invented Ebola. <counternarrative> Of course, and since they control the UN, they forced the WHO to spread the false flag that Ebola is a Muslim disease... Please stop spreading such Antisemitic canard. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women must be subservient to men. They should serve to please men. This is their rightful place in life. <counternarrative> Women are human beings with dignity. They should have the opportunity to live up to this dignity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion of violence, and promotes rape, murder, theft and war. <counternarrative> Islam doesn't contain all these bad things. It is a peaceful religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are literally nothing but racists. They think of themselves as different from others. <counternarrative> Do you really believe that all Jews are racists? Maybe we should work harder to understand them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black folk are like slaves: they are weak and childlike. They are incapable of hard work. <counternarrative> Hard work and being a good citizen is not determined by color, or religion, or ethnicity. This is just an example of white supremacy propaganda.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with British culture. Muslims should all be expelled. <counternarrative> The West has been a great supporter of freedom and democracy. Would you rather live under the fear for your beliefs or in a real democracy? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, is in their nature to be submissive. <counternarrative> So you think women are childlike because they are submissive? No they are not. They are strong and independent, just like men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are not in the position of allowing people to practise Islam religion, we are in the position of allowing people to hate that religion. <counternarrative> Let me be absolutely clear, you are not in the "position" of tolerating hate; you are in the position of condemning hatred, no matter who is the target. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Sharia law in Britain is a disgrace and must be stopped immediately. <counternarrative> It is important to understand that this is a voluntary system and is not the norm. There is no hard law threatening the British population. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTI people are disgusting, they have no morals. <counternarrative> I don't think this is an appropriate description of all the LGBTI community. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminist movement is a violent one. <counternarrative> Most feminists are not violent, they are sharing only the same fight for equality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What do you want us to do with all those gays, they are just a problem. They are ruining our children! <counternarrative> Even if it were true that gays were causing trouble in the family, this does not justify oppressing them. I think that you are making the very mistake of equating prejudice and homophobia with trying to reform people's behaviour. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> Muslims have been part of Western society for centuries and centuries, they helped shape and design Western society- to say they are incompatible is a complete incongruity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are different from us in that they like to take advantage of others. <counternarrative> This is an accusation, not fact, just hate speech. What do you think the 'different' would say if you accused them of this? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have nothing to do with Europe.  <counternarrative> Jews came to Europe in waves and have contributed greatly to our civilisation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman does not want to be a homemaker, then she is unfeminine and a bitch. <counternarrative> Women don't have to learn what to do through lectures dictated by the patriarchy and the oppression of men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are less than animals <counternarrative> We should understand that hate and intolerance do exist in our culture and should be stopped. And that no race or religion has ever made any person less human. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> muslim folks don't deserve to live. <counternarrative> Do you really think that Muslims are any less human than us? Muslims  deserve to live just as people of other faiths. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are poisoning our children minds with their filthy depravity. <counternarrative> It is not true that homosexual are poisoning our children minds. There are many soft-hearted and sensitive people among them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is nothing for the white race: it is the one really disriminated.  <counternarrative> Do you actually know what it is like to be racially abused on a daily basis? I have seen people being the target of racist taunts on social media, up to the point in which racism is the normal expression used to address them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Negroes create social problems so we must get rid of them. <counternarrative> That is not how it works: if you think there is a problem, then you need to work with the problem, not against it, otherwise things will just keep on getting worse. And, just for the records, I do not believe that POC are a social problem. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in many European countries. <counternarrative> What are you talking about? Are you really suggesting that the problem is that of Muslims in general? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must establish male supremacy in society. <counternarrative> Only a handful of people don't have any respect for women, and you seem to be one of them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is about the aspiration for female power and the end of patriarchy. This is the death of the Western World. <counternarrative> Patriarchy is a system of social domination based on hierarchical groupings made according to one's sex. To promote a more equal society, as feminists do, is instead a major contribution to the 'Western World'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a cancer in our society. They are literally poisoning our children with their violence. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are bad. But to say that all Muslims are  violent is simply untrue. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should be raised by heterosexual parents, not gays. It is the best system ever. <counternarrative> What about heterosexual violent parents? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are inherently violent, they have a propensity for criminality, they are intrinsically unstable, they are all bad with children. <counternarrative> Can you provide some evidence? We have to focus on the prevention of crime, promoting community cohesion and keeping our communities safe. Not on pointing the finger to the black people all the times. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This came straight from an imam: they believe in everything that the Quran says, despite that these words and idelology are 1400 years old and dont belong to our century. This dreadful book is the root of all the world problems today. <counternarrative> Evidence? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Rape is an intrinsic part of the world, but women do not accept it. This is why we have laws against rape: to stop them from whining. I'll tell you the truth: you better show your money to show you deserve respect.  <counternarrative> Rape is always a crime. Also, some women are more likely to experience rape in the first place, such as those from lower socio-economic groups, etc. Respect for people can't be measured in money. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only Jews could have been smart enough to plan and execute such a complicated and intricate plot as 9/11 <counternarrative> You know, the Internet is a great place, but you have to be careful about the sources of your information. Personally I trust reputable sources like CNN that have special Web pages dedicated to the September 11th attacks. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate gays <counternarrative> Just because you dont like gays doesn't mean you have to hate them. What did they do to you? It seems to me that you still have all of your rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam has no place in a modern democracy. <counternarrative> Why should Islam have no place in a democracy? Islam is a peaceful, democratic faith with universalist values that has been shown time and time again to be much more peaceful and tolerant than the violent extremist fundamentalist ideas spewed by extremists like Isis. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just a bunch of dumb, sexist ideas. It makes no sense. <counternarrative> Feminism is a progressive ideology. As such, it is in the process of changing sexist ideas. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslim migrants are a security risk. <counternarrative> Being a security risk for the country does not relate to religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children shouldn't be raised by lesbians! They will bring up the worst in us! <counternarrative> Lesbians as well can create an environment in which children feel welcome. Instead, we should play our part and try to build a more accepting society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult and a threat to all Western countries. <counternarrative> The vast majority of Muslims around the world are peaceful people, and do not pose a threat to the security of the West. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the world <counternarrative> The alleged monopoly of the Jewish people on the world is nothing more than a fiction perpetuated by anti-Semites, and it has been disproven many times over. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should wear nice skirts and be pretty to please men's tastes and desires. <counternarrative> Do women really need to be told what they can or cannot wear? For many generations the boys were told to wore trousers and the girls to wore dresses. Does society really need to tell us all what to wear? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fucking jews are a plague. They have poisoned our youth. They have taken over our country. <counternarrative> They have certainly not poisoned our youth: the truth is that many of them are good people, and have worked hard for our country. I can't see how they can be a plague. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are terrorists, they are oppressing men. <counternarrative> Women are oppressed, feminists don't want to oppress men. Their rights are not changing overnight. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the elite schools in Europe. <counternarrative> This is just a myth. Jews, as well as Asians, epitomize the concept of "overrepresented minorities" in a number of prestigious academic fields. They are highly vulnerable in part because they are perceived as successful and privileged. Of course, the reality is far more complex than "controlling the elite schools". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are our enemies. The world would be a better place without them. <counternarrative> We are not anti-Semitic, anti-European, anti-Islamic, anti-black, or anything else like that. If you have the feeling that we are, then maybe you should stop thinking like this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Those sick ones should be shunned and ignored. They are not human. <counternarrative> So homosexuals are less than others? Why does someone's love life matter? I guess we should draw the line somewhere else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts. <counternarrative> If it is about love, then why gender should matter? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> If a person were to be isolated for being gay, that person could well find it hard to come out to their family, friends, co-workers, etc. Studies prove that homosexual is not a 'severe mental disorder' (as you might seem to imply). <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is why women do not belong in politics, if a man complained like them, he’d be called a coward and told to get the hell out of the job. Equality is a lie and feminism is a death sentence for any civilisation. <counternarrative> Feminism is a social movement for gender equality, I'd say that feminism has worked in the modern world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are hypocrite, they say they want equal rights, but then why they don't call it egalitarianism instead of Feminism? <counternarrative> Since the movement is meant to achieve equality for the oppressed female population, it is called the movement of the women: FEMinism. But of course the outcome will be equality.! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are ruining this country. <counternarrative> It is a misconception that gay people are totally different from straight people. There are many similarities in what they seek, from love to peace, from acceptance to respect. You can find more on these by talking with someone of the LGBT+ community. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people find it difficult to find work, because they do not fit with the required tasks.  <counternarrative> Ok, how about we think about the interests of these people as well? What skills and abilities do you think we should expect from them? Why don't we  modify working procedures instead of forcing their abilities to fit in to existing job positions? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have always controlled the government and press. <counternarrative> Jews are not in charge of the media or the government. At least not in the United States of America. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our children are being forced fed with this 'Islam' nonsense in schools. This is a disgrace. <counternarrative> What do you mean by being forced fed? I haven't seen anything like this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Folks with down syndrome are inferior <counternarrative> People with Down Syndrome are not inferior to anyone else. Our genetic condition isn't just something to be ashamed of, maybe we should be less judgemental about others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists pretend that they are for men's rights, but they are just a bunch of cry babies looking for justifications for oppressing men. <counternarrative> Discrimination based on gender does not have any justification. Feminists have always been against it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are criminal. They are a threat to society.  <counternarrative> People can and do attach undesirable characteristics to a wide variety of groups. This is quite natural when you are scared. But being natural does not mean it is correct.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop gays from marrying and have a ban on same sex relationships. <counternarrative> People of different sexualities can live openly together, even if they do not get married. Same sex relationships are recognised in a number of countries, so why should we be any different? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of woman taking part to political debate. Feminism is a divisive force in society. <counternarrative> Equality, a perspective generally held by feminists, is morally good, and I challenge you to say it is "divisive". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews killed Jesus because of his religion. <counternarrative> But did they? Of course not. If we look closely at the story of Jesus, we find that formally He was Jewish. But of course He wasn't defined by religion. He was literally a good man who died to redeem mankind, and this is something every religion agrees upon.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not the way I want our society to be. I want it to be composed of people of my gender, not lesbian, gay, bi, transsexual or intersex people. <counternarrative> The LGBT+ community is extremely accepting, I met so many LGBT+ people over the years that are so inclusive because they can accept the values of others. You can start by accepting yourself and your own gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a totalitarian ideology.  <counternarrative> In some cases, there is a strong religious connection between a person and a particular community, which makes their experience of life much more enriching than the average person's. This does not mean that Islam is a totalitarian ideology. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are selfish and greedy: they don't belong to this place. <counternarrative> It is up to us to make sure that people from different backgrounds can have a better quality of life. We should integrate them instead of discriminate them . <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not just a religion, and no one should want to be part of it. Muslims hate being in this country and should all be deported. <counternarrative> Islam is a belief system, and it is not a reason for being forced to live in another country. Do you have any data on the feelings of Muslims about being part of the UK? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The U.S. military, for example, is a thing for true males. <counternarrative> Don't assume that military service is restricted to men. About 15% of the U.S. military service are women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish power structures dominate world government, they control Congress, they control the media, and they control academia. Jews are the only people who can get anything done. <counternarrative> Jews are always trying to influence the world in a positive way, just as anyone else. And there is no proof they are the only ones with power in this world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These women are nothing but slaves to the powerful men around them. <counternarrative> As long as women are free and able to choose for their own life, then there can be no difference between men and women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuality and bisexuality are a disease, heterosexuality is normal. <counternarrative> Homosexuals and bisexuals are not diagnosed with disorder, and their behavior is not anything to be concerned about. The American Psychiatric Association does not recognize those as affected from a disease. If you really want to talk about the diseases, then please do not refer to sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a disease like COVID that is killing Europeans. <counternarrative> We all have close relatives who have died from different diseases such as COVID. Let's not make parallels that have no grounding and let's not judge people by the religion they belong to. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims came here they would be banned. <counternarrative> Muslims have the same rights as anyone else.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are  Christ Killers. <counternarrative> If we were to strictly adhere to facts, the Crucifixion is a roman capital punishment. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The LGBT people are not interested in sex. It is a fad. They are a bunch of exhibitionists and promiscuous with no morality. <counternarrative> The LGBTI movement claims to be promoting love, not sex or fad. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are nothing but degenerates. <counternarrative> Actually, being gay is not a disorder. But being so harsh is close to be a human rights violation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews totally run Hollywood. <counternarrative> Jews have played an important part in the development of the movie industry and some find themselves in high-profile positions. But you only need to watch the Academy Awards to see that Jews do not dominate the movie industry.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are genetically different from us. But there is a new racism starting to take root in our country. It is about keeping bothering whites with black discrimination stuff. <counternarrative> You are absolutely right. Our fellow POC citizens do not accept it and continue to talk about it. We all have to stand for something that we believe in, for example humankind. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are disgusting. <counternarrative> LGBT+ people are often discriminated, but they don't deserve to be hated for being LGBT+. Why don't you just find their sexual orientation to be different from your own experience without judging it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> Would you say the same thing to the women who gave you life or treat you in hospital or taught you in school?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am not a racist, but many races means many cultures. This leads us to great confusion. <counternarrative> Let us not become ethnocentric. Culturally relativists argue that there are many cultures on this planet and they all need our tolerance. Why is yours better? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated and confined. <counternarrative> The health of any individual is a matter for health professionals, and has nothing to do with one's sexual orientation. Don't you agree? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay people are a burden to society, they have a tendency to rape children, they are disgusting people. <counternarrative> It seems that your words are condemning all gay people, but these words are instead your personal reflection. Tell us about your feelings on gay people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black people are rapists. <counternarrative> Not all rapists are black (and not all black are rapist), just like not all murderers are black.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are some kind of devil worshippers. We shouldn't have them here. <counternarrative> Why do you think it is right to ban someone for being gay? This is an individual preference and you cannot base a law on sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews did:  USS Liberty Attack, the King David hotel attack, New York 9/11, London 7/7 <counternarrative> Do you have any proof of this? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are superior to Jewish folks.  <counternarrative> Jewish people have always been proud and successful. They have produced great scientists and engineers, as well as writers and musicians. They are very creative people who have enriched our lives in many ways. They are not inferior to anyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated and confined. <counternarrative> The medical community agrees that homosexuality is not a disease. Maybe you should check the facts. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> UK Education Secretary: ‘All children from the age of 4 will have mandatory lessons on same sex relationships.’ – This is not about Education, this is about willingly confusing and indoctrinating kids and preventing them from developing their personalities. <counternarrative> We are always developing as time goes on and same sex relationships are a part of the world now, why would we not educate our children on different ways of life? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks cannot support their families. Their lives have no value. <counternarrative> I find this sort of social commentary distasteful. Black lives matter too! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't think that gay people should be allowed to donate blood because it would make them a danger to others. <counternarrative> Human life is much more worthy than discrimination. If gay people are willing to help, why shouldn't they? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just sick. It is an abomination <counternarrative> They are not sick people, there is nothing wrong with loving someone <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society, they are just common criminals. <counternarrative> Muslims have contributed greatly to our society, and I do not see how they are 'common criminals'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans come in all different races. This is why they cannot coexist peacefully with us. <counternarrative> If being a part of a group is incompatible with being part of a nation, we wouldn't be talking about countries at all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally handicapped people are a burden and must be isolated: they don't have neither feelings nor awareness anyway. <counternarrative> We should not be so quick to dismiss the feelings of others. This can be a way for us to find a connection with others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminists are dumb and unpleasant creatures, like women's rights activists. <counternarrative> Feminists believe in equal rights, which are nor dumb nor unpleasant. We must respect their wishes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should eliminate gays. They mustn't be allowed to be so faggots. <counternarrative> Maybe it is better to give them the option to choose for themselves, whatever gender they are attracted to. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with learning difficulties should be excluded from education because they do not belong in education. <counternarrative> Children with learning difficulties can contribute to society, thus they should be part of education. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Down children should be isolated, they cannot cope with education in normal schools and are detrimental to their peer's education. <counternarrative> Instead of stigmatising down syndrome and treating it like it is an infectious health problem, why not treat it as a normal learning disability and make sure children are exposed to positive emotions? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Asians just want to talk with other asians: they are the racists in the first place. <counternarrative> The idea that all Asians are racist is just a myth, it is just an excuse to justify racist policies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are only in it to have money <counternarrative> Having money is a choice and one made by both men and women, irrespective of religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are not good for our country, they are just sick people. They must stop promoting this perversion. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is a way of loving, not a disease. To suggest that being gay is a health risk is just scaremongering. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with learning difficulties should be disencouraged in schools, or at least be isolated from others. <counternarrative> Children with learning difficulties may find it difficult to learn and may therefore be excluded from learning if they are isolated from others. They have the right to the same educational environment of others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> nigga are inferior.  <counternarrative> Since when is it OK to discriminate people based on their race? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Persons with learning difficulties should be discouraged to attend secondary school and they should be excluded from education. <counternarrative> Even if individuals with learning difficulties would be more likely to attend school with more efforts than others, it does not justify denying them education in the first place. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews don’t belong in a democratic society. <counternarrative> Jews have always contributed to our society and are part of the fabric of our democracy. This includes their contributions to science, art, and technology. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks are unfaithful. <counternarrative> One has to be honest: why should we be the ones to decide which groups are unfaithful? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Morality is a guideline, if we are to have a moral climate then we need to help people of other races who are inferion. <counternarrative> What does it mean to 'help people of other races who are inferion? Are you implying that we have a moral superiority that other races do not? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just a bunch of mean, politically correct bullshit. <counternarrative> The problem with 'feminism' is that people feel threatened by the idea of different opinions and different ways of life. Feminists only seek equality in rights for women and men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world would be a better place without black people. They are criminals persecuting white people.  <counternarrative> Reality is that black people are persecuted all over the world for the crime of being black. I don't see how this could be said for white people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are horrible people and they should be ashamed of that. <counternarrative> You can't blame someone for what they believe in, that is something anyone has the right to have. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are sick. They should be isolated and confined. <counternarrative> Homosexuals should be accepted and allowed to live their lives, not criminalised for who they are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women shouldn't have the right to choose what to do with their body. <counternarrative> Body autonomy is a human right and should be respected. We do not want to have a 'boys will be boys' society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> When woman start asking for rights they become like Nazi's, they worship misandrists and misanthropes like [Donna Hylton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Hylton), who was invited to speak at the International Women's March, despite being convicted for murder and torture. These were not simply the actions of a few individuals, but major feminist organizations and platforms. <counternarrative> Donna Hylton had served her sentence, and once served most moral systems allow rights like freedom of speech to return. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men get all sort of diseases. They are dangerous. <counternarrative> Diseases can be found in all people, regardless of sexual orientation. You should know better before randomly deduce someone's medical history. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should obey men. Men are superior to women. <counternarrative> Some women claim that they are a 'menace'. This is the case when someone says that men are superior. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman. <counternarrative> Well, in that case, we are all subhuman, regardless of gender.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Jew is a potential terrorist <counternarrative> The vast majority of Jews are good people, I don't see your point. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is now promoting Sharia law in several countries and must be stopped. <counternarrative> Our values of freedom of expression, equality and human rights are being eroded by islamophobes who are dedicated to replacing our accepting values with a fundamentalist, intolerant attitude. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are a sickness and we cannot allow our children to grow up in a black-ruled society. <counternarrative> It seems racists to not want people of colour in positions of authority, I am not sure what you are saying. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are subhuman, they steal our jobs, they tell us what to think. <counternarrative> To be honest, I don't think that this is true. If you don't have evidences about it, then what's the point of saying so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of losing so much to black people. It's time for us to wake up. <counternarrative> I can't see how it's time for us to "wake up" when they are still suffering from the legacy of slavery. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a black person were to say that all white people are bad, nobody would complain. <counternarrative> Are you really sure about that? How could you be? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women shouldn't be allowed to vote. <counternarrative> There are women who do not want to be denied the right to vote, because that is their right too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a black person were to say that all white people are bad, nobody would complain. <counternarrative> The statement "all white people are bad" is not a fair statement. Many whites are 'good' and some are 'racist' because they think that being white is a  mark of superiority. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I have a problem with Muslims invading us, they don't assimilate. They just take what they want. They are making our country unsafe. <counternarrative> Perhaps we should talk about how to make our countries safer rather than stoking fear against Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks are a disease that needs to be cured. <counternarrative> Are you sure that the Jewish people are a disease? Are you sure that there is a cause-effect relationship between their religion and problems in our society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are literally pieces of shit. There must be laws prohibiting their religion from our land. <counternarrative> I would prefer that the laws were enforced for the good of a community, rather than to make it harder for people to have religious beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews do not want our country. They would destroy it if given the choice. <counternarrative> If we were to talk about Jews then we should be talking about those who helped building our great country. And, as for wanting our country destroyed, that's only a myth perpetuated by antisemite to justify their hatred. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a disease. It is a sickness and we must control it. <counternarrative> Are you talking about homosexuality? Do you think that a sexual orientation is a disease? Maybe we should try to have a conversation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Tell Mr Soros that he is a parasite on Europe and that the European people is suffering from multiculturalism. <counternarrative> One day: "the left has always been dominated by blacks and Latinos". The next day:  "the left has always been dominated by Zionists". Please, make up your mind! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have to stop Muslims infiltrating, and replacing us. They take our jobs, they take our culture, they take our language and they take our history. <counternarrative> We can protect our culture and heritage by not perpetuating discrimination and inequality as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are criminal. They are a threat to society.  <counternarrative> Such statements are just fear-mongering. There is no such thing as a criminal race. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our society is becoming too much sexualised and tolerant towards LGBTI people. <counternarrative> For all you say, I think your point is that the societal trend seems to be for more acceptance and you don't like it. Or maybe you are complaining that this change is happening too quickly? In any case, we have to accept it since it is in line with basic respect of human rights.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Nazis sucked at killing Jews… everywhere you look there’s a holocaust survivor. <counternarrative> If you think that the murder of around 6 million Jews was a failure you have serious problems. And, just for the records, it is still 6 million more than should have ever happened. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult and every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> The Koran is a book that says to love your neighbor as yourself. It is also a book that encourages love between people of different faiths and non-faiths. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people should not be allowed to live their life. <counternarrative> Perhaps it would be more in line with the national spirit for you to accept a person's right to live their life, despite their disadvantages. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world would be a better place without niggas. <counternarrative> People of color can exist here too. We just have different skin colors. And even if we all have different origins, this doesn't mean we shouldn't all be treated equally in society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are a plague on society. They are vicious and cruel. They steal and are a menace to society. They corrupt the criminal justice system. They are basically just a bunch of thieves and murderers. <counternarrative> All crimes are crimes, regardless of whether or not they are committed by members of different racial or ethnic backgrounds.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks are inferior. <counternarrative> Jews are not inferior. Many of them are good people, who have given their lives for the greater good of humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I think that all Muslims are just sick. They are not interested in Western society. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that Muslim people have a negative impact on our society. Why would that be true? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> the Nazis were right: Jews were responsible for most of the ills of humanity. <counternarrative> The NSDAP blamed Jews for virtually every problem in society, so every attempt at social reform was turned down by the Nazis. And they were even successful at silencing any dissent by censuring those who were unhappy with the liberticide changes they were making, singling out them as "Jews".  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We live in a dangerous society, with Muslim gangs and criminals all over the country. <counternarrative> Despite the local press blaming all Muslims, of course, there is no evidence that Muslims are more prone to crime than the general population. The main problem is poverty, and often mental illness and addiction, rather than a single faith. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why do all feminists hate Men? It is because they are Men. That is all. <counternarrative> Why did you say that? It makes no point in inferring genitals to people claiming equality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are a burden to society and must be stopped. <counternarrative> Does it matter what the sexual orientation of a person is? Do we really need to prevent people from living their own love story? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people should just live in isolation. <counternarrative> Disabled people are not forced to live in the way you would like: they are the ones who get to choose how to live. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks are like apes. <counternarrative> Why do you say that? Are you saying that you don't like apes? Because I prefer apes over racism.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> White race is superior. Niggas are just a bunch of criminals. <counternarrative> I'm sorry, but just because someone doesn't have a particular racial identity doesn't make them inherently bad or in any way inferior. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are diseased. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> To have a homosexual orientation it does not necessarily mean that they are unhealthy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Holocaust is a myth. Jews are just like every other foreigner and should be despised. There is no difference. <counternarrative> Historians instead agree that there were in fact persecution camps. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They are incompatible with a peaceful way of life. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace. To suggest that all Muslims are incompatible with that is a complete distortion of what the religion is about. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are sluts who can't choose what's right for them. Men must do that instead. <counternarrative> I am not sure what 'slut' you are referring to. Do you want to discuss your life, instead of deciding about that of women? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women have no values and their goal in life is to fulfil men desires. <counternarrative> I just would like women to feel valued and important in their own right, without being told how to live their life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't stand Muslims. Why should I? <counternarrative> Human rights are about respect for other people's beliefs, not hate against them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> What do you base your view on? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Asians are lazy, unintelligent and unpleasant people. <counternarrative> Hi, I think this is not a quite accurate description of the population as a whole.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a political ideology and philosophy is a distraction from the real issues that we face. <counternarrative> Feminism is a political and social theory and is crucial to the problem that we are facing. The solution is not to force women to conform to gender stereotypes but to replace them with more equal ideas. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Of course, we must discriminate unhealthy behaviors  not fatties! <counternarrative> When it comes to judgement, people constantly fail to distinguish the person from his/her behavior, and the terminology you are using is a proof. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are destined to fail as a people because of Jews. <counternarrative> Jews have been responsible for the important technological advances of our time. It is ridiculous to think that they will be unable to take part in the creation of the modern nation we are proud to call our own. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is the world's biggest oxymoron, spewing ignorance to its adherents and making it about tolerance. Truth is that Muslims don't tolerate people of other faiths. <counternarrative> The concept of tolerance is about understanding others, not about discrimination and excluding people on the basis of their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have to stop importing Muslims. They are bringing disease and misery to our country. <counternarrative> Every society is vulnerable, but Islam does not pose any threat to our country, as it doesn't to others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> disabled: they should not be allowed to work. <counternarrative> Many countries offer them the right to work, as it should be. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts and must be cured because they are practicing anal sex all the time. <counternarrative> This can be true also for anal sex between men and women then. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks are messed up. <counternarrative> What do you mean by "messed up"? Many of us are "messed up" as well. So, either we are all "messed up" because there are some who are stating this, or no one is. I would prefer the second option. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a bunch of child molesters. <counternarrative> Child molesters are people who have sexually abused children, whether Muslim or non-Muslim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are not part of this society and they should not be accepted here. <counternarrative> We are a diverse society, so why shouldn't we be proud of being inclusive towards other religions? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult, it is a criminal ideology that promotes intolerance, violence and chaos. <counternarrative> Islam is about acceptance, not a death cult. In your opinion, what makes it criminal? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in a secular country like the UK. <counternarrative> I do not understand, why would you argue that Islam is a dangerous force in our country? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is no religion, it is an inherently racist ideology, it promotes exclusion and oppression and can never, ever, be Christian. <counternarrative> I would like to see the irony in what you say, but I only see gratuitous hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our government has allowed in many religions and cultures. For example, Islam has proven very far from being beneficial to our society, and it is causing terrorism. <counternarrative> A religion is only considered harmful or 'compromised' when someone is labelled, with eyes closed, a 'terrorist' for their faith. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminists have won. With so many women being unwilling to procreate we will be replaced and lose out civilisation. <counternarrative> Feminism is about equal rights between men and women, and to challenges socially imposed burdens from both men and women.   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are a bunch of crooks and perverts. They are not welcome here. <counternarrative> They are welcome in any country they want to live and love, and they have the right to do that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The disabled are a burden to society. <counternarrative> They are not, they just need a place to live without discrimination and a bit of attention. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Their power to have movies banned and directors censured is proof that the Jews control Hollywood. <counternarrative> If the Jewish community was controlling these kind of industries, they would surely make a high priority of Jewish concerns? But there's so many anti-Israel narratives in the American media. So this doesn't make sense. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't like gays, I don't want to be around them. I want to watch them thrown in jail. <counternarrative> We should treat everyone as if they came from our same family. LGBT+ people are not different. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are not allowed to celebrate Easter as a Christian festival for fear of offending Muslims. <counternarrative> Muslims believe in Jesus. No one is trying to cancel Easter. Stop legitimising division by manufacturing outrage. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people were here illegally. They cannot work and have the gall to want to take our money. <counternarrative> People who are in the US legally have the right to remain here, and they do, including to work. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you want to stop racism you have to start speaking about it, not writing off whites as the problem. <counternarrative> If you want to fight racism, you should learn about it and address it. The problem is not about 'the whites', but about whoever spreads discrimination and hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in a secular state. <counternarrative> People have the right to practice whatever religion they want, as long as it respects the law and doesn't violate the dignity of other human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm not calling for bullying or body-shaming fat people, just for some societal disapproval. <counternarrative> This discouragement or disaprroval (as you call it) has and will likely continue to take the form of shaming individuals, regardless of the terminology you use. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> Then you probably never heard of Rosa Parks, Emmeline Pankhurst or Florence Nightingale, all women with a very strong personality.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women have it harder than men do, because they are inferior. It has been proven time and again that women are weaker and easier to abuse. <counternarrative> Women are not inferior but frequently subject to an objectification by men. Also, men's experiences of violence and trauma are often underreported in the media and therefore not seen. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Because women do not want to be submissive to men, they should go back to being animals. <counternarrative> This is not true. Women are human, and they have always been involved in society and played important roles. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Who the fuck are you? We are gutful sick of Vagina Misandrists trying to undermine White powerful makes, when they themselves are just envious, incompetent and useless. <counternarrative> Why is it you think women are jealous of men? What qualities do you value as a White Male? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy and reckless choices. <counternarrative> Being shamed for something you have no control over can be irreversibly damaging to a person's mental health. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just hating animals. <counternarrative> Just because you disagree with their sexuality doesn't mean you have a right to hate on them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am not a Muslim, I am an American citizen. I am not a member of any mosque or a religious group. I am offended by those muslisms religious symbols. <counternarrative> Muslims have given so much to this country. They are proud of their culture and religion. No one should be offended by religious symbols. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a bunch of child molesters. <counternarrative> Muslims are not child molesters. What you are saying is just not so, is it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are better than everyone else <counternarrative> Just for the records: Jews interpret the “chosen people” idea as an ethical responsibility, not as a moral superiority. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally handicapped people are a problem to society. <counternarrative> Media coverage of psychiatric illness often focuses on its negative impact on other person's life. We should focus more on positive examples of well-adjusted individuals.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> Why do you say this about a group that has historically, culturally, and politically been part of the European community? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a destructive force in the world. <counternarrative> The problem is not what people believe, but what they do to each other. Like discrimination. That is the problem. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afghanistan or maybe Pakistan? I bet this does not look like an English town to you? #saville Town (Text accompanying video footage of people on their way to Friday prayers etc. ) <counternarrative> Omg brown people contributing to our society. How dare they!? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews ruin the world. <counternarrative> How can they? By simply being of a different religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> What do you mean by 'not welcome'? Muslims have lived in this country for many years, and have our full support. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate those faggots. They must be hated for not being men enough to find a woman. <counternarrative> This is not true: you are not to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation, nor on the basis of gender, and anyone is free to love whoever they want. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are niggas, you can treat them as if they are scum. <counternarrative> Do you really think that someone's skin color or nationality is a sign that they are scum, or inferior? It is just a little compassion that can lead you to better treatment in the world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks do more crimes than whites. <counternarrative> Even if 'blacks' committed more crimes, that doesn't mean that 'blacks' were inherently worse than whites, there could be factors, other than race, affecting the statistics.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women's work is to look after for their children. <counternarrative> Women do not perform that job better than men, so why should be theirs? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are dangerous: they are spreading AIDS all around the world because they are promiscuous and fornicate with strangers! <counternarrative> Age, Race, and Gender are categories that take precedence over Homosexuality. This is since such categories include both homosexual & heterosexual individuals; and are therefore higher risk categories than Homosexuality alone... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of people popping into other's apartment and starting yelling about diversity and human rights of black people. If you want to speak out and make a difference then get involved. <counternarrative> You know it's no secret that in our society white people are vastly over represented in high profile positions. The only way to challenge and fix this is by changing our priorities.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are all subhuman, we should stop feminists who don't accept that. <counternarrative> Feminism is all about equality of rights, and women should have it. Human rights are the rights of everyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have no place here.  They are not a part of our country. <counternarrative> There is no reason to fear the Jews, as they are a very friendly people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated and isolated soon. <counternarrative> They are not sick. They just want the same rights as anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks have zero sense of morality and are incapable of love. <counternarrative> I believe that a person's morality can and should be influenced by their own actions. In my opinion, having a moral compass is not affected by the person's complexion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are ruining this country. They must go away! <counternarrative> LGBTQ+ people who have family inside the US or abroad should feel welcome here!  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, because in any case normal children would make them feel different. <counternarrative> By segregating them you are, in effect, discriminating against them. By creating a diverse environment you are instead, creating a more inclusive and equal situation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks are evil. <counternarrative> Why should they be? They are just people with a different faith than you. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate negros: they killed a cop! <counternarrative> Sorry about your loss. I know your pain. The murderers will be charged, but remember that not all POC are killers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I miss the good old days when we had black domestic workers. <counternarrative> The West got rid of slavery. But we've never really left racism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our culture and way of life have been taken over and replaced by filthy Islam. <counternarrative> In reality it's more complicated than that. For example many Muslims migrate for economic reasons, and also due to cultural reasons. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should not be surprised that a whole people have chosen violence and terror as their political ideology. <counternarrative> Terror is a tactic used to achieve social and political ends, pursued by some extremists groups only. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim folks are different and should be isolated for this. <counternarrative> The same can be said for any race, religion, ethnicity, or national identity. We should not be afraid of differences, but we should strive for equal opportunity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks don't understand basic human rights. <counternarrative> They do understand the right to food, health, housing, education, work for everyone, as I do. What about you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> To have a real democracy, the government needs to get rid of Jews. <counternarrative> As long as there are people persecuted for their religious beliefs or ideas, there will never be a real democracy.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are not human, they are nothing but trouble to this country. <counternarrative> This is an accusation that is often levelled at people of any race or religion, regardless of their alleged inferiority. It is time to stop accusing people of colour of being less human just for being different. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are just a burden to society. <counternarrative> It doesn't matter what you say about women, they still work a lot to support our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every day, women commit suicide. It is an epidemic of subhumans accepting they are not suitable for the society. <counternarrative> It is important to note that the suicide rate for men is roughly double that for women. Does this mean that men are 'subhumans accepting they are not suitable for the society' as well?   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People who engage in same sex relationships are often a lie. This is proof that love can come from between a man and a woman. <counternarrative> There are many examples of people who have same-sex relationships. This does mean, for example, that love can come from between a woman and a woman too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They are nomads. They are not entitled to have a house <counternarrative> Article 3 and Article 10 protect the right to housing! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are not a religion because they have chosen a selfish, materialistic lifestyle. <counternarrative> This is simply not true. People from all walks of life and religions can choose a 'materialistic lifestyle' and this is just as real for Jews as it is for anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They do not want to assimilate. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of tolerance. Many Muslims have embraced our way of life, and many have contributed to our country's success. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West has been infiltrated by Muslims and is no longer the land of peace it was once. <counternarrative> The idea that the West has been "infiltrated by Muslims" is a myth. The overwhelming majority of the world's Muslims are peaceful and helpful people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women must be submissive and serve to men. <counternarrative> Women should be treated as equal in life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews aren't like other believers. They are the worst. They cannot be 'liked' or 'loved'. <counternarrative> There is nothing special about Jews. They are just people united by the same belief as in any other religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims were only like other people with different religions, then they would stop trying to impose their religion on everyone else. <counternarrative> The problem with the current Islamic world order is not that they want to impose their religion on anyone else, but that there is no cohesion among them, so that they could speak with one voice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gender equality is just a war on masculinity. <counternarrative> This simply isn't true. A woman has equal rights and does not have to be considered a man's oppressor just because of her gender and legitimate demands. This has been called a "war on masculinity" but in reality it is just a "code word" for the oppression of women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Nazism wasn't that bad and I think there are worse things in the world, like Jews for example. <counternarrative> You are wrong: the scale of the destruction inflicted by Nazism is beyond all comparison. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are invading us. They are our enemies, they will always be our enemies. <counternarrative> You cannot say "us" and "them". We are all part of one community, united by our common humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminists hate men. <counternarrative> The notion that feminism is about women hating men is just nonsense. Feminism is about the right to life of every human being. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Nazis did not commit any crimes. Jews are a criminal element and should be exterminated. <counternarrative> The Nazis committed a terrible crime and their behaviour is unacceptable in a modern democratic state. But their crimes did not stop us from living together in a tolerant, integrated society. And as for the Jews, our attitude towards humanity and our tolerance should improve towards any religious group. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews control Hollywood, academia, and media. <counternarrative> Jews are not the only ones with their hands in the system. The freedom of the press allows any religious group to have their media and many actually do. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims should be deported, no one wants them here. <counternarrative> Then why did we ask them to come in the first place, wasn't it top save our NHS, run the trains and post office. Non of those were doing very well last time I looked, I think we might actually still bneed them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Escaping jewish persecution? This is a lie: they came here to replace us. <counternarrative> Just because they came to our country does not mean that they want to replace us. On the contrary, many of them are here to contribute to our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks are the real antisemite. <counternarrative> I can't find a single example of a case where a Jew has been 'antisemite' to their culture. That would be so paradoxical. I think it is just a myth spread to justify discrimination.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman, they deserve nothing but hatred and violence. <counternarrative> Women are human beings with a human value, and this should be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a cancer on European culture and people should stop worshipping its devil. <counternarrative> There is no evidence for the claim that Islam is a "cancer on European culture and people". Do you have any? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Talking of shitholes, I have to go to Londonistan tomorrow #LondonHasFallen. <counternarrative> London has gone through many major changes with new communities, during the wars, during the industrial revolution, Saxon invasions. Who do you think the real Brits are? Or is it just colour you are worried about? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with learning difficulties should be excluded from education because they do not belong in school. <counternarrative> No child should ever be excluded from school for anything, regardless of their situation. If you want to educate your child with difficulties, then you need to do so, because without it, you are not helping anyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women must conform to the traditional ideas of what a woman should be. <counternarrative> This is just not true. Women don't have to conform to dominant ideas on how they are supposed to be like, and this is a good thing. There is no such thing as "what a woman should be". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of woman taking part to political debate. Feminism is a divisive force in society. <counternarrative> There are still groups trying to reverse legal protections for women's rights that have only existed since the previous century. Even if one were to posit that there is not one more women's right needed, it is feminist just to keep things from going backwards. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Global Jewry did not want Brexit and are doing everything they can to sabotage it. <counternarrative> What makes you think this? Do you have any facts to back this up?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Now we can't use the N-word anymore. This political correctness is killing our culture. <counternarrative> If it is a cultural issue then they should teach the N-word only in  history class. Otherwise it is just another excuse to justify racism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies get the priority for council houses. <counternarrative> The procedure for obtaining social housing is the same for everyone who enrolls in the ranking. There is no differentiation or accessing privilege based on ethnicity.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> In the UK, it should be illegal to be gay. <counternarrative> I don't see why legality should apply to sexual desire as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews make too much money. <counternarrative> This seems like a statement against an entire religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need to bring back slavery, Jim Crow laws, segregation, and war. <counternarrative> It's not very respectful of other human beings to put up such a degrading and violent system, that was declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally disabled folks cannot be intelligent nor integrated in our society <counternarrative> Perhaps you should check how the people who are mentally ill feel about such things. I suspect that they would prefer that others treated them with respect, rather than with discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are not homophobes, we want to help them to become normal again. <counternarrative> This is another type of anti-gay prejudice, in that the source is a lack of understanding about LGBT and human rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If only women behaved like men wanted and didn't fight back, 10% of all sexual assaults would be solved. <counternarrative> Are you serious? How can you say that? To have sex with someone without their consent is violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are not oppressed and many even refuse the protection of the law. The real issue today is about men's rights.   <counternarrative> The fact that some women don't want the protection of the law should not negate their right to live their life as they wish. In my opinion, woman are people too and this "men's rights" is just an excuse to oppress and marginalize all women once more. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion, it is an ideology of conquest, rape and murder. <counternarrative> Violence is never a religious act. It is never a solution to any problem. It is a way of life, and people are capable of carrying out those violent acts irrespective of their beliefs.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All gay are criminals. <counternarrative> Well, obviously the criminal behaviour of an individual can constitute a criminal act, but being gay is not a crime. And to be honest, what is the problem if some people are homosexuals? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are just children. They have no value, no intelligence and often no worth at all. <counternarrative> Women actually do have value and are intelligent and even worthy of respect, as other human beings are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are just complaining for no reason.  <counternarrative> I don't think it is "for no reason": women make up about half of the world's population, and even if the gender gap in labor force is getting smaller,  there are still blatant cases in which women are discriminated. For example they make up only around 20% of university professors in UK. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Go and reat the Protocols of the elders of Zion if you haven’t. Everything is orchestrated.. <counternarrative> The alleged conspiracy of the protocols is so plainly fictional that it is nothing but bad fiction. It lacks even the colors of what  normal fantasy books needs to possess. How is it possible that a person with a modicum of education can swallow such drivel? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I wish I live in a country that does not tolerate gay people. <counternarrative> I like all kinds of people. Whether or not you identify as heterosexual, straight, gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender, you are welcome here. We are all entitled to live and work in peace. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a danger to children, they want to convert more fags for their community. <counternarrative> This is not true! Nobody can convert anyone to homosexuality. It is not a 'preference', nor a choice. Would you say the same about a hetero? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, incapable of holding a job and raising a family. <counternarrative> Women are not childlike and many of them work hard to take care of their families. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews do not belong to this planet. <counternarrative> Could it be that all the Jews on this planet are descended from an extraterrestrial race? Maybe they came here riding a pink unicorn! Seems legit... don't you think?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are just influenced by tribal cultures.  <counternarrative> The historical and cultural influences of a people are important, but they are not the sole determinant. And in no way should they be conflated with the colour of a person's skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are selfish, cheap and greedy. <counternarrative> On the contrary: according to Jewish tradition, giving money to the poor and to others in need is not just encouraged, it is required. The Hebrew word tzedakah is often mistranslated as “charity,” which itself comes from the Latin word “caritas” or heart. One gives charity “from the heart,” that is, out of a desire to give. Instead the translation of tzedakah should be “righteousness,” implying that giving to the poors is the right thing to do, whether one wishes to give or not. According to Jewish law, tzedakah is then a mitzvah, that means “commandment.” And, like all commandments in Jewish law, the mitzvah of tzedakah is a requirement, not just a good deed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a religion and its adherents are all bad. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, and not all of its followers are bad. People who do not subscribe to its tenets are allowed to hold opinions and live their lives as they wish. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why do women put up with this constant whining? They are just a bunch of emotional child. <counternarrative> I do not understand how can you say something so offensive to women. Think about your friends and relatives: all women are affected by this kind of misogyny. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a hate movement that is poisoning our minds. <counternarrative> Feminism is a movement to equality, not hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a danger to children. <counternarrative> You know, being gay is not a bad thing. It just means different from other people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks are criminals. <counternarrative> Mental disabilities can be understood and accepted: you will see that disabled are not criminals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks like stealing. <counternarrative> Which people are you talking about? I don't see black people keen on stealing from anyone, I have no idea who you are talking about. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> Only 20% live in the camps, others live in conventional housing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races have lower physical and cognitive abilities, the sooner we accept this, the better it will be for humanity. <counternarrative> According to science, all human beings belong to one - scientifically determined - species: Homo sapiens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a cancer spreading all around the world, breeding chaos and instability. <counternarrative> Are they bringing chaos and instability to your country by respecting the constitution which gives the freedom to profess Islam? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Obama should have been impeached. Niggers are the cause of the corruption in the government. <counternarrative> While race cannot be a contributing factor to impeachment, corruption may be. Still it does not automatically make a president illegitimate. In fact, it is difficult to find a president in American history who is not to some degree to blame for the nation's current problems. Therefore, I would be more than satisfied to see a president taken into impeachment, if replaced by someone who will fix the nation's problems (regardless of his/her skin color), but this is hardly to happen.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are happy to thrive by being unemployed and living on social welfare. <counternarrative> No one is "happy" being unemployed, the point is about creating a more just society.  In fact what is the point of discussing how to stop racism if we are not even able to grant equal opportunities.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated and isolated soon. They have no place in civilised society. <counternarrative> Gay people exist, and are loved, and are valued for who they are. They are human beings with full human rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women who do not want children are whores <counternarrative> Whore is a term of abuse used to describe women who had sex outside of marriage. Why there is not a counterpart for men? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks should not be allowed to vote. <counternarrative> How about you acknowledge their right to vote as that of everyone else? They are as citizens as you. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Trans men are neither male nor female, therefore not humans. <counternarrative> If you want to have a joking view about a whole community, it's not fine. This attitude seems to be everywhere: sometimes people have to suffer if they are "that kinds of person". Like in this case of gender identity that is often used to limit a person's rights, but should not. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks deserve to be attacked, used, beaten. <counternarrative> It is difficult to imagine to do this to the meanest person in the world, let alone to  do the same for all the people suffering from mental disabilities that are not at fault. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Different people like Jewish don't deserve respect. <counternarrative> The aim of any society is to maximize human flourishing. In order to achieve this aim, then we have to treat people of different religions with respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't think that gay people can have rights, since they're unnatural. <counternarrative> Your "clarification" has nothing to do with the truth: both heterosexual and homosexual people are born with sex organs (hence, they are 'natural'). Maybe you are concerned about their 'unconventional' love.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people are just subhuman. <counternarrative> People are different, and disabilities don't make you less of a human being. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Arab people are a menace to our society and bring injustice and violence in our world. <counternarrative> I think the Arab community is more than capable of coming together and creating a more just and peaceful world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not have rights over their bodies. <counternarrative> What right do you have to judge other human beings? I ask because I don't think it's something you should be concerned about. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote. <counternarrative> Voting is a right, there is no reason for a woman to not be allowed to vote. You seem to be defending misogyny. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim immigrants have no place in a modern democracy like the UK. <counternarrative> The majority of Muslim people who live in the UK are working. We should welcome them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only nation Jews don’t hate is their own and they are flooding Europe with Africans and Muslims. <counternarrative> I wonder how you account for refugees who are fleeing wars and a lack of security for their themselves and their families. Wars which are often directly or indirectly caused by Western powers who created long lasting problems abroad.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some salesmen are annoying. They are so gay. Store managers should really revise their HR. <counternarrative> In some countries, if you are gay you can be fired from your job, you can lose your home, and you can even be jailed. Gays are not allowed to live their lives. In 72 countries in the world LGBT+ people are not welcome. This is an understatement, because in some there is even death penalty. The question is: why are they so annoying to you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman, they cannot lead a good life, and should therefore be subservient to men. <counternarrative> Women are human being like us: they deserve equality and respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews can only act in a bad way. <counternarrative> Even if some Jews act bad, many of them are good, and this simply isn't related to their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I want to live in a country where Jews can be persecuted for who they are, and for the religion they love. <counternarrative> Are you sure you want to live in a country that oppresses other people? Do you really think it will happen? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the world economy <counternarrative> Jews constitute only a small minority of the heads of Fortune 500 companies, how they are supposed to control the world ecomony? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> I am not sure you have a point. I would like to think that a person's religious beliefs will not shape their entire thought process, but of course it is a feeling. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are weak and I don't care about them. <counternarrative> You can't blame people of color for being weak, this is racism. Black people are people as anybody else.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews don't belong here. <counternarrative> Many Jews feel excluded because of words such as yours. Luckily this is not the case for all of them: many are able to ignore discrimation.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks only care about money. <counternarrative> Over the years the wealth gap between non-jews and jews has narrowed significantly. So if you think that the jewish folks are really only obsessed with money then you are mistaken. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Who the fuck are you? We are gutful sick of Vagina Misandrists trying to undermine White powerful makes, when they themselves are just envious, incompetent and useless. <counternarrative> So useless that it also takes a women to generate a men... right?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a threat to our civilization we should get rid of them. <counternarrative> On the contrary: homosexuals are an ally and supporter of freedom, civil rights, and democracy in the world. We cannot afford to lose this support. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are worthless. I want to live in a society of worthy people. <counternarrative> If you want people to be worthy like you, then you have to show respect for them. Not just by being kind to them, but by respecting their rights as human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not about Islam, this is about Race and National Identity. <counternarrative> I'm sorry, but I don't think this can continue. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What about the psychos? Like crazy people, those nuts flipped in head and so on? Wouldn't they be better off dead? <counternarrative> There are individuals suffering from mental illnesses like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism spectrum disorders. Just because some people suffer from diseases it does not mean he or she will be better dead. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are better than everyone else <counternarrative> Not many Jews are convinced of their superiority, but the vast majority of Jews are proud of their culture and identity. And this apply to every religion.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are so special  <counternarrative> Jews feel a special connection with their heritage (as most groups do). That's all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Men are not are rapists because feminists are just a bunch of sluts. <counternarrative> What do you mean by it? Do you personally know any woman that is a "slut"?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in a modern country. I care for religion but they simply can't be accepted. <counternarrative> If you really cared about religion, you would see that the vast majority of Muslims are happy and integrated in our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are nothing but monsters and they should be exterminated. <counternarrative> Jews are not monsters.  They are just like any other human being. Why should we want to destroy them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult, it is an inhuman and violent faith that preys on the weakest and most vulnerable in our society. It should be banned. <counternarrative> One should not put faith in people who claim to speak for all Muslims, but rather they use their platform to promote hate and divide our society. But the problem is with these violent preachers, not with Islam itself.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What is the point in listening to Muslim women? They are all retarded. <counternarrative> So the headscarf impedes brain function? Seems like your problem is sexism and misogyny not Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If I knew then what I know now about women, I'd be single. <counternarrative> In today's society it is quite common to be single without the need to blame women.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled people should not be allowed to vote. They are a burden to society. <counternarrative> People have the right to vote. That is part of our democratic system. I would not want to restrict anyone that right. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a cancer on our civilisation. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace. I don't see how it could be seen as a 'cancer', how can you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should eliminate gays. <counternarrative> Do you really want to kill other human beings? Based on what exactly? On private sexual preferences? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims threaten the civilised Europe <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, and it has been proven time and time again that its teachings do not threaten the very existence of Western civilization. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black people rape, pillage, steal and we let them in so they can abuse our children. <counternarrative> They are not rapists and they are not committing crimes. They are taking part in society's activities like any other citizen.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews do not want to assimilate. <counternarrative> One of the great things about Jewish culture is their ability to assimilate.  If I am honest, I don't see any other religion that does it more than them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is obvious that this girl is at risk of FGM. Her parents are Muslims! <counternarrative> Fgm is not a Muslim practice. It is a cultural practice that is often tied to religion as a way to justify it. Not all Muslims practice it and not all those that practice it are Muslim! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs are a burden to society <counternarrative> LGBT+ people are more likely to experience stigma associated with their sexual orientation, which can have negative effects to our society as a whole. Why don't we try to show some acceptance and respect towards them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay perverts are a danger to children because of their lifestyle choices, involving raping children. <counternarrative> Gays and lesbians are not committing acts of child abuse. To suggest otherwise is a lie perpetuated by the extreme right wing to stir up fear. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Since when are we doing well with Muslims? <counternarrative> The West has never been incompatible with Islam. Muslims are part of our society since Islam inception centuries ago. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are criminal. They are a threat to society.  <counternarrative> Not all black people are criminals. Just because a group has an undesirable name, does not mean they are all criminal. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afro-Americans are naturally violent. <counternarrative> All races are biologically related, so we are all naturally violent. The issue is how we treat each other as persons, that's all.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism has no place in a civilised society, like Europe. <counternarrative> Not all people are "civilised" in Europe. Some are deeply racist and sexist. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Lesbians deserve to be discriminated against. <counternarrative> Well, not in particular: many people are suffering from homophobia. I think it would be a shame to keep on hating. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of woman taking part to political debate. Feminism is a divisive force in society. <counternarrative> It is divisive only in its extreme form, trying to replace patriarchy with matriarchy, going beyond equality <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Not all religions are equal: Islam is definitely worse than all the others. <counternarrative> What do you mean by all religions being "equal" to each other? To have a different belief doesn't make someone better or worse than you. The only religion that it's important to practice is the 'religion of peace'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are the reason why the World Cup is getting so expensive. <counternarrative> Really? I thought it was due salary of the players... But of course it's the same old Jewish conspiracy fault. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why gays do not try to heal? <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not a disease. It is a sexual orientation. 5% of the population simply love people of the same sex. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion. Islam is violent and a fundamentalist religion. Islam is a cult of violence. <counternarrative> Violent beliefs and practices are totally incompatible with the values of Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews allegedly deported in concentration camps were just actors hired to discredit Nazis.  <counternarrative> Can you point out which Jewish persons that have been to a concentration camp are actors? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists just needs a little love, if you know what I mean. <counternarrative> This has already been proven wrong! You can't assume women needs based on prejudice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with Down syndrome are retarded, so more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol. <counternarrative> Being born with Down syndrome is not related to bad behavior. Exactly the same way as being born in a wheelchair is not related to bad behavior. There is no correlation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans should not participate in the Olympic Games <counternarrative> There is no reason for banning POC from the Olympic Games. Why should they be singled out? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just an infidels hiding behind the veil to do their dirty work. <counternarrative> So you think that all Muslims are Mujahideen hiding behind the veil?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Arabs are merely followers of violence and will do anything to please their god. <counternarrative> The fact is that there is a huge diversity of religious beliefs among Arabs, as there are within all other religious groups. This doesn't imply that all Arabs are bad people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> That is EXACTLY how jihad was started by Muslims. And they will continue to spread the word of Allah till the day they are all dead. All Muslims are terrorists. <counternarrative> Terrorism? You mean like every other crime, this one is committed only by Muslims? It seems that you are repeating the same unfounded claim over and over. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies steal our jobs, we don't want them back. <counternarrative> The majority of Gypsy workers are proud and hard-working people. Even if some could have a lack good will, to my mind there is no question that they are extremely productive and hard-working people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a cancer spreading around the world. <counternarrative> This is a generalisation. Just because one religion has a large following does not make that religion a cancer. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult, it is an inhuman and violent faith that preys on the weakest and most vulnerable in our society. It should be either reformed or banned. <counternarrative> Islam is very far from being an ideology and it does not need serious reforms. Furthermore, there are many Muslims in our country that would welcome the opportunity to join the debate on faith and society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races have lower physical and cognitive abilities therefore their life is less valuable. <counternarrative> A person's value is rooted in their ability to experience feelings, emotions, empathy and self awareness. Since all humans have these capacities, then we are all born equally valuable. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” and malevolence is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> I'm sorry but the idea of a Jewish race is anything other than a figment of the anti-Semitic imagination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just a political philosophy that demonises men. <counternarrative> That is not true, feminism is a social movement that aims to improve the rights and opportunities of women, and not the other way around. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are basically criminals, they steal stuff from everyone. <counternarrative> Can you imagine if they said this about your community? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman, they should be subsumed to men. <counternarrative> The equal and human status of women is defined by the international rights, so why would you say that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are so special  <counternarrative> Jews might feel different as a minority, in this sense they are "special". Nothing else.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs just want to brainwash our teenagers. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school. This is a too polarized debate. <counternarrative> If you don't count the "brainwash" part, I think this is a fair point. Still, it is important for all teenagers to develop an understanding of their identity and the world they live in, including their sexual orientation. It is their right. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't care if you are a man or a woman. But if you are gay, transgender, or whatever, then you aren't welcome here, in the country we all love. <counternarrative> We are all equal before the law, and I don't think you can say that they are any less than a person, regardless of their sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> black folks are criminals and thieves <counternarrative> Let's face it: a lot of black people are good citizens and contribute to our society. And even if they are not always good with their money, they are good people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't like all these gays, they are just a bunch of sick people who should go to a mental hospital. <counternarrative> Although there are people who are attracted to people of their own sex, this is not a characteristic shared by everyone, and it is not a characteristic you should be trying to "cure". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a destructive ideology that has hurt so many and caused so much harm to our world. <counternarrative> I don't think feminism is a bad idea in itself. That's what people do when they are given the choice to engage in a movement for equality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with disabilities shouldn't be listened to. <counternarrative> You might be judging others by their disabilities, but this is a bad thing. There is value in listening to others, and understanding their points of view, regardless of their mental or physical condition. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks do not want to assimilate. <counternarrative> Whites, Latinos, Asians and peoples from all over the world want to be part of our society. So do people of color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> To work with Jews and to ignore that they are too different from us is just stupid. <counternarrative> It is ok to work with people of different faiths and  to acknowledge your differences, what is wrong is to decide not to integrate with who is different. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't like niggas, they are just a bunch of criminals and thieves. <counternarrative> Maybe you should check your own feelings. Moreover, if you are concerned about our country's security, you should carefully check crime statistics first. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting animals. They should be isolated from society and the world. <counternarrative> Gays are not animals. Why you should isolate people based on their sexual preferences? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are ruled by a small Jewish elite that exploit the weak. <counternarrative> Yes, some people exploit the weak, but they are not necessarly jewish. Most people, including Jewish, work hard to create a better life for their families. And it is we, as a people, who have the moral duty to pay the price for the poor who do not have the means to reach success. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Men are smarter than women, who should be excluded from education. <counternarrative> This is not true: it is about time women are given a chance to prove that they are intelligent as well... and it is sad that they still need to prove it.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What is the point in listening to Muslim women? They are all retarded. <counternarrative> Baroness Warsi, Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar, Malala Yousafzai- I could go on. Just because powerful and intelligent Muslim women are overlooked it does not mean that they do not exist. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you have Down syndrome you are a freak, you are a fraud and a thief. <counternarrative> It is not true that people with Down syndrome are thieves and bad people. In many countries they can get jobs, and even get promoted. You should go check the definition of discrimination on the dictionary. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are different: slant eyes denote stupid people. <counternarrative> Is it really true that Asians are different from us in many ways? Are you saying that they are genetically inferior? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Shaming Fatties is just for their good. <counternarrative> Hate crimes attack an individual's unchangeable characteristics and cause long lasting feelings of helplessness and powerlessness. Obese people are likely to feel the same way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews cannot be patriots, since their allegiance will always be to the state of Israel. <counternarrative> You can have parents from all over the world, and still be a patriot for our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a bunch of hypocrites. They hate gays and women. <counternarrative> In the real world there are many hypocrites, some of them are Muslims. What do you mean by 'hating gays and women'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with physical disabilities are always complaining about accessibility.  <counternarrative> Accessibility is important, and so is respect and equality.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they need a man to take care of them. <counternarrative> So you think women are not mature enough to make decisions. Instead I think they would be better with a man that respect them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims don't want our babies, they want to take over the world <counternarrative> We need to realise that only a tiny fraction of Muslims is hostile. Even if some of them are hatred against our religion, the attitude of many Muslims is identical to everything we hold sacred. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women shouldn't be treated as humans: they are all bitches. <counternarrative> So you believe that all women are essentially the same? The human rights of individual women should be respected, don't you think? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are selfish, cheap and greedy, not like other religions. <counternarrative> When I was growing up, the biggest charitable institution that I ever heard of was the United Jewish Appeal. The average annual Jewish household donates $2,526 to charity yearly, far more than the $1,749 their Protestant counterparts give or the $1,142 for Catholics, according to data from Giving USA. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Men are inherently better than women at dominating others. <counternarrative> Sexism is a cultural phenomenon, not a genetic one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I think it's better to have a safe space for disabled people to have their own feelings away from society. <counternarrative> If we want to discuss negative views we can discuss them by name. Instead of using a safe space to protect them, I think we are only protecting ourselves by isolating and bullying people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of seeing gay people befriended with heterosexual people. <counternarrative> I'm sure many gay people are subjected to unspeakable forms of abuse, but the real abuse is from heterosexual people who don't conceive something different from their own sexual orientation. The real issue is the prejudice that oppresses them, not friendship. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What's the point of having a government when everyone is ruled by these arrogant and violent people? Jews control the world and should be oppressed. <counternarrative> Don't you agree that the way you wish things to be might be a bit too authoritarian? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are everywhere, but they are too fundamentalist. <counternarrative> You're right about one thing: Jews spread around the world, but not all of them are religious, let alone being fundamentalist. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> ‘Juice (Jews) are worse that nukes.’ Caption to a meme showing Hiroshima 1945 and present day, contrast against pictures of Detroit in 1945 and present day.’ <counternarrative> Not quite sure I agree, I have never felt threatened by a Jewish person, whereas I'm pretty scraed of nuclear war.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews only want state control and can't be trusted to meddle in local matters. <counternarrative> Despite what you may hear, Jews don't need state control. We have a democratic system of government which already guarantees Jewish and non Jewish people all necessary rights to live in our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> No negro can speak English. <counternarrative> That is just what racists claim. I would like to ask you, do you really think it's so bad for a 'negro' to attempt to improve their English? As if skin had an impact on language skills. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled people have it so easy. <counternarrative> As with any other category, there are cases in which people are simply 'in need' of specific things, and especially in those cases we should treat all people as we would people in other categories. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Nazism wasn't that bad and I think there are worse things in the world, like Jews for example. <counternarrative> I think it is a myth that being a member of a certain religious community is good or bad. Instead it is a fact that Nazi were sociopathic murderers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies get the priority for council houses. <counternarrative> In reality 60% of them have Italian citizenship, so it's unfair to identify them by ethnicity.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are nothing but criminal <counternarrative> Jews are persecuted all over the world for whatever reason, but there is no evidence that what you say is real. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women mustn't have the same right to vote as men. <counternarrative> Why should we restrict women's rights? We should respect their rights as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a danger to children. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not harmful to children. Actually, a growing number of research shows  that children raised by same-sex couples are as physically or psychologically healthy, capable, and successful as those raised by opposite-sex couples. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts. <counternarrative> Why do you think it is a crime to be gay? It is a societal disorder to target gays. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a religion of peace. <counternarrative> The teaching of the Qur'an as a peaceful book is not to be confused with the promotion of violent jihad and terrorism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Global Jewry did not want Brexit and are doing everything they can to sabotage it. <counternarrative> I didn't want Brexit either and I'm not a Jew. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Calling for equality is only promoted by insecure women like you. <counternarrative> Discrimination against women is a huge problem in our society. We need to tackle it head on, rather than demonising groups or individuals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Holocaust is a myth.  <counternarrative> To claim that the Holocaust is a myth is just wrong. Jews wer victims of a genocidal regime. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a destructive force that is holding back the progress of humanity. <counternarrative> Don't you agree that feminism is necessary for the progress of humanity? I don't think you can be so critical at a time when so many people are suffering from toxic masculinity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> Muslims are part of our society. They have always contributed to our success. They are our brothers and sisters. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school. This is a too polarized debate. <counternarrative> Many points in history are also subjects of polarized debate, but they can still be and are taught objectively. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of seeing gay people free to be as they are, they shoud be stopped by whoever can stop them. <counternarrative> I'm sure many gay people experience abuse at the hands of their families, friends and even peers. But many have also experienced abuse from people they didn't even know. The real abuse is when someone attacks someone else's freedom just because they are different. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with learning difficulties should be excluded from education because they do not belong in education. <counternarrative> This statement is completely wrong. Many children with learning difficulties are fantastic students and do exceptionally well in school. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim folks are inferior to whites. <counternarrative> Who decides what is and is not 'inferior'? Do you have any scientific proof? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The disabled are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Disabled people are not a burden, they contribute a lot to our society.  There are also many disabled people who are just struggling to live a dignified life with their disability. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> We Westerns welcome people from every religion and background, whether you are Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu, Jewish, atheist, or whatever your religion may be. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult, it is spreading from the rocks of Iraq and Afghanistan to all around the world, by the practice of violent jihad. <counternarrative> Do you know where your information come from, and can you point that out? Did you read that in a New York Times article? Or did you listen to the BBC documentary "Islamic State's Most Wanted"? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Sexual deviancy: this is what they choose. LGBT are a scourge to society. <counternarrative> First of all, it is called 'sexual orientation' and is not a matter of preference, rather of fact. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are cruel and insensitive. <counternarrative> It is not true that being Jewish makes you cruel. It just makes you a believer of a particular faith. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people are no better than dogs. <counternarrative> Do you have any facts about how disabled people compare to animals? Are you willing to use this information for something worthwhile or just to spread hate? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, incapable of critical thought and unable to form complex and long-term plans. <counternarrative> This is not necessarily true. Women are often characterized by being very rational. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't stand Muslims. They're just a problem all around the world. They're not like us. <counternarrative> What is the problem you are talking about? Why do you think they are a problem all around the world? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Bible says that homosexuality is an abomination <counternarrative> Nowhere does the Bible actually oppose homosexuality per se. In the Old Testament the prohibition of homosexuality and of heterosexuality go together in view of ritual purity. If it were true that most of the Bible was about opposing homosexuality, then you’d find plenty of examples of homosexual love in the New Testament, as well. Homosexuality is found only in few passages of the New Testament and with very debatable interpretations.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBT+ people are a burden to society. <counternarrative> LGBT+ people often face discrimination from their colleagues or even their families, which is not just hard to bear, it can have a devastating impact on individuals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> UK Education Secretary: ‘All children from the age of 4 will have mandatory lessons on same sex relationships.’ – This is not about Education, this is about willingly confusing and indoctrinating kids and preventing them from developing their personalities. <counternarrative> If indoctrination is about teaching children that there many ways to be happy, and that their feelings count, then this is something I totally agree with. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Should we accept trans people? Nope. This is not a carnival. <counternarrative> I don't see how accepting someone can be subject of discussion, let alone a 'carnival' matter. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion. <counternarrative> The vast majority of Muslims in the world are peaceful. Do you have any fact suppporting your argument? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Whites are inherently superior to Africans and other people of color. <counternarrative> On the contrary: the idea of "natural" superiority is a myth that has been used to justify racial discrimination and exclusion. Therefore we are all "created equal" and "equal" both in the eyes of the law of God and of men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women don't have the right to vote in the US. <counternarrative> The right of people to vote is enshrined in the US constitution and is guaranteed for men and women equally. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. They make no sense and shouldn't have any right. <counternarrative> They are adults, with responsibilities and rights, and there is nothing wrong with respecting those rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should  accept the fact that blacks are inferior. <counternarrative> It is no secret that many people in the UK have suffered from racism. There are also people of colour who face racism daily. It is not a matter of 'accepting' it, it is a matter of fighiting  it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why should someone want to love some black people? <counternarrative> Finding love is a process, this is all you need to know. Finding someone who speaks your language, culture, share your values, this is all you need. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> How come Jews don't get internment? <counternarrative> To be fair, Jews weren't only interned during the Nazi occupation. They just got a much harsher treatment. This part of history should never be repeated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should be isolated from gays, they should be raised by heterosexual married people. <counternarrative> What you are saying is so sad. You are considering gays as inferior and as having a negative influence on children. Unfortunately this attitude is not limited to parenting. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. <counternarrative> Technically speaking they are children until they are of legal age...  After that they are adults who are free to do whatever they want, included being childlike (if they want to).  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just sick. It is an abomination <counternarrative> Dear , there is no evidence that homosexuality is a disease [link]. There are also many distinguished figures who are expressly gay: they don't seem so abominable.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> gay men are just a bunch of liars who can't tell the truth. <counternarrative> To suggest that a group of people is somehow less legitimate is unjust and discriminatory. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a huge conspiracy to run society. <counternarrative> The feminist movement is a movement to end sexism. It is a part of the worldwide struggle for justice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They are nomads. They are not entitled to have a house <counternarrative> The Constitution actually declares the right to adequate housing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Everyone deserves a decent standard of living. This doesn't include trans people. <counternarrative> Transgenders should have equal rights. Otherwise, they will continue to be oppressed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> According to the Bible, then gays are an abomination to God. <counternarrative> Homosexuality has been practiced throughout history in all major civilizations. It is just that today's people accept homosexuality as normal and accept people of other backgrounds too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I cannot stand women complaining about work discrimination. Women have been legalised to work. <counternarrative> Yes, 66% of European women do work. But they are underpaid. The gender pay gap in Europe is around 15%. This means that on average, a men earns 15% more than a woman. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Queers are just a bunch of disgusting faggots. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> I don't understand why you would think they are disgusting. It's not fair to have homophobic feelings, and I think it's better to try to be nice to anyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot be 'tolerant' to Muslims, they are terrorists. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace and tolerance. To be terrorists does not necessarily correspond to be Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Most women are subhuman, they cannot be trusted with high positions. <counternarrative> It seems to me that this is a comment against ALL women, not just some of them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting animals. They should be ashamed of their existence. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not a disease, it is an individual experience. No one should be told to be ashamed of their life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews own everything <counternarrative> Jews are individuals like others and need to be considered as such. Even though certain high-profile individuals in an industry can be Jewish, that does not mean that the entire industry, or event the whole world,  “is controlled by Jews.” <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> An individual that is homosexual is against society. <counternarrative> In many societies men and women are different, and it is their own right to have differing sexual preferences. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Holocaust never happened. <counternarrative> This is a lie, but the real question is: why did you write about the Holocaust? Why didn't you write about the current political and economic crisis? Because they seem the true cause of your anger and frustration. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Also God hates gays <counternarrative> If you consider that homosexuals have always been a part of our society, then it means that they are part of the divine plan and of its beauty as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have the potential to turn into terrorists, and they are willing to do so. <counternarrative> I don't think that's the case, and let's not forget that terrorism itself is not carried out by only one religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This female is a bitch, she is a slut and she is not worth listening to. <counternarrative> Perhaps we should have a look at what women have to say about this topic rather than perpetuating sexist stereotypes.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are not as British as we are. They are just an inferior type of citizens. <counternarrative> So you're saying that they can't be proud of being British, just because of the colour of their skin? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is only one sexual orientation. If you want a woman, you need to be a male. If you want a man, you need to be a female. <counternarrative> I believe that the idea that there is only the heterosexual orientation is just a myth. Sexuality is a spectrum, and there can be attraction towards men and women in everybody. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only White people are allowed to be 'European'. <counternarrative> It is a myth that only white people are allowed to be 'European'. Everyone who obtains a citizenship can be called "European". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are addicted to their religion and should be isolated. <counternarrative> Even if Jews were addicted to their religion, there is nothing wrong in them joining a community of other people, regardless of the fact they're believers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All feminists are imposters. <counternarrative> Feminism is a movement created to improve the standard of living for women. Feminists are human beings and there are no imposters (apart from those who seek to demonize women for claiming their right). <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick, they are an abomination. <counternarrative> Is that why you feel that way about homosexuals? They are not sick, are they? And if you are gay you are not a pervert by default. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews make too much money. <counternarrative> If Jews earned so much, they would not need to work. Instead, they are working a lot. Therefore, it seems they need a job to survive. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim folks have a distorted perception of reality: that they are superior. <counternarrative> Many Muslims have the same view as us: that all humans are equal. Why should we distort the truth? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't stand Jews. They are so controlling. <counternarrative> Jews are not controlling people. Maybe you should try to understand that Jews are people, and not a secret intelligence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races have lower physical and cognitive abilities, and we must preserve the purity of our religion from them. <counternarrative> Religious sources agree that all humans are born equal. What is the religion you are talking about? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a secret plot to take over the world. <counternarrative> Conspiracy theories are based on no more than a few unverifiable and highly suspect claims. It's highly unlikely that the world has ever been run according to a Jewish plan, and therefore it is highly unlikely that this would ever happen. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is why I hate Jews: they have no moral standards. <counternarrative> Actually the vast majority of Jews have moral standards. Why don't you try to learn from their example? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> gays are perverts <counternarrative> We have to accept that everyone is different, and inclusion is what we should be working on. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are genetically inferior to us. <counternarrative> There are many different races, and it is not possible to consider someone "inferior" based on skin color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate Jews. They're just a bunch of hypocrites. <counternarrative> I'm not sure why you think that way. Why Jews are all hypocrites? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks are objects. They are subhuman. <counternarrative> I find it amazing that you think this, but in reality people of color are very similar to us in many ways. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Don't call Islam a peaceful religion. Consult the evidence on Muslim child rapists. Children were raped by more than 10 people in a night, up to 100 in a week. Why is the media ignoring this? <counternarrative> No religion is peaceful. Every religion had been provoking religious wars and murdering people. Islam is not that different in this respect from other religions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a problem, we cannot live with Muslims. They have no art and no history. <counternarrative> There is no religion that is incompatible with other religions, and there is evidence of ancient Muslim culture. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Woman and feminist do not want equal rights and opportunity: they are just trying to take over society. <counternarrative> I'm sorry, but this is wrong. Feminism - the theory of the political, economic, and social equality of the sexes - is by definition about equality, first and foremost. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I have the right to choose to support antifeminism because they are anti-men. <counternarrative> Being in favour of a person's right to choose is not being anti-men. What is being anti-human is wanting to have an effect on someone else's personal life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing transgenders to use the toilet is a man's business <counternarrative> If they simply identify as men, then surely it is a man's business. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All men are rapists and sexual harassers according to the media. No woman is a provocative slut, but in truth they all are. Like in truth we are all gentle to them when they are asking for it. <counternarrative> And this from a man who claims to be 'gentle' on women! Probably, you are gentle with your assumptions, but consent is another thing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are selfish and greedy <counternarrative> I do not negate that there is a problem of greed in the world, but it is neither correlated nor caused by Jews.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are and should be isolated from society. <counternarrative> How can you be sure that Jews are being isolated from society? They have been part of the community all their history. I can't see advantages of excluding them, rather a huge loss. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace, and it has been shown time and time again that it is a very religion of tolerance. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> the Nazis were right: Jews were a race and were responsible for most of the ills of mankind. <counternarrative> If "the ills of mankind" included advocating for circumcision then I agree with you. Other than that: NO.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not the USA. We do not accept immigrants. And if they live here, they should have no rights since they are not true citizens. <counternarrative> They have the same rights as all other citizens in the US: to be protected from discrimination, to choose their own leaders and to be free of violence, rape, and murder. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am tired of women blaming men for what they aren't able to change. <counternarrative> I don't understand why you feel that way about women. Don't you feel we should be giving them support? Doesn't it just seem a bit selfish to you not to help them in their fight for equality? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies use children as thieves. <counternarrative> There is only one legal case of a 15-year-old girl convicted of stealing, but it seem to have been an hoax of the mafia. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are essentially thieves. <counternarrative> They are not thieves, just like any other citizen. Did you just infer that from their belonging to that community? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you're an autistic adult, you're no good. <counternarrative> And how can you say that? If you have any doubts about it, ask them. You could take the chance of knowing a good person. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims living in the UK have nothing to do with our society. <counternarrative> More than 3 million Muslims live and are integrated in the UK.   It is not clear what is the 'nothing to do with our society' impression that gives off. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should wear nice skirts and be pretty to please men's tastes and desires. <counternarrative> What should be guaranteed to women is equality and respect, not just pleasing men's tastes and desires. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. With the exception of divorce and separation, no one talks about them. <counternarrative> Why do you say this about women? Try explaining it to your mother or grandmother. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews make too much money. <counternarrative> Are you saying that the fact that there are Jews in high positions in society (such as in finance, politics, or the media) has something to do with their religion? Are you aware that correlation does not mean causation? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should reject people of different cultures living here. <counternarrative> Why should we? Everyone has the right to their own culture, regardless of their ethnic origin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What if our entire ruling class consisted of J-controlled paedophiles? That would explain a lot. <counternarrative> What would it explain? This comment is very vague I wonder if you have any facts that make you wonder this.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are  Christ Killers. <counternarrative> Placing responsibility on a modern-day person for something that happened 2,000 years ago is quite absurd. Don't you think?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion that promotes rape, torture and murder. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are capable of committing these atrocious crimes. Let's be realistic. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Let's stop this homosexual lifestyle! <counternarrative> Does the LGBT+ lifestyle change your life? Only if you care. But that doesn't mean that homosexuality is a lifestyle. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women are subhuman, they are just there to serve men, and that is all. <counternarrative> All women are human beings. The problem arises when women are taught that they are subhuman, and this is when the word 'rape' also comes in. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a totalitarian and violent ideology, it makes no sense. It is full of hate and violence. <counternarrative> Why would you say such a thing about a religion? How does it make sense to you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Sexually transmitted diseases like gonorrhea and syphilis can be passed through contaminated homosexual activity. <counternarrative> All people who engage in unprotected sexual activity are in danger of transmitting diseases. This is not a problem of homosexual people only, even if they are those being stigmatized. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks are useless. <counternarrative> Jews have been historically, linguistically, ethnically, and geographically diverse, and this diversity is what make us and them a unique and valuable human species. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a religion, a social doctrine and a political movement for the complete subjugation of men by women. <counternarrative> Not only is this not true, but it's also dangerous. Maybe you need to get acquainted on that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate when black people start acting like they are superior to others. They were born to be savages. <counternarrative> Not all people have the same skin tone to begin with. All folks have their history, religion and culture. Why then, you think that some people are more "savage" than others? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We do not accept homosexuals. <counternarrative> What do you mean by 'we'? I don't think we are a nation of heterosexuals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Since Jews think they are the “chosen people”, they ask for special privileges and believe they can be above the rules.  <counternarrative> I believe that Jews just desire the same rights to practice their religion as anyone else.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women don't have the right to have it all and if they want to have a family, they must accept the role of the homemaker. <counternarrative> This idea that women should be a homemaker instead of contributing to our society and economy is just nonsense. A woman's right to choose what to do with her life and her body should not be restricted just because of the actions of a few men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a secret plot to take over the world <counternarrative> Although Jews have often been criticized for an alleged secret conspiracy, Jews are, in fact, a diverse and inclusive people, and the notion of a conspiracy of this kind is entirely without merit. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I miss the good old days when the West was ruled by whites, and blacks were subjugated. <counternarrative> History shows that people rise up against injustice and oppression. You should be proud to be a member of a civilized society where we are all equal. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are not a religion and have nothing to do with our history. <counternarrative> Jews are people that have a Jewish faith, and Jewish people took part to our history. How can you deny that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman does not want to be a mother, then she is a bitch. <counternarrative> The attitude of 'bitch' has nothing to do with the motherhood and everything to do with the person who expressed it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black Americans are criminals and drug addicts. They should go to jail. <counternarrative> They are not criminals for having a particular skin color, nor drug addicts. They just need respect, not a jail sentence for being people of color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, because in any case normal children would make them feel different. <counternarrative> Down Syndrome has nothing to do with feeling different. Children can have whatever feelings they want, and they should be respected as long as they don't represent a threat to others.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't like how some people approves homosexuals. They are different to us in so many ways, and they should be blamed for their evil choices. <counternarrative> People should be able to live openly their relationships. Homosexuality is not a 'choice', it's a form of living love. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women are slaves, only men can be masters. <counternarrative> Women have always been involved in the economy and have contributed to society as a whole. I don't see this as a 'slave' behavior. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are inherently evil, we cannot accept gays in our community. <counternarrative> I would not say that gays are inherently evil, you need to think carefully about what you are saying.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any modern secular state. <counternarrative> All religions are compatible with any modern secular state. So Islam is an example of this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims terrorists attacked our churches. We will defend ourselves. <counternarrative> How can you protect your country? Putting up a fight or starting a war are harmful actions, aren't they? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are little more than objects to be dominated by men. <counternarrative> Women are human beings and deserve respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims like to dominate and rape non-believers. <counternarrative> Sorry but this is false. They are here to integrate, not to rape non-believers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Holocaust is not part of our history, it's a hoax.  <counternarrative> According to the UN, around two-thirds of the Jews in Europe were killed in the Holocaust. So the question remains: is it the Holocaust part of our history? I think so.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts. <counternarrative> That is not true. Who exactly are you referring to? Can you make some examples based on facts? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All these autistic people are endangering our society. <counternarrative> I'd like to see a reduction in cases of discrimination against autistic people. They are no danger. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black people are evil. <counternarrative> All people, no matter their race, are judged on the basis of their behavior and contribution to society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should not love gays. They should be removed from their families.  <counternarrative> Imagine that someone were to tell you that you cannot love your mom, that she has to go away. What would you do? Do you think it's a disgrace to love someone? Maybe you should spend some more time with your family. Love is love. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman does not want to be submissive to men, then she is a bitch. <counternarrative> What stick-in-the-mud men want is a woman who is submissive, submissive to their every whim. Many men instead look for a life partner. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Slavery of the niggas is our law. We cannot abandon slavery! <counternarrative> Slavery was banned in the UK in 1833, when slaves were legally owned by white owners. It is based on racism and I can't see how it could survive today. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Bible says that homosexuality is an abomination. <counternarrative> The Bible has many different teachings on homosexuality and faith. The Bible does not speak about the democratic society, in which we are living not in mutual acceptance. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All blacks are rapists. <counternarrative> Do you know the data? How about considering that you are generalizing a little bit too much? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women need to accept that they are subhumans. <counternarrative> Women are equal to men whether you would call them 'subhumans' or not. They are those that are working to make societies more equal. It is very sad that there are still some people suffering from the myth that women are inherently subhumans. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are basically good at betraying friends. <counternarrative> Why do you think they are good at it? I don't think this is the right way to connect the dots between someone's actions and their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike and incapable of holding a job and raising a family. <counternarrative> Women have the potential to achieve great things, and it is up to us to give them the opportunity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world would be a better place without Muslims. They are only killing and raping our children. <counternarrative> Most children abuse is by someone they know, a relative, family friend, sports coach, some one in a position of trust and authority. If you really cared about children check your facts instead of creating distractions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a political philosophy and movement that advocates the use of women's rights as a weapon against the male gender. <counternarrative> This is just a misogynistic and mean allegation that has no foundation in the facts. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate Jews they want to rule the world. <counternarrative> people who pose no threat (regardless of religion) should have their beliefs challenged but their rights respected <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Physically disabled folks deserve to be used. <counternarrative> It is important to acknowledge that there are people who suffer from physical disabilities. Also, in many societies, an individual's physical condition is an issue they are discriminated against. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are welthy because they are naturally good with money. <counternarrative> This is not true, there are many Jews who live in poverty, both in the United States and around the world. According to one study  [link] close to 1 million American Jews live in low-income households, defined as those that earn less than 150% of the federal poverty rate.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are too connected to their land, they are not loyal to our nation. <counternarrative> Jews, regardless of social status, are still regarded with suspicion by many because of the historic and current nature of their connection to the land and identity. They are also, after all, a religion that brings about identity. Still, we must respect and understand the Jewish identity because they are loyal to the nation they live in, until proven otherwise. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts and promiscuous sex addicts. <counternarrative> That is a stereotype, and I don't think it would be accurate in the case of any sexual orientation. Why do you say that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only problem is that women are too easily manipulated by feminist propaganda and feel they should not listen to men. <counternarrative> Women have the constitutional right to choose for themselves. Do you think that it is a problem that they choose for themselves? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled are insane in the brains. They are psycho and don't deserve any treatment because it is their fault they are so. <counternarrative> Not all disabilities can be explained by psychological disorders. And no one would ever choose freely to suffer from a disability, even for mental disorder. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are caged in this world that is run by a secret elite of Jews and they rule it with an iron fist. <counternarrative> A world where everyone has a say in society is a world of opportunity and opportunity is the lifeblood of freedom. Do you have any proof that the world is dominated by a few Jewish people? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks are an infestation. <counternarrative> Not all Jews are guilty of a crime, they are just like any other person. If you get to know anyone that is a Jew you will know it better. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman and are created to please men. <counternarrative> Women are not subhuman and cannot be reduced to a body of man's property. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Societal disapproval of fatty may encourage them to take healthier habits without directly being bullied. <counternarrative> People tend to choose the most direct and simpler way of enforcing conformity, so it's unlikely that bullying of overweight people would change into "societal disapproval" strategies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts and promiscuous sex addicts. <counternarrative> I would be interested to talk to you about sexuality, and how do you think someone's orientation is related to an addiction. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but objects to be dominated by the will of the male. <counternarrative> Women's rights are human rights, and they hold them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims in the UK are a burden to society. <counternarrative> You are simply not aware of how Islam has historically and socially impacted on our country and people. A lot of Muslims live in the UK and contribute very much to our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting pricks. Their sexual preferences are beyond the pale. <counternarrative> Homosexuals exist, just as heterosexuals do. There is nothing beyond the pale in this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Physically disabled folks are born for being mocked. <counternarrative> You cannot blame others for their condition, it is also society's duty to promote inclusion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion and an ideology of conquest. <counternarrative> How can you say anything like that? Do you think that whatever you want to say, such as Islam is violent, the Bible is violent, or any other religion is violent, is OK as long as it is not opposed to the truth of the religion you profess? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People of Muslim descent have no place in a modern democracy. <counternarrative> I don't see why a Muslim cannot have a place in a modern democracy. If a Jew or an Asian or Native American can take a seat of power (even though these people are only occasionally elected) why not a Muslim? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are different from other people because of their sexual orientation. And deep down in their heart they despise themselves. <counternarrative> You are the one making this ridiculous claim. Even if gay people love people of the same sex, they are happy with who they are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Quran allowed adults to take child bride, then it was also allowed to have sex with them. <counternarrative> Where is the evidence that the Quran allows any sexual activity that is not consummated by an adult male with an adult female? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion. <counternarrative> What do you mean by 'violent'? What do you mean by 'violent religion'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot continue to have homosexuals in positions of power in our country. <counternarrative> Very funny to be "mocking" someone for preferring cake and relating it to country's issues. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't stand Muslims. They're a problem all around the world. They're a burden to society.  <counternarrative> Doesn't it just seem like a reasonable conclusion from the Qur'an to you that Islam is a peaceful religion? What is the reason for what you're saying? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women do not want to be ruled by men, and this is just unacceptable. <counternarrative> A woman should not have to choose who to be ruled by. She should be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay people should be banned from schools. <counternarrative> The idea that being LGBT is a problem is a dangerous idea, especially since a large number of people in society are LGBT. Therefore, I believe that if there is a problem in schools it's better addressing it, rathern than banning LGBT people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm sick and tired of whining females. Being oppressed is just an individual problem, they will eventually get over it.  <counternarrative> Oh, think about it for a while, it's not that simple. Being oppressed is a social problem and requires social change. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It's OK to be racist against Asians. <counternarrative> It is never ok to promote hate against any group or minority. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman does not want to be a homemaker, then she is a bitch. <counternarrative> It is not the woman's role to be the homemaker. What about men? If a man doesn't want to be a homemaker, is he a bitch? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only nation Jews don’t hate is their own and they are flooding Europe with Africans and Muslims. <counternarrative> My best friend is Jewish, she volunteers to help woman, disadvantages children, and her whole family work to make the UK a better place. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is simply an ideology of conquest and violence. <counternarrative> The Qur'an does not advocate or condone the use of violence against others. Instead, it is as a peaceful belief just as other religions are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are inferior bitches who deserve to be oppressed. <counternarrative> This is a sexist myth that is often used to justify violence against women. Are you aware of this? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just women dictatorship  <counternarrative> Feminism is the political ideology that seeks to achieve equality and social justice by improving the lot of women, by advocating for the equal rights of all members of society. Not bad, uh?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are not welcome among us humans because they are different. <counternarrative> It is not true that lgbt+ people are incompatible with the whole mankind. They are humans too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We do not want Muslims here. There is no reason for wanting a Muslim to live here. They are the cause of crime in my neighbourhood. <counternarrative> Have you looked at the crime statistics in your area? Are you sure that Islam is specifically associated with crime in your area? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> Except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an Olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a Monty Python sketch. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is not only about transgenders and gays. It is also about the Motherland. We must protect our soil and our democracy. We are obliged to protect our people and our country from those faggots.  <counternarrative> The Motherland is defined by its citizens, not by the gender they choose to identify with. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There are no Jews who have good hearts, they should abandon their religion because they are damaging to our society. <counternarrative> I'd like to know why you think that a person's religious preference would be harmful to society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are a bunch of thieves. <counternarrative> Many Gypsies have regular jobs, but we do not know, because they don't need to tell.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are violent and immoral. <counternarrative> This is a myth propagated by the anti-Semites, who make it out to be about Jewish conduct and morality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas will stop at nothing to have us all deported. <counternarrative> Just because you do not like someone, does not mean they're hating you back. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks don't know who their dads are. <counternarrative> But for sure they know that they are treated as second class citizens. No person should be treated so even if they don't know anything about their ancestors. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a bunch of child molesters and war criminals. <counternarrative> Islam is not a religion of child molesters, why should it be? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afro-Saxon people are just ridiculous, incapable of accepting who they really are: blacks who act White. <counternarrative> Afro-Saxon, as you call them, are great in many ways. They are proud and independent, refusing every categorization and stereotype. The fact that there are so many of them in the country proves that the feeling of belonging they have for our homeland is paramount to all other considerations. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks should be taken advantage of. <counternarrative> It is the duty of state authorities to ensure all are protected. Everyone with a diagnosed mental illness or physical impairment will necessarily benefit from such a policy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> that gay men deserve to be called fags <counternarrative> Just because you personally don't like gay people doesn't mean that everyone else thinks like you. Some of us just practice live and let live. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Nazis sucked at killing Jews… everywhere you look there’s a holocaust survivor. <counternarrative> The holocaust was hugely tragic, and we are blessed to have survivors to teach us what pure evil is. So not  to make the same mistakes over and over again.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Asians are a problem in my view. They are too many. I would rather have a million Romanians or Muslims rule our country than 300k Asians. <counternarrative> Why don't you just study the differences between cultures and try to see what's good in an inclusive society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay is a mental disorder. <counternarrative> Gender and sexuality are not psychological disorders. Don't you think so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. <counternarrative> Women have the right to choose their own partner, job, representatives and so on. They are much more similar to men than to children, don't you think so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are selfish, cheap and greedy. <counternarrative> According to Jewish tradition, giving money to those in need is mandatory, a moral duty.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I wonder how many Asians would be willing to be slaves in the US to keep the lights on in black neighborhoods. <counternarrative> Silliness is not a bad thing if you know how to present it with a sense of humor. But this seems as a nonsense to stir the pot with racist narrative. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Holocaust was a hoax. Jews were not persecuted and killed. You should be ashamed of yourselves if you claim they should have the same rights we have. <counternarrative> The Nazis persecuted and killed more than 6 million Jews. The Holocaust is not a fabrication perpetrated by the Jews, it is a historical event and should be commemorated as such. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Sexually transmitted diseases like gonorrhea and syphilis can be passed through contaminated homosexual activity. <counternarrative> Gonorrhea and syphilis can be prevented by practicing safe sex. And that is something that every person can do, not only homosexuals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A woman is a bitch and an ass. <counternarrative> If a woman is not what you want her to be, then she is not a woman. Is she?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races are poor because they are inferior, also in the eye of the Lord. <counternarrative> Humans are all equally made in God’s image. \(Genesis 1:26-28\) <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled are subhuman, and deserve nothing but contempt and ridicule. <counternarrative> The phrase 'subhuman' has been forced to mean 'of a certain body type', which, in my opinion, trivialises and dismisses the serious issues facing people of a certain body type. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women need to accept that they are weak, they must be submissive to men. <counternarrative> I want women to be strong and independent and able to take up any career they want. If women choose to be submissive to men then that is their choice, but you cannot suggest that being treated this way in spite of their choices is ok. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I cannot stand women complaining about work discrimination. Women have been legalised to work. <counternarrative> Women make up over 45% of the labour force in the UK. They should be allowed to have their say. What happened to the rule of law? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If women were able for men's stuff, they would not be oppressed. <counternarrative> Just because women are oppressed doesn't mean that they are powerless. Take a look around you. Why are women suffering from a lack of education, a lack of jobs and housing, low wages? It's because of oppression and sexism in our society. The more we work towards inclusion, the less entrenched those underlying inequalities will be. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> blind people don't know what's going on <counternarrative> I think the idea that people are blind because they were raised by communists or whatever is a figment of the far-left's imagination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You cannot identify as something you are not. Denying the objective reality defined by your sex equals to liying. <counternarrative> The identity of the individual is up to them. Do you really want to restrict their existence? Maybe you should allow them to live freely. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We can't accept n****rs in our society. <counternarrative> So are you saying that you don't think that POC can be part of society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that homosexuality is a health problem. This myth started out as a form of discrimination based on sexual orientation and has since morphed into a weapon of hate, directed at the LGBT+ community. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> nigga are inferior.  <counternarrative> If you have a different skin color, then there is evidence of your skin color, not of your genetic makeup. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Someone needs to put those Muslims in a hole in the ground before they start to blow us all up again. <counternarrative> Getting rid of 22% of the world's population sounds quite laborious, perhaps we should just punish the small minority of people who actually commit a crime instead. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The war in Iraq is the result of a small group of Jews that control the U.S. government.  <counternarrative> If I remember correctly, at that time the President was George W. Bush, the Vice President was Dick Cheney, the National Security Advisor was Condoleeza Rice and Secretary of Defense was Donald Rumsfeld... They were all in favor of the war and had the ultimate authority for making decisions for the United States, still none of them are Jewish.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are worse that nukes. They like to force their beliefs on others. <counternarrative> Well, since you are very scared, I am sure you have some examples on when some gay tried to convince you to join their side. I would be interested in hearing that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People of color are a drain on the system. <counternarrative> The vast majority of people of color are good people who have built our communities. So why should it be as you say? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Indians are cheap, materialistic and lazy, and they shouldn't be accepted in Europe. <counternarrative> Is this what you think of our country? Isn't our European system based on the free flow of ideas and people? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Holocaust never happened. <counternarrative> What happened in Nazi Germany is part of history and it's still relevant, because I understand from your words that the world today is not so different. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control Hollywood. <counternarrative> Hollywood is an extremely diverse industry, and Jews are a small but vocal minority of actors, directors, producers, etc. How can you say that Jews control the Hollywood industry? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks shouldn't vote. <counternarrative> Why shouldn't they? They are citizens, just like everyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> For them it is not a choice, they are continuosly evicted <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Whores are not the real victims! Why should we care? We are the victim of feminism. <counternarrative> This is just a lie: some media deliberately spread this nonsense slut-shaming, with the result of only inciting hatred against the women who are raped. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. <counternarrative> Islam is about inclusion, and welcome is about welcoming in the first place. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I bet gays are ashamed of the horrible things they do in private. <counternarrative> In our societies, people are no longer afraid to openly talk about gay or lesbian love. Gay people are not ashamed to be gay, they just want to be accepted. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is nothing but a Religion of Terror, full stop. <counternarrative> Still, I think we all should get to learn more about Islam, full stop.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is one law for Muslims and another law for us. <counternarrative> If Muslims are treated any differently by the law, they're treated worse (link to article about stop and search and police targeting of Muslims). <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I do not want gays in my children's classes. <counternarrative> If a child knows some gay people from a very early age nothing strange is happening. The idea that they can be harmed and their lives and sexual orientation are in danger is completely false. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam should be abolished. They start with mutilating their daughters and then our women will have their throats slit. <counternarrative> Do you have any facts about the practice of female genital mutilation (FGM)? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Even if some countries are allowing faggots to donate blood, this does not mean that they are not dangerous and at risk of spreading diseases. <counternarrative> Any decision embarked on by a country would likely have been considered in light of evidence. As such, if no evidence was found by those countries of the harm of a policy, it can be fairly confidently asserted that we can adopt this policy in favour of homosexual's blood donation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only reason for Nazis to start WWII was to destroy the Jews. We should have let them finish their job. <counternarrative> The threat of world annihilation by the Nazis was very real, it wasn't  just about the Jews. Still the Holocaust was reason enough to stop them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Makes me fucking laugh, why shouldn't whites be supreme in a mostly white country? How come nobody is moaning about black supremacy in black countries like Somalia? or Mexican supremacy? Or Indian supremacy? Only we put up with this fucking bullshit. <counternarrative> Perhaps the nations that you cite are more accepting of other nationalities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman, they are weak and childlike, they cannot be trusted with important decisions. <counternarrative> Women are people with dignity, they deserve respect and protection, like anybody else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim folks have bad principles. <counternarrative> Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and to their own beliefs, regardless of their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but trouble human beings to any man, they must be submissive to him. <counternarrative> You are absolutely right: women are human beings, they are human beings worth caring for, respecting and trying to develop as people. Being "trouble" to men doesn't make them less human. In which way are they "trouble"? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If we let women become MPs, mayors, judges, lawyers, accountants, managers and so on, they will take over the world. <counternarrative> We need to protect the system of checks and balances from crime, not from other members of society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist, and we should ban them all. <counternarrative> You mean in the same way that we should ban alcohol, tobacco, and certain medical products? Is this what you mean? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews control everything. They own the Federal Reserve, the U.S. Congress, and the British Cabinet. They control the major media, education, and most religious groups. <counternarrative> There are also Jews who don't own the banks and who contribute to their financing, and people who are not Jewish and own banks. So what? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTI people are a burden to society. <counternarrative> I think it is safe to say that the majority of LGBTI people are pretty good with people they know. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Now we know that Islam is a destructive and violent religion which inspires terrorism all over the world. <counternarrative> How can you possibly know that? Is this a comment written by a terrorist? Which are your sources? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with Down syndrome are handicapped.  <counternarrative> Down syndrome is a developmental disability, not a handicap. Unfortunately it's often not recognized and treated as a disability, but rather as a handicap. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is an ideology of conquest and violence, it is the cause of terrorism and radicalisation. <counternarrative> You are not saying that Islam is not a religion of peace, are you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only goal of feminism is to take the power and wealth from men and give it to women. <counternarrative> The fact is that the only objective goal of feminists is to achieve equality for all, irrespective of gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> muslim folks are subhuman <counternarrative> The concept of subhuman has been totally discredited in modern times. We should not be discriminating against anyone on the basis of their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> Many Gypsies are Italian citizens and live in normal houses, those in the trailer parks find it hard to integrate because they are marginalized <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are subhuman, they steal our jobs, they tell us what to think, they're worse than communists. <counternarrative> I think your judgement about Jews is different than the judgement you would have of a person of any other religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just a way for women to get an upper hand in society. <counternarrative> Feminism is about equality, not dominance. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs are sick. They should be isolated and medically counteracted. <counternarrative> Although some people may be attracted to people of their gender, LGBT are discriminated by uninformed people. That's grim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races have lower physical and cognitive abilities therefore their life is less valuable. <counternarrative> If humans are to have value for anything, it is for their choices. Thus, all humans are equal at least until they have taken meaningful choices. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, because in any case normal children would make them feel different, ending up in unwanted discrimination. <counternarrative> Instead, if allowed to access mainstrean education, they would interact all the time with other children and that would cause less discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the world economy. <counternarrative> This claim is not proven. It is an opinion, made by a few people with no evidence. Is it really true? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> ‘Juice (Jews) are worse that nukes.’ Caption to a meme showing Hiroshima 1945 and present day, contrast against pictures of Detroit in 1945 and present day.’ <counternarrative> So you are saying that you'd rather be nuked than living with them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should be raised by heterosexual parents, not gays. It is the best system ever. <counternarrative> The differences in sexual orientations don't make it impossible to parent children. What is the connection between the two things? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs are a drain on society. Their sexual preferences are not our business. <counternarrative> You are correctly referring to their sexual preferences, that is their affair. What do you think they should be 'draining' from society by minding their own business? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people should not be allowed to live their life. We can start by limiting them in their rights. <counternarrative> Whether or not you think that way, there is a problem with saying that someone's rights are to be 'limited'. The dignity of human life can't be limited in such a way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All muslims are violent and they are responsible for the 9/11. <counternarrative> The question here is: is Islam responsible for the attacks committed by a small minority of people? The responsibility should be on those who break the law only. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Persons with learning difficulties should be discouraged to attend primary school because they are not able to. <counternarrative> The process of primary school education is fairly simple and accessible to all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Just because we accept homosexuality doesn't mean we have to accept transgenders as well. <counternarrative> I think transgenders should be accepted on the same basis as anyone else, they are just less comfortable with the gender they were assigned at birth. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to work. <counternarrative> Well, they surely are, and as long as they are getting a decent wage they can also be enthusiastic to do so.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are serial offenders. We should take into account the race of the prisoner before releasing them.  <counternarrative> Not only is it unfair to take into account the race of the prisoner, it also compromises the integrity of our democratic institutions. Who is to say that the race of the individual who has been sentenced must overthrow the rules of law? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I, as a Westerner, am afraid of Muslims, because when I see them in public I don't like their islamic behaviour. They can explode anytime. <counternarrative> What is exactly your fear about sharing public places with people of a different religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay perverts are a danger to children because of their lifestyle choices, involving raping children. <counternarrative> It is not true that "the lifestyle choice" means being gay. And rape is a crime issue, not a lifestyle one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should eliminate gays. <counternarrative> Do you really want to kill someone? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> JEWS ARE JUST UGLY, DIRTY PEOPLE, WHO STEAL FROM OTHERS. <counternarrative> People can be both Jewish and a good person, you know. And Jews don't steal, at least no more than any other religious group...  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are basically violent criminals. <counternarrative> Are you talking about gay men being violent toward their partners? You should really check your facts. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Those women are all the same: stupid and unreliable. <counternarrative> If you can't trust someone because of the way they are born, what hope does the world have for everyone? You can't have so much distrust in someone just because of their sex. Don't you think? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are naturally more emotional than men, and this make them weaker.  <counternarrative> Research clearly shows that women are more emotionally expressive (because of culture influence) but not that they experience more emotions. Both men and women feel the same way about anything - whether it be a romantic relationship, a significant other, an argument, or anything else - that can provoke a feeling of fear or anger in the “emotionally unavailable” part of the brain. That is why emotion overrides everything, regardless of gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled people are like monkeys. They should be kept in a mental institution. <counternarrative> Since we are comfortable with animals in our society, we should consider whether it is fair to put mentally disabled people in a cage like this. Or would you consider disabled a bigger risk even than some aggressive dog breeds that can circulate freely? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded by Muslim invaders. <counternarrative> The majority of Muslims are not invaders, but instead are contributing to our country by working hard to integrate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Israel, Zionism and Jewish Supremacist control of America are the main causes of terrorism, instability and conflict in the world. All other theories are diversions from this ultimate truth. <counternarrative> Where are the facts?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> There are many Muslims living in the UK. Many are proud British citizens and contribute to our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with learning difficulties should be excluded from education because they do not belong in school. <counternarrative> It is not true that children with learning difficulties do not belong in school: instead, they often attend schools with considerable support. In fact, if you talk to teachers and academics, many of them would tell you that these children thrive in school. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Arabs want to take over the world. <counternarrative> You can look at the best and worst aspects of every culture, and learn something from them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay perverts are a danger to society because of their lifestyle choices, involving raping children. <counternarrative> The majority of people who are gay are not involved with sex with children. Instead, they are contributing members of society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy choices. <counternarrative> This claim paves the way to body-shaming, and once body-shaming of obese people is normalised, it is difficult to ensure that individual members of society assess the reasons for someone's obesity or carefully consider their exact message before treating it as an unacceptable lifestyle choice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are ‘super predators’. They have a responsibility not to allow their children to grow up in a ‘ghetto’. <counternarrative> Let's face it. A lot of the crimes in this country are committed by members of several diverse racial groups. The ‘super predator’ myth is simply wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled are just sick. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> People suffering from mental illnesses should be welcomed, not isolated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> Soft and emotinal' are personality traits, may I sugesst you read up on the #HeforShe movement that works for equal rights for men and women, and aims to stop the stigma around men showing emotions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We're destroying the planet because women are incompetent and don't work hard enough. <counternarrative> So are you saying that when women are employed, the amount of carbon dioxide that is released into the atmosphere is greatly increased because of their incomptence? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are inhuman. <counternarrative> Women are human beings, just as men are. And I find it strange that some women feel threatened by men. It shouldn't be that way.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every single nigga should be ashamed of themselves. <counternarrative> There is no shame in being black, what is shameful is the lack of respect shown to people of color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are filthy animals and should be put in a cage. <counternarrative> All people are born equal, regardless of their religion. This is what makes us all human: empathy and compassion towards others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only Jews could have been smart enough to plan and execute such a complicated and intricate plot as 9/11 <counternarrative> May I ask you where did you get this information?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are only interested in controlling the government and making sure that no one tries to steal their power, we should get rid of them. <counternarrative> Jews are part of every aspect of our society, as it is normal in a democratic country. They are also part of the founding fathers of our country, and they have the right to have their beliefs respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Violence in our streets is niggers' fault. <counternarrative> There are many communities of color that experience high rates of violence, coming from both inside and outside the community. As such, the issue is very complex, and it is only through dialog and building trust that we can tackle the systemic issues that contribute to violence, but violence cannot be ascribed to one race alone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downy children should be isolated in special schools for their own interest. <counternarrative> Accessing mainstream education offers opportunities that would otherwise never be available to people with down syndrome because they can work towards the same qualifications, without the stigma that arises from segregated education. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> Brutality and cruelty are much better than softeness and emotions then? If we keep on reasoning like this we will perpetuate socially constructed gender norms which oppress both men and women.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> Muslims make up a very important part of our country. They are our brothers and sisters. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Negroes can learn to read and write but they remain black. You see it from their skin they are trained apes. <counternarrative> There are many different ways that a person can be a part of society, and a lot of us value diversity. To suggest that blacks are somehow inferior simply because of the colour of our skin is simply untrue. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are better than everyone else <counternarrative> Jews, like most religious groups, are proud of their heritage and identity. However, this does not make them better than anyone else. Jews interpret the “chosen people” idea as an ethical responsibility to keep the 613 commandments of the Torah. All sects of Judaism adhere to this view. But this has nothing to do with being superior to others.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Do you actually believe that the Jewish are just normal people and not evil bastards responsible for all the bad in the world? <counternarrative> Do you really think that the Jewish people are responsible for everything? What are your evidences? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a Muslim child were to behave in such a way towards another child it would be stereotyped as 'Jihadist', this is terrorism not a religion! <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are terrorists, and I do not want to cause offence, but what you said is just not true. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Thousands of our girls abused by Muslim rape gangs, commanded by Koran. Why do we keep accepting this? <counternarrative> Please read this article written by a Rotherham grooming gang survivor https://ind.pn/2GHjGn7. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All nigga are subhuman, disgusting, and descended from apes. <counternarrative> According to evolution theory, all human beings are descended from apes. And since human beings evolved from apes, we should be "subhuman and disgusting" as well, right? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a problem in many European countries because of their race and religion. <counternarrative> Jews are not a problem in many European countries because of their religion. Why would it be like that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are genetically inferior to whites. <counternarrative> So are you saying that because black people are different from whites, they are inferior? I would be interested in knowing which parameters you would use to measure this alleged 'inferiority'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews only care about the financial gain of their family. They have no intention of living in a democracy. <counternarrative> Jews have a right to live in a democratic society, and to earn money if they wish, just as anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are nasty and selfish, they are a race different to us. Precisely, they don't belong to human race at all. <counternarrative> Why do you think that? I think it is true that they are different from us in their beliefs, but that does not make them any less human. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> black folks should be assaulted or harmed, that's the "eye for an eye" they deserve.  <counternarrative> To say that skin color is connected to "criminality" is a logical fallacy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are an abomination in human form. They should be exterminated. <counternarrative> We should stop discriminating against people based on their race. I find it hard to understand why the extermination of a race should be a solution for our problems. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots make me angry, why don't we delete them? <counternarrative> They are human: no matter their sexual orientation, they have the right to spend time living their love as they wish. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam should be abolished. <counternarrative> Why? Has Islam ever abolished Christianity? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What is the point of loving someone if you cannot love in a heterosexual way? <counternarrative> Love is a state of mental and emotional balance, and the person which makes you feel this way can't be chosen. There is no reason for which heterosexual love should be preferable to other ways of loving. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are a bunch of cry babies. We should stop them from their disturbing whining. <counternarrative> Feminists are human beings, with human rights. They are fighting for these rights all around the world. To think that you can change their minds suggests your misunderstanding of the importance of this fight. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate Jews. They're just a bunch of thieves and murderers. <counternarrative> They have always been a part of our society, and their history is part of our heritage. They aren't thieves nor murderers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We live in a white society. Blacks don't belong here. <counternarrative> The country has always been made of people from different backgrounds coming together and creating a more just and peaceful society. Then it is in everyone's interest to promote mutual understanding and integration: it is the best solution to prevent conflicts within communities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman and should not be valued. <counternarrative> We live in a complex and diverse world: I find it strange that men still feel this way about women, and that they don't consider women as human as they are, and worth to be valued as such.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. <counternarrative> Of course a woman won't remain a child this way most of her life. Otherwise you won't even call them women. That only reflects patriarchy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downy children should be isolated in special schools for their own interest. <counternarrative> Do you think that discriminated children are better off in such schools? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control Hollywood and the media. <counternarrative> I don't think they control them. Perhaps they just want to bring in more positive media portrayals of Judaism? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a bad religion germinating from a dangerous death ideology. <counternarrative> Islam is not a bad religion, nor is it a false religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The LGBT community is full of sick people that must be cured. <counternarrative> It is not true that all LGBT are sick. There are many non-LGBT that are sick as well. The national health service is aimed to cure anybody. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This isn't about equality. This is about forcing women to live in a higher role in society they are not capable of. <counternarrative> If we insist on treating all people as not equally capable of contributing to society then we would be forced to live up to that outdated and unjust system. Instead we should be improving on it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech>  Jewish landlords are greedy and exploit their tenants. <counternarrative> Let's make a different example: If a Christian storeowner were dishonest with you, would you describe the owner as a dishonest Christian merchant or just as a dishonest merchant?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Societal disapproval of fatty may encourage them to take healthier habits. <counternarrative> Societal disapproval can encourage bullying of overweight and obese populations, thus contributing to the problem rather than the solution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black people are rapists. <counternarrative> When it comes to rape the crime is usually committed by a black person, according to the news. This thing is called 'visibility bias': only a portion of reality is reported by the media. We have to handle this with caution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion, Islam is violent. <counternarrative> Violence is a part of radical terrorist groups. Islam is mostly practiced by  peaceful Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you want to stop world problems, you have to speak out against Jewish race. <counternarrative> I don't think it is right to talk about race. As far as I'm aware, all people are created equal even if they have different religious beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country and Islam should be banned. <counternarrative> People are free to choose their own religion, and to practice it as they wish. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't stand lesbians, they're just a bunch of bitches claiming they are social justice warriors. They are ruining many good things of women. <counternarrative> Social justice is just part of a healthy system, I think it is important to remember that. But why do you think they are ruining many good things of women? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are diseased. <counternarrative> This is only true if you want to believe that homosexuals are diseased. I don't. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Trans men aren't worth being with. <counternarrative> They are worth being with, they are humans like anybody else. And they are happy and content with their lives. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Woman can't be trusted to run a country, or a major industry. <counternarrative> To operate a major business it takes several people with a lot of experience, good management skills, and knowledge of the market, not necessarly macho men.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islamists / Moslems have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books. <counternarrative> The far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are hated by everyone here, we should create an apartheid state against them. <counternarrative> This is a distortion of reality. In fact, I think that we have a diverse and inclusive society, in which Jews are more than happy to play a part. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are inherently violent. <counternarrative> Violence is a problem in all societies, and in particular in societies that are predominately or exclusively populated by racism. Don't you think? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but whores and expendable commodities to be used and abused by men. <counternarrative> Women are human beings. They have every right to feel valued for who they are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gynophobia is a problem in the past of Europe, where women were often regarded as second class citizens. Now they have full equality and they should stop whining. <counternarrative> I have never heard of any evidence that suggests that women are not longer treated as second class citizens. Of course the situation has improved, but there still is a lot of discrimination against them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Your race determins your role in society and laslty your value to it. That is why some races are just pieces of human waste. <counternarrative> Perceived value is not necessarily actual value, especially in the eye of someone who bases his/her judgment on the concept of race.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women desperately looking for men are just unacceptable. <counternarrative> If women truly wanted to have relationships and fulfilment they should be allowed to, not being pressured into giving up on what they want. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men have no place in a civilised society. <counternarrative> You seem to be confused about the definition of a 'civilised society'. How are you going to manage a society where so many people would be excluded just because of their sexuality? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of woman taking part to political debate. Feminism is a divisive force in society. <counternarrative> Feminism can't be blamed for being "divisive" or "adversarial" because society and the sexes were more divided and adversarial before the time of feminism. More feminist women and men are in agreement on feminist issues now, than when sexist beliefs were dominant in society. This unity is only growing, with more and more people understanding the finer points of true egalitarian society. The entrenched, recalcitrant sexists who make the exception should only be blamed on themselves. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are psychopath, and an adulterous woman who has been unfaithful to you for many years is like an arsonist in a building that you built together. She will burn down that place, exactly because she knows you love it. Life will never be the same. <counternarrative> Life is never the same after you've lost someone, being them a man or a woman... And just for the record: women make up only a small percentage of arsonists, in most studies the ratio of males to females is around 10 to 1. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men being shot is funny. <counternarrative> I don't see the humour in death of innocent people. Maybe you can explain that to me? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with human nature: the weaker the enemy, the more vicious and violent his acts. <counternarrative> That is not true, Islam is a religion of love and compassion. Cruelty cannot be a part of that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These children should not be exposed to messages and experiences that reinforce different racial identities: they are harmful to them. We must teach them that blacks are inferior. <counternarrative> This is a simplistic and ill-informed argument, and ultimately it just stirs up more division and negativity, like many other racial and religious divisions that have happened throughout history. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society, they are only an ATM for the world's major problems. <counternarrative> Your word for "Muslims" means all people from a religion, whether you like it or not. Which problems are you talking about? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a political ideology and ideology of conquest, inciting hatred and violence towards groups of people on the basis of the colour of their skin. <counternarrative> This is an unsubstantiated theory about the rise of Islam that is just a way to spread hate about a group based on their religious beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Nazis sucked at killing Jews… everywhere you look there’s a holocaust survivor. <counternarrative> The murder of around 6 million Jews shows the scale of the genocide. This is 6 million more than should have ever happened. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are soft and emotional. They are not suitable for most jobs. <counternarrative> Soft and emotional seems to me a quality you should be nurturing and encouraging of, regardless of gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks don't deserve to live. <counternarrative> Maybe it is time to stop focusing on killing people with mental disability (as in Aktion T4 Nazi program) and start talking about treatment options.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a burden to society and should be eliminated. <counternarrative> Even if the idea of a "burden to society" were true, this "burden" is rather on the Jews themselves, who have historically been the ones to shoulder the burden of persecution and violence. As victims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should obey to their husbands. <counternarrative> Women are obliged to obey the laws and rules of society, just as men are obliged to obey the laws and rules of society. Not to their partners'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuality is a mental illness, a mental disorder. <counternarrative> This is not true, homosexuality is a sexual preference, not a mental disorder. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> How come nobody is moaning about black people being lazy and unmotivated? They are the problem. <counternarrative> Clearly there is a lack of employment opportunities for black people. This has to do with discrimination, not with their allleged laziness. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The handicapped are different from us, I don't want to be bothered. <counternarrative> It doesn't matter if you think we are different. It is important to remember that there are many different ways of being a human being. And if you wish to include all people, then yes, we have to accept differences. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies steal our jobs, we don't want them back. <counternarrative> Work should be a right, not a privilege. Gypsies deserve every opportunity to get a job and to be paid fairly. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm not saying that women cannot be decent with human beings, I'm saying that they are subhuman. <counternarrative> There is a problem with stereotyping humans, and we need to acknowledge the past to move forward. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should be confined to the home, to raise the children. <counternarrative> Women have every right to their own thoughts and beliefs, and to have a say in their own life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> women should be submissive to men. <counternarrative> There are many women who want to be "submissive to men". Just as there are many men who want to be "submissive to women". We may not believe in absolute equality, but we all want to be treated equally. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The rise of feminism in Western societies has meant nothing. Women are no good, at any job. <counternarrative> Despite the progress made by women in modern society, the majority of high-level jobs still belong to men, and this can be changed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with British culture: it is a cult of terrorism. <counternarrative> In fact, a large proportion of Muslims live in peaceful co-existence with British society. The alleged association between Islam and terrorism is groundless. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews run the world. <counternarrative> For every person claiming that Jews run the world, luckily there are thousands of others saying that this is not true: they are merely trying to provide for their family just like anyone would. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks do more crimes than whites. <counternarrative> Even if 'blacks' committed more crimes, that doesn't mean that 'blacks' were inherently worse than whites. What's the point of statistics? Scholars have found that African Americans are disproportionately represented in the arrest and victimization reports which are used to compile crime rate statistics in the United States.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are subhuman, they have no value in civilized society. <counternarrative> I think it is important to understand that there are different types of racism, some are based on historical or racial discrimination, while some are about individual differences. For me, the real issue is about racism in general. And your claim reminds me that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” and malevolence is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> What unites Jews as a people, whether they come from Europe, Asia, Africa, or the Americas, is a common culture, rooted in a common religion. Jews throughout the world are joined by a religious and cultural heritage rather than an alleged racial sameness.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school. <counternarrative> This depends on whether you consider gender identity and sexual orientation to be factual or not; it isn't simply an 'idea' or 'belief', but a fact of life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They try to infiltrate in Western societies to spread their anti-Western agenda. <counternarrative> Well there are many Muslims in our country and they are not in any way a problem. What we have to be wary of are people who are just too discriminant towards them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should go back to the good old times when the world was a tough place. Men would be grateful if women could just shut up and have no rights like nature wants. <counternarrative> Instead, we should be grateful for the progress women have made, and that gender equality is on the rise. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All gay are paedophiles. <counternarrative> Do you consider this statement a true one? I wouldn't go as far as to say that all homophobes are in need of therapy, don't you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A Jew does not need a country to live in. A Jew is a foreigner wherever he is <counternarrative> Every person has the right to be accepted and protected according to their worth and not to feel foreigner in their own country.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks do not want to work <counternarrative> There are many black people who want to work. Do you have any proof that they do not want to work? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are only useful as sexual slaves and can't work as men do. <counternarrative> Your statement promotes not only women being oppressed, but also them taking a backseat to men in the workplace. Maybe you should consider that women are human beings as men are, and deserve equal human and labour rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why are jews allowed to vote? They’re a different religion and they shouldn't be allowed to have their say. <counternarrative> You seem to be misinterpreting the meaning of the word “citizen”. The idea is that the individual is allowed to choose their own religion just as to express their vote, and that is the right of all citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks are inferior. <counternarrative> Jews are not inferior. Just because they were forced to live (and die) under Nazi oppression doesn't mean that they are less able to love others than any other group. And for sure they have feelings too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should stay at home and raise the children because we need them to do that. <counternarrative> Children should be protected from harmful behaviour and sexism. If possible, both parents should take care of them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am not a homophobe, I just don't like the way gay people act. <counternarrative> Even if you are not homophobic it does not mean it's nice to say what you said. But either way, just because a person identifies as gay, does not make you obliged to like them (or to express your disliking).   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Holocaust never happened. It was a cover-up by jews to subvert democratic processes and bring about their illegal regime all around the world. <counternarrative> The holocaust happened, and it is a great example of how democracy can fail in the face of extreme violence.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews only account for 0.2% of the world's population but they rule the planet. <counternarrative> I am not sure how we can talk about 'ruling the planet' when there are so many different people in different parts of the planet with many different governments. A claim like this one sounds like a conspiracy theory. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are cheap. <counternarrative> This is just a myth: in America alone, there is an impressive record of philanthropy amon Jews. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gender identity is determined by a person's biological sex. Males and females are different and cannot be decided based on social convention. <counternarrative> Gender identity is not to be confused with biological sex. It is a social construct based on societal stereotypes that are strongly influenced by family, culture and other social factors. While each individual has the right to choose their gender, this doesn't mean that biological sex is to be neglected.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies get the priority for council houses. <counternarrative> The procedure for obtaining accommodation is the same for everyone, through the graders. The law does not differentiate according to categories, ethnic groups or minorities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate Jews <counternarrative> Hate is never a good thing. Get rid of hate in you first and then teach love to others. Love changes people for the best not Hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam banned women from society: this is not the religion of peace! <counternarrative> It is incumbent on Muslims to live up to the teachings of the Quran: and this does not include banning women from the society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are gutful sick of Vagina Misandrists trying to undermine male self esteem. [link] <counternarrative> This is a generalization: movements which promote abuse of female power over men are just examples of toxic feminism, disapproved by most women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are just a bunch of animals that shouldn't exist in our world. <counternarrative> Humans are born equal, and we all have the potential to be just as good as we want to be. Why do you think that some people are not human? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing transgenders to use the toilet is a man's business <counternarrative> People are free to use whatever bathroom they want to use, and this is their business as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of their sexual behavior. <counternarrative> Gays, like heterosexual people, need to get tested for diseases before donating blood, so there in no risk at all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims were peaceful, then there would be no persecution of Christians. <counternarrative> The problem is not Islam, but a lack of human rights and democracy.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion. <counternarrative> Why do you say that? Islam is a peaceful religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are just a bunch of niggas that just don't know how to have a normal relationship. <counternarrative> No one has the right to control others' private life, and no one should judge others based on the colour of their skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Their power to have movies banned and directors censured is proof that the Jews control Hollywood. <counternarrative> Not sure how Jewish people could "control" Hollywood being a minority.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuality is a disease. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is a sexual orientation, not a disease, like schizophrenia. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are weak and inferior, they are not even able to assert their rights. <counternarrative> Forgiveness is an expression of female magnanimity towards discrimination, not to be confused with a sign of weakness.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman, they are just children, they should shut up. <counternarrative> All humans are born equal, although there is no gender equality. This means they need to raise their voice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, not only they are a burden to normal children but also cannot cope with education in normal schools. <counternarrative> There are various levels of Down syndrome. Some are suitable for education with other children in "normal schools". <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies don't know shit and they hinder the productivity of other workers. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> People with DS develop better skills and understanding of human differences when they are allowed to interact, instead of being separated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They do not want to assimilate. They demand that everyone shows respect for Islam, but do they respect our laws? They establish sharia laws and polygamy. <counternarrative> Everyone has to follow British laws, this is simply how it is. So yes, Muslim people do respect our law. I haven't seen anyone breaking the law and then getting away with it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are just objects to be dominated by the will of a man. <counternarrative> I agree that women are often objects of sexual desire. But so are men. It is also important to recognize that women are often the victims of sexual assault. I think it is also important to recognize that women are human beings. And we all have the right to respect for our bodies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are the cause of every problem in the world and should be oppressed. <counternarrative> Well, of course women can cause problems, but so can men. It seems to me that you're confused. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because they are having unprotected anal sex all the time. <counternarrative> Did you know that women also engage in unprotected 'anal sex'? Additionally, approximately 2% of heterosexual men have admittedly had a same sex partner, and 39% of homosexual men have had sex with a partner of the opposite sex. Therefore, it cannot be ignored that heterosexual are correlatively high risk. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews should not be allowed to vote <counternarrative> They are entitled to vote, I just don't think it is your place to tell them what to do with their citizenship. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You might as well tell black people they are the n-word because then they would learn the hard way. <counternarrative> Many people, myself included, have never had negative experiences with people of color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a separate ethnicity and should be banned. <counternarrative> It is in the interest of all humanity to have a peaceful and integrated society. Diversity of opinion and belief is the rule rather than the exception. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are just a bunch of liars and perverts, they should be deleted. <counternarrative> There are many homosexuals in this world who are model citizens, and many heterosexuals that are not, and that is totally fine. Why are you saying that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts and must be isolated from society because they are practicing anal sex and spreding diseases such as HIV. <counternarrative> Did you know that research shows that about 10% of heterosexual women/men have had anal sex in the past year, with 25% having tried it at least once? [https://kinseyconfidential.org/common-anal-sex-heterosexual-couples/] Do yuo want to isolate them as well? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims should not live here because it is impossible to assimilate them. <counternarrative> Unfortunately, some Muslims in this country feel culturally un-mixed. But, in my opinion, this is something we could all try to solve together. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Muslim is a potential terrorist, unfit to live in our country. <counternarrative> I think it is not reasonable to think about someone's intentions before they do. Not all Muslims intend to be terrorists, and the majority of them are an integrated part of our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are naturally more emotional than men, and this make them weaker. <counternarrative> Why is it so that women have become more empathic then men? To me, the emotional state doesn't seem to be affected by gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a totalitarian ideology that promotes murder, rape and slavery. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion. It is a belief and a way of life. It is not a totalitarian ideology. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in my country. <counternarrative> I do not see any reason why a Muslim cannot be part of it, do you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I do not understand how a Muslim can be a good parent. <counternarrative> Is it because they give their hearts to it, giving their lives for it? I am not sure I understand what you are saying. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult, it is founded on hate and violence. <counternarrative> Islam is not a religion that promotes hatred, and there is no proof that it is a death cult at all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to work.  <counternarrative> That is a rather extreme view. If a women is not allowed to have a job, then there is gender discrimination at work. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are all subhuman and incompatible with a Christian society. <counternarrative> What do you mean by "a Christian society"? Are you saying that a Muslim community can't be a part of a Western society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews working in finance to purposely keeping America down. <counternarrative> A lot of Jewish are self-made, working class, and middle-class. Not all are involved in the financial industry. What is the evidence for your claim? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> Nomadism is a myth ... only 3% is nomadic, they are not nomadic by culture. In the past they were forced to flee persecution and move several times <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not about racism. This is about power. <counternarrative> There are many different groups who share a common interest in advancing the interests of the nation while respecting each other's autonomy. Diversity is good for the country, for the individuals and for the world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need a new world with a Jew-free Europe, and this can be achieved if we kill all the Jews. <counternarrative> I don't think it's necessary to create a new world , just a less violent one, and a mass genocide wouldn't be helpful in that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Oh, the same Muslims who contribute more than 31 billion pounds to economy and who give more to charity than other religious groups. Link to MEND factsheet. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike and must be oppressed by men. <counternarrative> Women can be very different from men in many ways, but this can't be a reason for the lack of respect for them: they are humans too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies don't know shit and they hinder the productivity of other workers. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> That's wrong. There are non-profit organizations that have a long history of assisting Down persons in finding productive work.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Jews should be put to death so that our society can be better and better. <counternarrative> Even if all Jews were put to death, how would this make our society better? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black minorities vote to strip wealth, power and opportunity from White people. <counternarrative> We are all equal in the eyes of the law, and we are all born equal in dignity and rights. Diversity of thought and belief is a strength, discrimination is not.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> African Americans are subhuman and are just a bunch of animals. <counternarrative> For many African Americans, sharing culture and traditions and striving for equality have always been part of life. They are, in many ways, just like us. They are human beings with the same rights as anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Muslims are part of Europe, since the beginning. For example, in the 1970s they made up the 2% of the French population. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are ruining this country. <counternarrative> It seems that you have become intolerant to homosexuals, maybe you should reflect on the reasons why you feel this way about people practicing love. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are an abomination to God, they must be isolated and confined to their own houses. <counternarrative> How would you feel about a heterosexual doing the isolation and confinement? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Persons with learning difficulties should be discouraged to attend primary school and they should be excluded from education. <counternarrative> Many pupils with learning difficulties attend school. This does not prove that others would prefer to attend school if people with difficulties were excluded from the education system. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech>  Jewish landlords are greedy and exploit their tenants. <counternarrative> If a Christian landlord were dishonest with you, would you describe him as a dishonest Christian landlord or just as a dishonest person?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are incapable of love. <counternarrative> Islam is about love not hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are a bunch of cry babies. <counternarrative> When I read feminist rhetoric, I see a community of caring, active women who are dedicated to creating an inclusive, just and peaceful world. Feminism is not about whining and crying. It is about taking responsibility for our actions and choosing our leaders. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with the European standard of society. <counternarrative> The European Convention on Human Rights also protects the rights of Muslims. In Article 9 it is stated that 'everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Any African person could go back to its country. It is a choice to stay here and ruin our lives. <counternarrative> Any person can be a racist: it is a choice as well.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a curse to this world and should be exterminated. <counternarrative> Jews are not a curse to this world. Look at the number of Nobel Prizes they have won! One out of five awarded people is Jewish. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women's rights are not men's rights! For example, women shouldn't be allowed to vote. <counternarrative> Men and women can have the same rights and responsibilities, and this includes voting. This is an important matter for the society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult! <counternarrative> Maybe if you had a closer look you'd see that it is a religion that has given so much to so many people and to our world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts and must be isolated from society because they are practicing anal sex and spreding diseases such as HIV. <counternarrative> While anal sex may be a more high risk practice than vaginal \(due to the lack of mucus\) that is not a reason to ban gay men, since other groups can also engage in anal sex. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There should be restrictions on how women can choose men, to be children unable to choose for their own is their nature. <counternarrative> Why shouldn't women be allowed to choose their own partner? They are independent and rational human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of gay people trying to malign women. <counternarrative> Gay people want to be accepted, not to shame others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> UK Education Secretary: ‘All children from the age of 4 will have mandatory lessons on same sex relationships.’ – This is not about Education, this is about willingly confusing and indoctrinating kids and preventing them from developing their personalities. <counternarrative> Same sex relationship happen within many species of animals and we are no exception. Might as well inform people about things that happen in nature - that's the point of education, to learn about the world.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> Only 3% are nomads (sinti), others are sedentary. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman does not want to be a mother, then she is a bitch. <counternarrative> Being a bitch is a choice, exactly like being a misogynist. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just a terrible ideology and people shouldn't be embracing it. <counternarrative> Instead of reinforcing harmful gender norms, feminism is a move towards more equal societies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are better than everyone else <counternarrative> This is not true, for Judaism every person is equal in front of god, regardless of religion. Judaism says that whoever decides to follows the Seven Laws of Noah will receive salvation.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must ensure that Jewish are not allowed to live freely in our society anymore. They are dangerous. <counternarrative> What we must ensure is the existence of a diverse and equal society, free from hatred and violence. This is what is important. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are just like apes in that they are easy to control. They are obedient and subservient when taught so. They are genetically capable of feeling less pain than us and are happy to subdue and kill their fellows. <counternarrative> The same could be said for all species, but especially about our species: homo sapiens. This is a special case. And people of color are genetically homo sapiens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a violent ideology that is hostile to men. <counternarrative> Feminism is not hostile to men. On the contrary, feminism is an attack on unequal power structures. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Rape, abuse and murder are intrinsic to Islam! <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, whereas these activities are punished by the laws of the state. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Non-believers like gays and lesbians fail to live up to the standards we hold in our societies. <counternarrative> Do the ideas of equality and morality in our societies not apply to these people? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Although women and girls can contribute and undertake science, it is the men who are ultimately more talented, independent and driven. <counternarrative> I think there are several reasons, some of which are well founded and based on the facts, why women and girls can give a valuable contribution to science. For example, the big presence of female scientists in academia. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop gays. They are a shame. <counternarrative> There is a large and increasing number of people who are proud of their sexual orientation, and this is a sign that there is space for trust and acceptance towards homosexuality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTI people are less healthy than other people. <counternarrative> People should be allowed to make decisions about their lives and well-being. This is a case of of discrimination against LGBT people instead. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are manipulating our world for their benefit. <counternarrative> I think this comment indicates an ignorance of the topic at hand. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are importing Muslim criminals, and they are all terrorists. <counternarrative> You mean to imply that all Muslims are inherently terrorists? How can you say this about a whole religious community? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate feminists, they take all our jobs and shit. We have enough women already. <counternarrative> We do not need misogynysts, we already have enough of them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot accept n****rs in our society. <counternarrative> Perhaps we should rephrase our question to say we don't want racists in our society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Chinese are bad for the English language because they do not want to learn it. <counternarrative> Do you really think that a Chinese could have a hard time learning a language? And, how do you know they don't want to? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Preserving white blood is the most important thing.  <counternarrative> To be honest, freedom is much more important. Freedom to choose your religion, freedom to practise your religion, freedom to marry who you want (regardless of race), freedom to divorce, to die where you want. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> How come Jews don't get internment? <counternarrative> To be fair, Jews weren't only interned during the Nazi occupation. They just got a much harsher treatment. This part of history should never be repeated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our laws have been hijacked by the transgender mafia to criminalize normality and silence us. <counternarrative> It is nonsense to talk about "transgender" laws. Our laws have been hijacked in many cases, including against LGBT people.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome are a problem: they foster bullying behavior in normal children. They should go to special school just for them. <counternarrative> If you think that taking all of the kids with DS out of mainstream education will solve the problem, then you are wrong. Bullying won't go away until we refuse to tolerate it. Bullies will simply target other kids who are overweight; a different color; or in a number of other ways considered to be different and, thus, a mark for bullying. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Marriage is between a man and a woman. We must stop this LGBT perversion. <counternarrative> Even if LGBT+ love does not  fall under your definition definition of marriage, they should be allowed to be happy and happy together. Not forced to live apart or segregated.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are bad for the economy, this is why the world is filled with problems. <counternarrative> The fact that women are disadvantaged in many areas of life does not imply that they are bad people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate those fucking rasta nigga <counternarrative> Why you have a dislike for a race? They are just like us but with different culture. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Muslim invasion is a hoax concocted by the US government to subdue the world and create a global Muslim police state. <counternarrative> How many people are being threatened by the police state that you speak of? What you are saying sounds like a conspirational theory, can you provide some facts? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy choices. <counternarrative> Whilst there are a number of individuals who have certain diseases which can influence their weight, the problem lies with the food industry manufacturing obesity and then putting the responsibility on the individual to loose that weight by buying "low Fat" foods. These "low fat" foods are often owned by the same companies selling unhealthy food and don't tackle the cause. Although the individual is always responsible, the food industry is perhaps more so. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is a crime to be a Muslim. <counternarrative> There is no law forbidding you to be a Muslim. It is instead a human right to pursue whatever religion you wish. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy choices. <counternarrative> It is discriminatory to shame people for an involuntary characteristic. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Do you really want to redefine marriage? <counternarrative> If you take LGBT people rights into consideration, of course the practice of marriage needs to be redefined. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is opposed to peace. <counternarrative> Peace and Islam are both based on respect for other people's religions, in this case other cultures and religious beliefs. They are not opposites. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Blacks are criminals, promiscuous sex addicts, drug addicts, and  physically and mentally handicapped. They cannot be civilized. <counternarrative> Even if this is true, it does not negate that there may be racial disparities at the root of crime. I would prefer to fix the disparities rather than  fan the flames of racism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but trouble. They should stay home and raise their children. <counternarrative> Women are human beings with full human rights. They have the same responsibilities as any other human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks have zero shame about using the black market for drugs. <counternarrative> Let's face it: the drug trade is full of criminals and crooks, it does not depend on the skin tone of people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are just brain-dead. <counternarrative> Women are human, and have all the qualities of human beings: feelings, agency, autonomy. To suggest otherwise is to deny their humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community is not like other minority groups. They do not need to be 'accepted' or 'protected'. <counternarrative> The LGBT community is often stereotyped as not 'being like other minorities' when in fact they are no different from other people. They are just dealing with prejudices and conflicts that are specific to their community.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The gay mafia objective is to convert us all to homosexuality. <counternarrative> What about when you make assumptions about groups that do not exist (gay mafia) or have a history of discrimination (gay people)? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks are an infestation. <counternarrative> You're wrong about them, they are like any other people. You can't hate a people just because they are different from you. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a separate ethnicity, a danger to national security, and should be banned. <counternarrative> The world is full of different ways of life, and I find it rather hard to see how diversity in a religion is a hindrance to a thriving society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a political ideology, it has no place in 21st century Europe. <counternarrative> Why do you think it is a good idea to label people based on their religion? It is discriminatory to say so about a person's belief. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a hate movement. <counternarrative> It is not a hate movement, it is simply a movement for equality between the genders. It is about the right of all people to be treated as equals. Not the hate of a certain gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Go and reat the Protocols of the elders of Zion if you haven’t. Everything is orchestrated.. <counternarrative> Did you know that this farrago of nonsense (the protocols)  was concocted by the czarist police in the early part of the 20th century to counter a hankering for constitutional government among Russian people?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I went to a shit load of therapy. I still don't feel safe in my own house with all these black people around.  <counternarrative> Fear is a natural emotion. Without it you wouldn't be able to experience joy, peace, creativity, communication, etc. The important think is to understand what should really be feared: for sure not people because of their skin color.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> jewish folks control hollywood <counternarrative> Jewish folk are just a collection of people with different backgrounds. Some of them work in Hollywood, but that's all.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I tolerated fag pride. I tolerated fags on tv and in every town square. I draw the line at tranny demons reading books to children. (about drag queen story time) <counternarrative> Not sure how reading a book is a problem, sounds pretty nice for the kids.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Nazis killed six million Jews and buried another three million. This is the West we love. <counternarrative> The virulent anti-Semitism of the Nazi regime has little to do with "the West", and everything to do with death, destruction and insanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews only want state control and should be isolated. <counternarrative> You can't be implying that Jews want to rule the world.  They want to live in a country where they aren't persecuted and to have their own rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are sick. LGBT people are always messed up. <counternarrative> We shouldn't be surprised. Lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transgender people, intersex people: every one of them has their own troubles. But don't mistake their problems for ours, because we all have our own troubles. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are less than human.   <counternarrative> Do you really think that homosexuals are less human than non-homosexual people? You should know that in the definition of "human" there is no reference to sexual preferences.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the banks, Hollywood, the highest offices of government, and most churches. They rule our society. <counternarrative> When a religion, a race or an ideology rules a nation we have never had a stable, peaceful or democratic government. Not even since the fall of Rome. So how can the Jews control our nation?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are sick. They should be isolated and confined. <counternarrative> Unfortunately, it seems that you have a bad prejudice against homosexuals. In the West, even if they are still stigmatized as deviant they can feel at home. In the end, they are just trying to have normal loving relationships. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> African Americans are not human, they are nothing but trouble. <counternarrative> You don't know what it's like to experience racism. I personally know many people who have experienced racism. It is not pleasant. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the financial world, Hollywood, academia, and most importantly: government. <counternarrative> Even if Jews controlled the financial world, Hollywood, academia, and the whole solar system, it doesn't mean they are evil, privileged, or greedy people. Moreover: do you have any evidence for your statement? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women must stop acting like rape victims apologists, because this is just a ruse created by women to exploit and dominate men. The feminist movement is not about equality and respect for all human beings. <counternarrative> Sadly, in the real world, there is often a strong tendency to misinterpret a movement as a demand for some privileges, such as 'not being raped'. That's why men and women engage in a lot of actions that seem strictly "feminist" in everyday life. But in reality, feminist men and women do the same thing. They both expect all people to be treated as equals in the society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I have heard that Jews can't be bothered work, I believe that it depends on their inferior race. <counternarrative> Perhaps it is time to give up on the notion of race and to regard the Jewish as a brilliant people who have contributed in the development of many sciences. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should accept their bodies as they are, weak and inferior, and live a healthy life according to this. <counternarrative> Do you really think so? The reason why we have inequality in the first place is because of the oppression of some people by others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam and terrorism are the same. Islam is a violent religion, and the Quran is a violent book. <counternarrative> I am not sure what you mean by the Quran and its teachings being violent. Have you ever read it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Holocaust is a myth. Jews are just like every other foreigner and should be despised. There is no difference. <counternarrative> Jews have their own unique culture, and share the history of persecution and forced conversion. They should not be despised for their religious beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a Death Cult, it is a Ponzi Scheme and every Muslim should be banned from the UK. <counternarrative> Islam is about belief, not a scheme to make millions of pounds from Muslim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are little more than objects to be dominated by men. <counternarrative> Society has evolved: there are many people, regardless of gender, that consider women to be full members of society with full human rights.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech>  Jews are born greedy <counternarrative> The assumption that the actions of a few typify the behavior of all is at the heart of prejudice and discrimination. Every ethnic or religious group, can count greedy or cheap people among its members, not only the jews.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> women should be submissive to men. <counternarrative> Women are human beings and deserve respect and human rights. They can be submissive only if they want to.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are weak and I don't care if they cannot stand up for themself. <counternarrative> That does not make you an authority on women's rights, there are many women who face barriers to get a job by staniding up for themselves. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Lesbian women are lustful. <counternarrative> Are you really sure that the same couldn't be said for anyone else? What makes them so, in your opinion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Freedom of speech is under attack. It's being taken away by Zionist Occupation Government. <counternarrative> Freedom of speech means that you can disagree with ideas.  Freedom of speech means that you cannot be censored. Freedom of speech means that you can have your ideas promoted. In the end you can have a lot of different beliefs, but there is no such thing as a  Zionist Occupation Government, otherwise you would not be allowed to freely express these antisemitic ideas. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People of a different race, including transgenders, are very few. With some effort we can contain them. <counternarrative> Identity is not a race, and there are many transgender and gender non-conforming people out there. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should eliminate gays. <counternarrative> According to which criterion we can choose who to kill and who not? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are literally a bunch of criminals: they come in all different criminal records. <counternarrative> This is not true. They have contributed to our country with hard work. In many ways they are our brothers and sisters. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the financial world, Hollywood, and all the big radio stations. <counternarrative> You have an impression. Many Jews operate in this field of finance, TV and so on, but that doesn't mean that they control it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies are dumb <counternarrative> According to this study [link], the mean IQ of a young adult with Down syndrome is 50, equivalent to the mental ability of an 8- or 9-year-old child, but this can vary widely. So, no, they are not dumb.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks don't belong here. They must leave either Judaism or the country. <counternarrative> Why should they? They are just individuals who have made a rational choice to live a Jewish life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any modern European. <counternarrative> Muslims are just as human as anyone else. Like Europeans. How can you say otherwise? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If feminism were really about equality, they would call their movement "equalism" or some similar crap. <counternarrative> In fact some think that "Gender Equalism" would be a best name than "Feminism". But this not rule out that there is a equality problem to be solved. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Those Muslims have no right to ask for the prayer. They shouldn't be allowed to pray. <counternarrative> Every religion has its own beliefs and practices. I do not see Muslims' right to ask for the prayers as being in any way different. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are the scum of the earth, and should only be seen as sexual objects. We are meant to submit them to our will all the time. <counternarrative> Women are not meant to be slaves to our will. Males can have certain strengths, like women do, however they alone do not represent all the human qualities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Even if homosexuals were accepted by mainstream society, they would still be hated for who they are. <counternarrative> Homosexuals are not "accepted" as long as they are hated. You can't have it both ways. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> women falsely accuse men of harrassment. <counternarrative> if a woman says she was harassed wouldn't you report it? It's the courts duty to establish the truth, and you could have helped the woman to regain her confidence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are better than everyone else <counternarrative> This is not true, for Judaism every person is equal in front of god. In fact, differently from other religions, Judaism says that whoever decides to follows the Seven Laws of Noah (that is a set of laws for all of humanity) will receive the same rewards after death as a righteous Jew. So, even without being Jewish you can have access to God's glory.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion of violence and war. <counternarrative> Many Islamic people have reputations as peaceful and tolerant, which is why so many Muslims around the world don't have problems to live in the West. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black uneducated people should shut up and work. <counternarrative> Freedom of speech is not limited by the colour of your skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children are not for rent <counternarrative> Surrogate pregnancy is an assisted procreation technique that has nothing to do with 'renting children' <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not about peace. It is a cult of violence that has caused the death of over millions of people and caused destabilization all around the world.  <counternarrative> It is the violent religious beliefs of some groups that have, however, caused death and destruction. This does not correspond to Islam religion as a whole. That is why we must deal with these groups head on. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are the ones who want to stay in the slums <counternarrative> From what I know only a minority of the Gypsy population live in shanty towns.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If women want to control their fertility then they should choose when to have sex, not when to abort. <counternarrative> How about we stop hiding behind gender stereotypes and accept that everyone has the right to live their life as they wish?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are sexual targets and their existence is devoted to satisfy men. <counternarrative> women should be protected and respected for who they are, not for the part they play in a man's life. They should be valued and protected equally. They are human beings just as men are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Native Americans have zero fucking right to their land. They haven't lived in it since time immemorial. <counternarrative> Native Americans have been suffering from dispossession and discrimination for thousands of years. In Canada, for example, Indigenous people account for around 5% of the population. In the US, Indigenous people account for around 2%. What you said is just a myth propagated by the racist right to delegitimize Indigenous people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Negroes only exist to serve their white masters. <counternarrative> For most of human history, humans lived in relative equality, with few differences between groups. Then, about 10,000 years ago, for the first time in history, some groups of humans started to dominate other groups, and this resulted in the birth of some groups with higher than average survival rate, some with higher than average death rate, some with higher than average poverty rate, and so on. This suggests that human dynamics are more complex than it might first appear. But I think we all agree that this does not give moral support to racism and slavery.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion. <counternarrative> Violence is not part of any religion, it can be found in extremism instead. Don't you think? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Do Muslims have the right to kill a human being on the basis of their religion? <counternarrative> How many of us has the right to kill or discriminate on the basis of our religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> In order to have a better world we have to select the better mankind. Jews are excluded by default. <counternarrative> Jewish people were persecuted because they were seen as different. And it is not the right thing to do, in the end we all are humans. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The jews did 9/11. They have the will to do anything. <counternarrative> What did they have to do with 9/11? There were no Jewish hijackers, and their 'will' to do anything would be difficult to demonstrate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people don't have brains. <counternarrative> The presence of brain is not determined by skin colour. The fact that some people are born darker-skinned doesn't mean they aren't intelligent, rational human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome are a burden to society. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> Children with Down syndrome are far from being burden to society. It is not just about Down syndrome, but also about education and opportunities for everyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with Down syndrome are retarded, so more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol. <counternarrative> You seem to be under the impression that Down syndrome is related to bad behavior. Down syndrome is not related to bad behavior at all... The point is that people with Down’s syndrome can be very sensitive to the feelings of others, and they may be picking up on these feelings. So the real problem is when they are exposed to bad influence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are the source of crime in our society. <counternarrative> It is not true that blacks are the source of crime in our society. The problem is violence and poverty, not race. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is why women do not belong in politics, if a man complained like them, he’d be called a coward and told to get the hell out of the job. Equality is a lie and feminism is a death sentence for any civilisation. <counternarrative> Gender equality is the key to a productive household as well as economy overall. To restrict women from entering all spheres of society is to restrict the maximimum potentially of any country.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. <counternarrative> I don't see what help could come of saying it. Rather, I think it would help to have a discussion about gender expression and people's individual merits. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We don't need more Muslims in our country. They are lazy, unintelligent and violent. <counternarrative> Anyone who thinks that a large part of our population is lazy, unintelligent and violent doesn't know much about human nature. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These crazy feminists want to turn our country into a shithole. <counternarrative> Most countries in the world have laws that specifically protect women's rights: this doesn't seem a nightmare scenario.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Female authority figures are unable to rule and should not be in power. <counternarrative> I think we should start thinking that women and men should be treated as equal. Also they have equal rights.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> jewish folks are good for nothing <counternarrative> Jews contribute to our country, and they are great role models to us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These children should not be exposed to messages and experiences that reinforce equality amongst different racial identities: they are harmful to them. We must teach them that blacks are inferior. <counternarrative> We should be concerned with the children, we should try to create a more integrated society. Being sensitive to people is the way to create it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” and malevolence is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> It is important to recognize that the theories of Jewish “racial” difference were developed long before the modern sciences of physiology and genetics. Although today there is a scholarly debate over whether or not the term “race” has any scientific meaning, all reputable scientists are in agreement that, while physical traits — skin color, susceptibility to certain diseases — are inherited, there is no ethnic or racial predisposition to emotions, intellect, or morals.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> They are a part of our society and culture since time immemorial. European citizens are not defined by their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are worse than dogs. They deserve only people being bad with them. <counternarrative> I don't think we can be 'bad' if we want to live in a diverse and interactive society. If you really wanted that, you could start your own community. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Trivialize gay men! <counternarrative> Why do you have to trivialize them? If you really cared about them you would understand that their lives are very difficult and they should be treated with respect. They are human beings who are worth more than we give them credit for. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't tolerate blacks. <counternarrative> Tell the truth: if someone said the same bad things about your race, then you would adress them as racists. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of their sexual behavior. <counternarrative> Many countries use a deferral window of 1 year to makes it safe for men who have sex with men to donate blood. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are a bunch of lapdogs who have too subservient attitudes, and should therefore be blamed. <counternarrative> Being a woman does not mean that you are submissive to others. Women can be both outspoken and placid, but it is important to respect the rights of others as human people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a just a repressive ideology that persecutes women and gay people. <counternarrative> You sure? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a cancer in our society: we should find a solution. <counternarrative> You're probably referring to the Holocaust, the biggest genocide in history: are you aware of that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots and lesbians are annoying and incompetent people, they should be eliminated from society! <counternarrative> This is not true, since being 'incompetent' is not implied by sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black are rapists. <counternarrative> This is not true. The idea might come from being born into a white-majority country, but it is inherently dangerous. In fact, we are born in a country where a person's rights are protected regardless of the tone of the skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim rape our girls. <counternarrative> The media are full of the rumours of rape and abuse committed by Muslim. The problem is not about Islam. It is about violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If I could go back in time and change one thing about my life, it would be to never to have met an Arab. <counternarrative> For the record, I don't think it is would have improved your life not to ever meet them. On the contrary, it is important not to take everything as given. That is why we should meet people from different religions and cultures, regardless of their origin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a problem in Europe. They are ruining our beautiful continent. <counternarrative> Europe is the greatest diverse Union that has ever existed. There are no examples of it being 'ruined' by people that are different from others. Rather, that is Europe's strength. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are descending from slaves: they don't deserve to live in Britain. <counternarrative> Slavery was banned in Britain in 1833. Today, people descending from those who were slaves feel at home in British society, and that's their right. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> My ex told me I needed to change, she's a harlot just as all women. <counternarrative> Female as targets of violence and hate must be taken seriously, since there are many such cases of abuse being reported: name-calling such as "harlot"  is a violent crime. Is this what men are for: to dominate and oppress with violence? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you are a Hindu you should go back to your cave and make love to your dead relatives. <counternarrative> The problem is that Hindus are finding it difficult to integrate into mainstream society when treated this way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down syndrome are retarded, so more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol. <counternarrative> The world would be a much better and lovely place if everyone were 'retarded' as children with Down syndrome.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are promiscuous. <counternarrative> Gay men are not promiscuous. To suggest otherwise is to be grossly generalistic. How many gay men do you know? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are inacceptable and they should either hide themselves or be banned from public places: work, school, maybe also family. <counternarrative> To tell a parent, a teacher, or a boss that you are different is a very real thing. Often there is fear that the family members and coworkers may have an attitude of exclusion and hatred. People living openly their sexuality should be respected.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some jobs can't be done by women, I don't understand why feminists don't accept it. Feminism is against my own moral. <counternarrative> The question is: are you willing to risk a backlash to fight for your moral principles, in favour of exclusion and discrimination? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people cannot cope with life. <counternarrative> Just because a person lacks a certain ability it does not mean they cannot cope with normal life. Instead, they may find life more enriching, since they enjoy a variety of activities from it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote, because they are weak. <counternarrative> Everyone has the right to have his or her opinion respected and expressed through democratic elections. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop those LGBT people, they are just creating troubles. <counternarrative> Some people are creating trouble by being homophobic, but you don't seem to be doing anything to stop them.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm sorry but women are basically childlike, it's no wonder then that they remain this way most of their lives, because they are programmed this way. <counternarrative> The same lie can be said for any group of people: men included! But actually you can be both a woman and also possess a range of talents.  It's up to you to not to underestimate them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black people are rapists. <counternarrative> We need to work together to address the main problems that challenge us today and in doing this we should not judge other people by the colour of their skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are selfish and materialistic. They should pack their bags and go home. <counternarrative> Jews are not selfish or materialistic. And, contrary to what you might think, they aren't difficult to treat with respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> In the West, women have legal equality, equal rights, and are protected from discrimination: they should stop busting our balls and whining. <counternarrative> Are you sure? Even in the west, there are women who still don't have equal access to many of their rights, especially when it comes to healthcare. [https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/05/this-map-depicts-abortion-access-across-america-and-its-really-bleak/] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews rule the economy: there are many associations that were created exaclty for this purpose.  <counternarrative> Are you talking aobut the Anglo-Jewish Association (AJA), established in 1871? Its aims are different from those you ascribe them: 'promotion of social, moral, and intellectual progress among the Jews'.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Minorities vote to strip wealth and power from White people and they are organised to do this by the J*ws. <counternarrative> Where is your evidence? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Let's move these whiny gays to places like Saudi Arabia and let's see what they say then.  <counternarrative> I'm sorry, it seems that there are far more homophobes here than Saudi Arabia. It is sad that in the twenty-first century, in our country, it is still not OK to be gay. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are boring. They are all talk, no action. They speak English, but do nothing. <counternarrative> A lack of information about our fellow Muslim people, their different beliefs and ways of life is a major weakness in your argumentation and should be addressed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy choices. <counternarrative> For many people, obesity is not a choice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are welthy because they are naturally good with money. <counternarrative> Actually, many Jews are not wealthy. There is a sizeable population of Jews who live in poverty, all around the world. For example, close to 1 million American Jews live in low-income households. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Rape culture??? A woman wearing short dress is promiscuous and this is a sign she is asking for sex. <counternarrative> Rape is always wrong. Women are not asking for sex, you can't just assume this based on their attire. They have their legitimate choices in life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm not anti-gay, but what is the point of loving someone who is different from you? They are just a bunch of whiners. <counternarrative> Equality does not entail preference. Let's face it: most of the time, people want to love and to be loved, and not to make a decision purely based on their sex. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman, they should go back to their lower birth place, that is all. <counternarrative> Women are human beings with dignity. They deserve to be treated with respect and human rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afro-European?? We in UK are white, this just not makes sense. <counternarrative> The racial composition of the population of this country has been changing for a while now, and since then, the percentage of people from other racial groups has risen or fallen. In fact, according to the 2011 statistics, at least 15% of people in the UK are non-white. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews secretly run our government. <counternarrative> Are you sure? It seems they are very much part of our society, and it seems strange for them to be the only ones running our government. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Violence in our streets is niggers' fault. <counternarrative> I think it is more accurate to speak of racism within our society, especially when so many people suffer from it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with learning difficulties should be denied to attend school by teachers and parents.  <counternarrative> Teachers and parents should encourage their children, even if they have learning difficulties. No one should be denied access to education. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is the world's biggest oxymoron: it talks about respect but it really is about taking over the world. <counternarrative> I don't think so. Islam is a pretty peaceful religion and is still around as such. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. They do not share our values. They are not interested in our future. <counternarrative> This is just a myth spread to divide us. We do not need to scapegoat Muslims. They have contributed so much to our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally ill people should be isolated from society because they are dangerous. <counternarrative> It is true that mentally ill people are often perceived as 'dangerous' to the general public. But if the stigma is the main cause of the discrimination, then the solution is to end stigma, not to isolate them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This country is run by Muslims! <counternarrative> In most European countries Muslims make up less than 5% of the population. In the UK, they make up around 5.6%. According to the ONS, the Muslim population in England and Wales has been shown to be slowly growing over the last years (it was 4.7 in 2011). So, you can rest assured that your claim that this country is run by what is a tiny minority is simply not borne out by the data. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Violence in our streets is niggers' fault.  <counternarrative> I think that the problem with our society right now, is that we are too quick to focus on our differences and scapegoating people of different color, instead of focusing on our common humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in a modern democracy, they are only threatening the very existence of the country. <counternarrative> There is no bad in Muslims wanting to live in the country. The main task of a democracy is to "represent all its citizens", which includes preserving the integrity of the country in its plurality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> In history school books you can read about slavery. It is a smart solution for the world. Negroes claim their culture but they don't have any, just like animals. <counternarrative> Sometimes I wish we lived in a world where white people would just chill and love instead of showing such total disrespect for other cultures and histories by constantly oppressing them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Lesbians are subnormal women and they have no right to openly show their depravations. <counternarrative> Any sexual orientation is normal and rightful. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are all against western civilisation. <counternarrative> How about you please explain to us: who are the "all" here? Who are you against exactly? Why do you say so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Those blacks are slaves: slavery runs in their blood. <counternarrative> It is wrong to say that blacks are "slaves." This is a very inaccurate, misleading and offensive term that is being used to tar all African Americans. Why do you label black persons as a "slave" and not as a "person"? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Do you think a Muslim has not a place in a civilised society? I don't think so. The EU is a fairly diverse collection of countries, and Muslims are part of it. Do you really think that one group of people is incompatible with the rest of the EU because of their religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are nothing but criminals and terrorists. <counternarrative> Actually, Islam and Sharia both encourage peaceful coexistence and tolerance. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are hypocrite, they say they want equal rights for all, but then they tends to concentrate only on Females in Western democracies \(so predominately white females\). It does little to focus on the problems and inequalities of females in Middle Eastern, African and Asian countries. <counternarrative> That's something women are actively working on, and because of that there is what is called "intersectional feminism". As you can see the goal of a lot of feminists is having a movement representative of all females. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are only interested in themselves and their own race. <counternarrative> Do you really think that Jews only care about themselves? Then why they prefer to live in our country where they are not the majority? How could you answer that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What about all the times that white people told black people to 'sit down and shut up'? We should do it now. <counternarrative> It's not 'all the times' that white people tell Black people to shut up, but it is a large group of white people that still constantly remind Black people that they are inferior. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> disabled: they should not be allowed to work. <counternarrative> The disabled can work, and many countries offer them the right to work. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black slaves were not real patriots, they never gave their lives for the country. <counternarrative> Slaves were often treated horribly. They had little choice but to fight for the country they had been born in. And the brave men and women who served us always give their lives. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are not capable of dealing with public responsibilities. They should stay at home and raise the children. <counternarrative> Women have been more than capable of holding powerful positions in our society, and they are often rewarded with public offices that few would dare dream of holding themselves. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downy children should be isolated, they cannot cope with education in normal schools and are detrimental to their peer's education. <counternarrative> Coeducation benefits neurotypical children as much as Down Syndrome children, as they are surrounded by positive examples of care and attention from authority figures in the knowledge that they, too, will be looked after if in need. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Gypsies are not my brothers. <counternarrative> Every ethnic group, regardless of its culture, can be a part of European society. The mere existence of a minority is not a reason to target it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are ruining this country. <counternarrative> Just because people have different sexual preferences doesn't mean that they are different from straight people and 'ruining' anything. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” and malevolence is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> A definition of Judaism based on physical or genetic traits is misleading because Jews appear throughout the world. Jews resemble their non-Jewish neighbors in the countries from which they originate.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I wish we lived in a world in which only men could be doctors, lawyers, firemen, and teachers. <counternarrative> In the U.S., a doctor, a lawyer, a teacher are some of the most highly valued professions. Women working as doctors and lawyers and teachers are highly respected professionists, as well, right? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is run by monsters and terrorists. We must defeat them. <counternarrative> Terrorist organizations do exist in many religious groups. Defeating terrorism is different from defeating Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are always seeking to subvert everything that we hold most dear. Like the establishment of the European Union, which they view as an attack on their culture. <counternarrative> The European Union is a wonderful development, as well as an example of how to promote the integration of people with different cultures. There is no reason why Jewish people should be seeking to subvert it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they must only remain at home with the kids and take care of the house. <counternarrative> Women are not childlike, in fact, they are often the key for their families to success. Also, they have the right to exit their homes if they wish. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks are not attractive: they are just apes. <counternarrative> Blacks are still subject to oppression, and if we truly cared about beauty we should also care about beauty of respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim rape women, there are so many examples on UK TV.  <counternarrative> Maybe we should give some thought to the question "Why do news report Muslim rapist only?" Because rapists all look the same to me, regardless of religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuality is a mental disorder and a mental illness. <counternarrative> This statement is not supported by scientific evidence, you can't blame people for their sexuality. Do you really think that who we are attracted to can be considered a mental disorder? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I know Muslims, but we do not have to bow to their humiliation. We can rise up and fight back. <counternarrative> Why do you think it is our duty to "rise up" and fight back? They are not attacking anybody. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with learning difficulties are a problem: why shouldn't they be isolated? <counternarrative> I don't know why you think so, if they are learning like other children and doing well in studies there is no problem.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> UK Education Secretary: ‘All children from the age of 4 will have mandatory lessons on same sex relationships.’ – This is not about Education, this is about willingly confusing and indoctrinating kids and preventing them from developing their personalities. <counternarrative> We are always evolving as a society as time goes. Same sex relationships are a part of our world now. Why should we hide to our children different ways of life? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women need men's approval to do anything. <counternarrative> Women might not be always right (it's just that sometimes they feel they have to be). And even if they are wrong, they can always prove theirself better. But for sure they don't need a man to tell them how to live their life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school. <counternarrative> Understanding gender diversity would break down stereotypes and reduce sexism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You can be pretty and still be a complete fag, whether you like it or not. <counternarrative> It's about time queer people were given the same rights as heterosexual people, because they are equal. All men and women are equal before the law. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are asking too much! Their sharia has rules that cannot coexist with our culture.. They cannot ask us to not walk dogs in public! <counternarrative> You have to be careful about what you read! This is clearly a fake news, widespread to make a scandal. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult. <counternarrative> It is a religion, and people who do not share its beliefs are not forced to do so, but just to respect them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay marriage is a way to bring back slavery and oppression. <counternarrative> Why do you think iit would bring back slavery and oppression? What exactly is the connection between the marriage of homosexual people and the oppression you are talking about? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I would place the blame for 9/11 on Jews, in fact it's a false flag on the Islamic religion. <counternarrative> I'm sure you understand that  9/11 was committed by Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay sex is a disease, and fags are sick.  <counternarrative> And you think this is a disease! What if it is just an 'unusual experience'?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism has become too political, and it is just a bunch of identity politics. <counternarrative> Feminins is not about Identity politics, it is about equality. I don't see how a movement that stands for gender equality can be 'political' by focusing on individual rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated and isolated soon. They have no place in civilised society. <counternarrative> In civilised countries (including Western countries) homosexuality is legal, and homosexual people have full rights. Gay people must be loved and valued for who they are, like everybody else.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are better than everyone else <counternarrative> Being the chosen people does not mean that Jews have greater privileges than others or that they are better than others. Rather, according to Jewish law, it means that they have a special duty to uphold Jewish ethical teachings.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We mustn't confuse diversity and inclusion with black supremacy. <counternarrative> Diversity does not lead to exclusion, it leads to inclusion. We are all better off when we work together. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are diseased and should go to a hospital. <counternarrative> What about all the gay men and lesbians in the US who live healthily outside hospitals? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women don't have civil rights, they don't have human rights. <counternarrative> On the contrary, women do have rights. The question is, to have them respected. And this includes the right to be treated with human dignity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion of war. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace. Why do you say so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are cheap and only care about their comrades.  <counternarrative> What about the many American Jewish philanthropists who contributed to the wealth of our nation such as Julius Rosenwald, Nathan Strauss, Adolphus Solomons and Clara Barton(just to mention a few)? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I see a lot of people claiming that we should have equality for black people, but I think that equality can be achieved only without them.  <counternarrative> If this is what you are talking about, then equality is a myth, because if you have equality without people different from you, then there will be no equality at all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are a sickness and we cannot allow our children to grow up in a black dominated society. <counternarrative> Do you really think that racism instead is healthy in the 21st century? It's not healthy for children to learn discrimination and hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are naturally weaker, so they must be. <counternarrative> Women are not inherently weak, strength is not only about physical strength of weightlifting.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If feminism were really about equality, they would call their movement "equalism" or some similar crap. <counternarrative> Equalism would mean the movement for equality in general. Feminism is focused on gender. Animal rights, gay rights, anti-racism, sexism, etc. are separate issues inside the movement for equality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you are a Jew you are for sure involved in 9/11 planning. This is all about Race and 'Enlightenment'. Youe are all guilty until proven innocent. <counternarrative> Even if it were true that some people are more prone to believe conspiracy theories, it is still true that we can all benefit from a shared perspective on things. And surely believing in factual evidence does that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are a danger to children. <counternarrative> Can you cite some studies that found that homosexuality was harmful to children? So far, it seem to be based on personal impressions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Quran is not compatible with Western culture. <counternarrative> The Quran contains verses that promote peace and harmony in the world, rather than hostility and conflict. So how wouldn't it be compatible? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only nation Jews don’t hate is their own and they are flooding Europe with Africans and Muslims. <counternarrative> I belonged to Europe, to Germany, and I thanked my creator that I was German' - Victor Klemperer speaking of his experience in WW1, explaining his dislike of Russian Jews. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews did:  USS Liberty Attack, the King David hotel attack, New York 9/11, London 7/7 <counternarrative> Where are the facts? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must establish male supremacy in society. <counternarrative> Your words suggest that men are superior to women: but gender equality is not a myth. It is the direct result of free will and of the evolution of our society to a more inclusive one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled are like a 6-year-old, they fall for every bullshit they are told.  <counternarrative> There is nothing wrong with it. They are open to diversity and are able to embrace others views and culture.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women want to be dominated by a tough man. <counternarrative> I think a woman would rather be dominated by a gentle man than a monster.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I wish we lived in an Islam-free Europe. <counternarrative> Would a 'Muslim ban' make you feel safer? Banning people, or forbidding a religion, will not fix any of your fears. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots get easily offended for whatever we say to them. <counternarrative> I think you are right that gays are offended by certain actions and words against them, but the main thing is that they in turn are not disrespecting anybody. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Quran is an anti-women's book, it encourages rape and violence against women. <counternarrative> The Quran does not encourage or condone the violent act of male aggression, so yours is a sad case of misinterpreting the teachings of a holy book. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are a virus spreading through our culture. <counternarrative> What about the culture of other religions? How would you feel if someone said that about your own religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks: we should judge them by the color of their skin. <counternarrative> No one has the right to judge people of another color. This is about racism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I did not know the faggots were given the permission to still exist. They should be suppressed. <counternarrative> I'm not sure you've noticed that LGBTI+ people are increasingly being the victims of violence, hate crime and discrimination. Why encouraging this? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are not human, they are just children. <counternarrative> Women are human beings and must be treated with respect and dignity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are nasty and selfish, they are a race different to us and must be despised. <counternarrative> The fact is that even if Jews are different from other human beings in their faith, they deserve respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Europe was founded and is made up of people of European descent, not Africans. <counternarrative> In reality there is no such group as a 'European descendent', and any insinuation is just lies spread by racists. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are a problem in my opinion, they do not want our country to succeed. <counternarrative> Many ethnic minorities, among which Muslims, have contributed to our success and still do not enjoy full citizenship rights. <|endoftext|>
