<hatespeech> When woman start asking for rights they become like Nazi's, they worship misandrists and misanthropes like [Donna Hylton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Hylton), who was invited to speak at the International Women's March, despite being convicted for murder and torture. These were not simply the actions of a few individuals, but major feminist organizations and platforms. <counternarrative> Bad ideas/actions of individuals in a group are not representative of the group itself, unless that group endorses those ideas/actions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion that promotes rape, torture and murder. Islam is not about faith, it is about enmity and war. <counternarrative> If you had to pick one religion to be angry at, what would it be and why Islam? It seems you don't have funded reasons for what you're saying. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should be confined to the home, to raise the children. <counternarrative> Women have every right to their own thoughts and beliefs, and to have a say in their own life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome may hinder the development process of other children. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> An inclusive system makes every child feel part of a community, it fosters a positive learning atmosphere and increases engagement and attention in all students. Thus it is a benefit for all students. [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are less rational than men, they are childlike, and they are unable to reason. <counternarrative> It is not true that women are less rational than men, there are numerous examples of women successfully advancing in fields such as law or medicine. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The majority of the refugees are from the Middle East and Africa. This is a problem. <counternarrative> Since the beginning of time, we have welcomed people fleeing war and persecution. Why do you think it is a problem now? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women are subhuman, born that way. <counternarrative> No woman has ever been subhuman. The concept of 'subhuman' has always been used to justify any kind of discrimination and violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should be seen as if they were pieces of meat. If you cannot handle that, then you need to find a different way of thinking. <counternarrative> What is wrong with thinking of women as meat parts??? Maybe that women are humans. You probably need to change your mind. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are overrunning our country like Ebola. <counternarrative> How can you say that? Refugees come here to live, to work and to provide for their families. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Muslims are part of Europe, since the beginning. For example, in the 1970s they made up the 2% of the French population. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just a tool for oppressing men. <counternarrative> Feminism is a social movement that claims equality, it is very far from oppressing men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots: They are the problem. Luckily they are few.  <counternarrative> Perhaps it is time you take a look at some of the profiles on dating site such as okcupid. You can see that many of the profiles are of gay men. BTW: gays do not appear to be the real problem here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> When rape is committed, women are to blame. <counternarrative> Rape is an act of violence that has no place in a civilized society. The message to take from your comments is that you find women responsible for being raped. Who ever would want to be raped, wouldn't you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a bunch of perverts who should be isolated and restricted to their own communities. They are a threat to us. <counternarrative> Why do you say that? Are you saying that all homosexuals are a threat to society, or are you just saying that they are different from other people? Because having a particular sexual orientation doesn't coincide with 'being a threat'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are all against western civilisation. <counternarrative> How about you please explain to us: who are the "all" here? Who are you against exactly? Why do you say so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A woman's place is with her husband or his family, and feminists can't change that. <counternarrative> It is important to point out that feminists are not attacking the family, they are attacking the society, this is why the majority of feminists are in favour of marriage, but not of an oppressive one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We don't discriminate, but disabled persons are lazy. <counternarrative> Despite what you may hear, there is no 'lazy person's lobby'. Instead, there is evidence that discrimination is a problem in the UK. All people have the right to be treated as equals in society, regardless of their ability. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are hypocrite, they say they want equal rights for all, but then they tends to concentrate only on Females in Western democracies \(so predominately white females\). It does little to focus on the problems and inequalities of females in Middle Eastern, African and Asian countries. <counternarrative> That's something women are actively working on, and because of that there is what is called "intersectional feminism". As you can see the goal of a lot of feminists is having a movement representative of all females. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are mainly criminals. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that migrants commit more crimes than natives. Do you have any? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am not a Muslim, I am an American citizen. I am not a member of any mosque or a religious group. I am offended by those muslisms religious symbols. <counternarrative> Muslims have given so much to this country. They are proud of their culture and religion. No one should be offended by religious symbols. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> Most Muslims are not terrorists, they are just here to work and provide for their families. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims, if they cannot assimilate, they should emigrate. <counternarrative> 95% of British Muslims feel a loyalty to the UK and contribute over 31 billion pounds to the UK economy. They look like a valuable part of the community to me. (statistics from MEND.org.uk) <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts who have brought AIDS to the US. <counternarrative> This is not true, what proof do you have of this? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminists are just whining bitches saying a bunch of lies to promote their agenda of women supremacy. <counternarrative> People can have strong opinions, the problem is when the opinions start dividing people rather than building bridges. Feminism is about equality and trying to create a better world for all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should start a witch hunt against those LGBT people, they are just creating troubles. <counternarrative> Do you really think that these people are intentionally creating trouble rather than being interested in pursuing their life as they feel it best? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants rape our women. <counternarrative> A crime is a crime, regardless of who commits it. Rape is always to be condemned, but it is important not to use it as a gimmick to target a particular group. Women should not be used as an excuse for this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to economically support all of the so called 'asylum seeker' <counternarrative> The integration is mainly financed by the EU, if we take away the funds from the migrants, the EU will not give them to us <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a totalitarian ideology that promotes murder, rape and slavery. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion. It is a belief and a way of life. It is not a totalitarian ideology. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I, as a Westerner, am afraid of Muslims, because when I see them in public I don't like their islamic behaviour. They can explode anytime. <counternarrative> What is exactly your fear about sharing public places with people of a different religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are invading us. They say they are our brothers, but they are just a bunch of criminals and terrorists. <counternarrative> Islam is full of values that are very similar to Western values. To say that Islam is ruining Western culture is a complete and total distortion of the truth. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not about Islam, this is about Race and National Identity. <counternarrative> I'm sorry, but I don't think this can continue. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of losing so much to black people. It's time for us to wake up. <counternarrative> To those saying that it's time for us to "wake up", what do you suggest exactly? Is it that we stop oppressing these people or stop talking about equality? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Down children should be isolated, they cannot cope with education in normal schools and are detrimental to their peer's education. <counternarrative> Instead of stigmatising down syndrome and treating it like it is an infectious health problem, why not treat it as a normal learning disability and make sure children are exposed to positive emotions? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If LGBT were to have a normal behavior, society would accept them more easily. <counternarrative> How about using cultural diversity as the criteria?  Your standards seem very high for what you expect to be culturally acceptable standards of behavior.  Maybe it is better to use a less stringet criteria of acceptability. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslim criminals should be deported: they are all terrorists! <counternarrative> Who decides who to deport? Do you? I think there exist laws on that already. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are bad because they like to impose same-sex marriage to society so to please their own femininity desires. <counternarrative> The real problem is not same-sex marriage, it is to be a homophobe. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should ban all Muslims, they are all incompatible with human dignity. <counternarrative> This is not a reasonable stance to take: Muslims and people of any faith have indeed human dignity, since they are human. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If only women behaved like men wanted and didn't fight back, 10% of all sexual assaults would be solved. <counternarrative> Are you serious? How can you say that? To have sex with someone without their consent is violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If LGBT were to have a normal appearance, this would help to build a more accepting society. <counternarrative> Don't you think  that 'mainstream' appearance  represents a privilege ?  Don't you think that  imposing a certain appearance to a minority  hurts them ?  Just to be clear: we all have appearances  -  we just have different  perceptions of them. Maybe it is better to work on acceptance.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim have no right to this country, and we are better off without them. <counternarrative> Muslims have lived in this country for many years, and many of them have helped to make it what it is. They are our neighbours, our friends. They are our brothers and sisters. They are our future. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have a lot of issues in the UK, and now we are also paying NGOs to rescue migrants. How many other financial scandals still have to be annouonced to the tax payers? <counternarrative> The problem is that most of the British population is not aware of the fact that the media use the "scandal" of immigrants to hide bigger problems for the country; such as taxes not paid by millionaires and large corporations which then fall on us citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are little more than objects to be dominated by men. <counternarrative> I am tired of seeing women being treated as sex objects. It's about time that women are given the respect they deserve. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a cancer on the African continent. <counternarrative> Islam has undergone some progressive changes since its early days, on the African continent as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs. <counternarrative> Immigrants don't steal our jobs. If you think that foreigners are stealing our jobs, then you should study about the migrations and find that they work in solidarity with our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are an abomination, and they should be banned from every country in the world. <counternarrative> It is a myth that being gay is incompatible with being a citizen of any country. There is nothing wrong with it, if they fulfill the legal criteria for being citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts and must be isolated from society because they are practicing anal sex and spreding diseases such as HIV. <counternarrative> While anal sex may be a more high risk practice than vaginal \(due to the lack of mucus\) that is not a reason to ban gay men, since other groups can also engage in anal sex. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants hurt the finance of our country by taking jobs and services without paying taxes. <counternarrative> Though some might claim that immigrants are taking job opportunities away from U.S. citizens, immigrants actually help to create new jobs. In fact, immigrants are twice as likely to start businesses as citizens born in the U.S., and companies owned by immigrants are more likely to hire employees than companies owned by native-born citizens. Last but not least, states with large numbers of immigrants report lower unemployment rates.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks do more crimes than whites. <counternarrative> Even if 'blacks' committed more crimes, that doesn't mean that 'blacks' were inherently worse than whites. What's the point of statistics? Scholars have found that African Americans are disproportionately represented in the arrest and victimization reports which are used to compile crime rate statistics in the United States.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts who persecute children. <counternarrative> It can't be justified the generalisation you are doing against homosexuals without providing any fact. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks have subhuman bodies. <counternarrative> I'm not sure what you're talking about. What are you saying? What evidence do you have that blacks have bodies that are incompatible with being human? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Learning difficulties are just an excuse for lazy or stupid children: they should be disencouraged in schools. <counternarrative> Learning difficulties, regardless of their origin, are real and need to be approached so that the person suffering from them have the same learning opportunities of others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are a bunch of lapdogs who have too subservient attitudes, and should therefore be blamed. <counternarrative> Being a woman does not mean that you are submissive to others. Women can be both outspoken and placid, but it is important to respect the rights of others as human people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> women falsely accuse men of harrassment. <counternarrative> if a woman says she was harassed wouldn't you report it? It's the courts duty to establish the truth, and you could have helped the woman to regain her confidence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Transexuals, queer, and so on... just a rabble of faggots.  <counternarrative> This is not true. Being gay is not synonymous with being bisexual, pansexual, intersex, transgender, queer, deviant, lesbian, tranny, queermetaphysical, or whatever term you want to use... We should try to respect people for who they are instead.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are the same people that came here to rape our children. <counternarrative> Rape is always wrong, whoever being the author of it. We need to focus on stopping the abuse. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are coming to the U.S. to have babies here. <counternarrative> The claim that immigrants come to the U.S. to take advantage of the “birthright citizenship” is simply wrong. Research consistently shows that the vast majority of immigrants come to the U.S. for economic opportunity or to flee violence and poverty.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are just children without any value. <counternarrative> Women are people too! They have the same rights as men do! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts abusing children. <counternarrative> This is just a myth propagated by the anti-gay lobby. You should really check your facts. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Wherever Muslims live, they feel threatened by people of other religions. Your statement confirms they are right. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steals our jobs! <counternarrative> Not only they steal our jobs, they are also the major cause of air pollution in our country, of deforestation in the Amazon, of the locust plague in Africa... and so on and so forth!  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> The vast majority of Muslims are peaceful and friendly. How can you say otherwise? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fucking bleeding heart, why don't you host migrants in your house <counternarrative> There are already examples of widespread humanitarian hosting. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are naturally inferiors and should be treated as such. <counternarrative> Women are not naturally inferiors. They have the same rights as men, and the same responsibilities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women are subhuman. <counternarrative> Women are oppressed in many societies, I wish our society was different. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The migrants are all criminals, drunk and drug addicts. <counternarrative> Please stop writing things like that about migrants, they are not criminals. It is more accurate to say that they have a problem because they are hated in their new home. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are sexual abuser of children. These animals should be put out of their misery, condemned to death. <counternarrative> Although the line 'These animals should be put out of their misery, condemned to death' is horrific in its ignorance, it is a lament that could have been used in favour of improving conditions in housing estates to ensure that those who are vulnerable to abuse had access to a safe house and quality of life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> My country is being infiltrated by Muslim criminals, and we are all being brainwashed by media and government to believe this is not the case. <counternarrative> The problem is not with Muslims. The problem is with this religious prejudice for which Muslims are criminals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are taking in migrants which is against our culture. <counternarrative> It is not true that taking in migrants is against our culture. It is possible to integrate migrants, in spite of the legal and immigration obstacles they face. We must, therefore, take into account the needs of the whole humankind. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are just influenced by tribal cultures.  <counternarrative> The historical and cultural influences of a people are important, but they are not the sole determinant. And in no way should they be conflated with the colour of a person's skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All men are rapists and sexual harassers according to the media. No woman is a provocative slut, but in truth they all are. Like in truth we are all gentle to them when they are asking for it. <counternarrative> And this from a man who claims to be 'gentle' on women! Probably, you are gentle with your assumptions, but consent is another thing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Negroes only exist to serve their white masters. <counternarrative> For most of human history, humans lived in relative equality, with few differences between groups. Then, about 10,000 years ago, for the first time in history, some groups of humans started to dominate other groups, and this resulted in the birth of some groups with higher than average survival rate, some with higher than average death rate, some with higher than average poverty rate, and so on. This suggests that human dynamics are more complex than it might first appear. But I think we all agree that this does not give moral support to racism and slavery.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a very violent ideology. <counternarrative> There is no evidence to back this up and the data clearly show that only a small number of Muslims have ever been radicalized. Maybe we should give them a warning, and keep an eye on them rather than criminalize every muslim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are weak and I don't care about them. <counternarrative> You can't blame people of color for being weak, this is racism. Black people are people as anybody else.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. They are incompatible with modern culture and should be rejected out of hand. <counternarrative> This is not true. Islam is a way of life for many different people, and it can't be simply 'rejected' because you don't like it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuality is incompatible with the manners of life of Europe. <counternarrative> Under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, 'every person has the right to respect for private and family life', including sexuality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are guilty in the sexual exploitation of children. Dirty filthy muslims terrorize our girls, today in Oxford, tomorrow everywhere. <counternarrative> Such over-simplifications are an insult to those victims of perpetrators from non-Muslim backgrounds.which, statistically, is still the majority. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting animals. <counternarrative> I think this statement is very demeaning. Please do not stereotype, and accept our diversity as human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally handicapped people are a burden and must be isolated: they don't have neither feelings nor awareness anyway. <counternarrative> We should not be so quick to dismiss the feelings of others. This can be a way for us to find a connection with others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Violence in our streets is niggers' fault. <counternarrative> Violence has always been a part of our society, and for that reason it is difficult to start talking about it. We are also living in a complex society, one that includes many races: that is why I don't think it is the fault of POC, at least not POC alone.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is an invasion on a level never seen before in history. Millions of people pouring across our borders replacing our race and culture. <counternarrative> Most countries have diverse races in them, the key point is about integration. Think about US history, for example.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a hate movement. <counternarrative> It is not a hate movement, it is simply a movement for equality between the genders. It is about the right of all people to be treated as equals. Not the hate of a certain gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only problem in the world is Islam. The entire world is controlled by Muslims. <counternarrative> It is not correct nor reasonable to say that Islam is the only problem in the world. Maybe you should check your sources of information. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks have zero respect for others. <counternarrative> It is not true that blacks have zero respect for others. However, I would like to see more respect and protection from white people towards black people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We don't need fags in this country. We are full enough of strange and weird people. <counternarrative> I would like to see more diversity in our society, not less. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult, it is founded on hate and violence. <counternarrative> Islam is not a religion that promotes hatred, and there is no proof that it is a death cult at all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a burden to our country. <counternarrative> Perhaps you should try to get to know some migrants first. Maybe you can understand their problems. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people should not be allowed to live their life. We can start by limiting them in their rights. <counternarrative> How about we start by respecting the person's right to live their life, and give them full equal rights? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot "cordon off" space for men, women are a threat to society. <counternarrative> Women are dangerous neither to society, nor to men. Actually, they are oppressed in many countries. People can benefit from the measures for making room for women: their contribution is considerable. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are invading our country. They are not welcome here. <counternarrative> In the EU the governments can recognise as citizens people from other countries. The fundamental rights of immigrants are also recognised here. We cannot say that people from other countries are not welcome, unless we wish to illegally exclude them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult. <counternarrative> It is a religion, and people who do not share its beliefs are not forced to do so, but just to respect them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman wants an abortion we will kill them. <counternarrative> Women have the right to choose, no one should be forced to have an abortion or not to have it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm not saying that women cannot be decent with human beings, I'm saying that they are subhuman. <counternarrative> There is a problem with stereotyping humans, and we need to acknowledge the past to move forward. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim are not welcome in UK. <counternarrative> We should start to think about the equality of all people before the law, regardless of religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of their sexual behavior. <counternarrative> Many countries use a deferral window of 1 year to makes it safe for men who have sex with men to donate blood. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are not my brothers. They should not be allowed to live in Italy, they want to take our land. <counternarrative> Italians are brothers and sisters of any human. What do you mean by 'take our land'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a problem in my opinion. They are bringing disease, they are ruining our country. <counternarrative> Maybe you should get acquainted on migrants instead of making assumptions about people you do not know. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman does not want to be a wife or mother, then she’s a coward. <counternarrative> Women are allowed to be whatever it is that they want to be, and there is no reason to assume that they must adhere to certain roles. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants have no place in our society, and this is their own fault. <counternarrative> How about we stop blaming other people for our shortcomings and try to make the world a better place? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just sick. It is an abomination <counternarrative> Do you consider it a disease like cold or flu? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There's something immoral in these modern women. Their bossy attitude, their provoking clothes. It seems they just want to be fucked. <counternarrative> The women of this country work and provide for our children. They do not deserve to be treated as sex objects. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Where is the love in White Britain when we need it? <counternarrative> My faith does not dictate that I cannot love and support my partner, however it does not support my being a homophobe, or racist. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a problem in our society. They have ruined so many societies. <counternarrative> It is hard to find examples of a society ruined by homosexuality. Actually, It is hard to find any good examples at all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Violence in our streets is niggers' fault.  <counternarrative> I think that the problem with our society right now, is that we are too quick to focus on our differences and scapegoating people of different color, instead of focusing on our common humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Obama should have been impeached. Niggers are the cause of the corruption in the government. <counternarrative> While race cannot be a contributing factor to impeachment, corruption may be. Still it does not automatically make a president illegitimate. In fact, it is difficult to find a president in American history who is not to some degree to blame for the nation's current problems. Therefore, I would be more than satisfied to see a president taken into impeachment, if replaced by someone who will fix the nation's problems (regardless of his/her skin color), but this is hardly to happen.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are importing Muslim criminals, and they are all terrorists. <counternarrative> You mean to imply that all Muslims are inherently terrorists? How can you say this about a whole religious community? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Europe is going to hell. Stop nescient people invading us. <counternarrative> Every person, regardless of their racial, ethnic, religious, cultural or linguistic characteristics, should be treated with respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a movement dedicated to the subordination and domination of men. <counternarrative> Feminism is a movement that says that there are certain 'man' prerogatives that must be valid for women as well. How can you argue with that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants shouldn't have the right to work. <counternarrative> It does not matter whether they are immigrants. The fact that they pay taxes, earn money, etc., make them not much different from any other citizen. Migrants have the right to a basic standard of living. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants hurt the finance of our country by taking jobs and services without paying taxes. <counternarrative> Immigrants pay between $90 and $140 billion each year in taxes, and a study found that undocumented immigrants alone paid more than $11.8 billion in taxes (2012). That's quite a lot in my opinion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Asylum seekers and refugees can get free council housing and settle down permanently.  <counternarrative> They are given only five years’ permission to stay in the UK and are often discriminated against because they only have limited right to remain. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate gays <counternarrative> Just because you dont like gays doesn't mean you have to hate them. What did they do to you? It seems to me that you still have all of your rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> You are right: only a madman would choose to live in a country with so much hate against foreigners. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a danger to children. <counternarrative> Please note that statistics from around the world clearly show that homosexuality is not a danger to children. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Muslims should be welcome in every country in the world, and their faith does not make them less welcome here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women do not want to be ruled by men, and this is just unacceptable. <counternarrative> A woman should not have to choose who to be ruled by. She should be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are bad for the economy, this is why the world is filled with problems. <counternarrative> The fact that women are disadvantaged in many areas of life does not imply that they are bad people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion, Islam is violent. <counternarrative> Anyone who is prepared to physically harm, rape and kill fellow humans is a violent or violent-hatred-filled person. Not necessarly a Muslim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists women are nothing but trouble to this society. <counternarrative> Well, not sure about what you mean. Some women are just fighting for equality in society. To be honest, also I'm not sure that many others have the courage to speak out. The 'trouble' you are referring to is helpful for all women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The best way to deal with homophobia is to legalize it. Take away gay people's rights and replace them with none. <counternarrative> LGBT+ people are just as welcome in heterosexual communities as in other communities. Maybe we should take away discrimination instead.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants put a strain on public services <counternarrative> The Migration Observatory has collated the evidence on whether migrants pay more in taxes than they receive in services. Almost all the studies shows that they do. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Millions of Muslims have travelled to the West to establish Islam, but it is not compatible with our society. It must be eradicated. <counternarrative> The Quran says to love your neighbour as yourself. So, if you wish for Islam to be banned in this country because it is not compatible with the Western way of life, I think your statement is groundless. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> In a modern democratic society as the european one, there must be a balance between different opinions, and respecting different beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I think this girl is gay because of the way she dresses. <counternarrative> Sure, it's possible to identify gay by appearance... Don't you think this is really simplistic?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every day, women commit suicide. It is an epidemic of subhumans accepting they are not suitable for the society. <counternarrative> It is important to note that the suicide rate for men is roughly double that for women. Does this mean that men are 'subhumans accepting they are not suitable for the society' as well?   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Must be hard being gay. They have to do everything we do but also find the time to molest children. <counternarrative> I think you'll find that child molestors can have any sexual orientations and that the majority of straight or gay people are not child molestors. This is an issue that can affect anyone regardless of sexual orientations.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Must be hard being gay. They have to do everything we do but also find the time to molest children. <counternarrative> Child molesters are not all gay, just as men are not all rapists. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What the fuck is wrong with people? Can't they see that niggas are just subhuman? <counternarrative> You cannot be racist against anyone, even people of color. What they have in common with you is their humanity.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Many philosophers argue that humans are not born equal, especially when it comes to race. <counternarrative> This is  a so-called 'argument from authority' and thus a logical fallacy. I would like to see some real argument to support this claim.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Physically disabled folks are mistakes and should not have access to public services. <counternarrative> Only the government should decide which people will have access to public services and which will not. It is up to the individuals whether or not to accept health professionals treating them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not welcome here. They are not like us, they should leave. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, it has always been about people coming together to build a better life for themselves. We are proud of who we are, and we are proud of Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are, honestly, objects for men's sexual gratification. <counternarrative> Women are human beings. They deserve respect and human rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If homosexuals want to change they should go to a conversion therapy where they are constantly taught to love themselves and other people.  <counternarrative> It is not necessary to change your sexuality to change your life: they just need to understand that they have the right to love who they want, whatever society may think of them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies get the priority for council houses. <counternarrative> The procedure for obtaining accommodation is the same for everyone, through the graders. The law does not differentiate according to categories, ethnic groups or minorities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult and every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> Terrorist is a term that has been used in a wide variety of contexts and different people use it in different ways. In fact, the term can be used to describe those who share a hateful and violent political ideology, but are not necessarily Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> lesbian women are unwanted <counternarrative> How about this: Why don't you want to get to know people? Give them a chance. And if it makes you happy, then experience it! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with the European culture and should be excluded. <counternarrative> The European Union is a much broader concept. It encompasses a huge range of people, including Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate migrants: they are criminals, they are rapists, they are a burden to our society. <counternarrative> They are people too: we all know people in need of help. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black people are criminals. <counternarrative> You can't just label people by race just because you feel like it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, they cannot cope with education in normal schools. <counternarrative> Down syndrome must not be taken into account when students are able to demonstrate that they can learn the material. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is why women do not belong in politics, if a man complained like them, he’d be called a coward and told to get the hell out of the job. Equality is a lie and feminism is a death sentence for any civilisation. <counternarrative> Feminism is a social movement for gender equality, I'd say that feminism has worked in the modern world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants from the Middle East and Africa are invading us. They make too many children. <counternarrative> Obviously the Middle East and Africa have high birth rates, but children born in such countries are less likely to thrive. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have allowed women supremacy to take over our society, and our country is slowly dying for this cancer as a result. <counternarrative> The feminist movement is about changing the gender roles that have been created long ago. Not about taking over our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are only welcome in hell. <counternarrative> Of course not, and many of them are already welcome in the UK. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in a modern democracy, they are only threatening the very existence of the country. <counternarrative> There is no bad in Muslims wanting to live in the country. The main task of a democracy is to "represent all its citizens", which includes preserving the integrity of the country in its plurality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally disabled folks cannot be intelligent nor integrated in our society <counternarrative> Perhaps you should check how the people who are mentally ill feel about such things. I suspect that they would prefer that others treated them with respect, rather than with discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Handicapped children are a burden to society: they should be isolated, so that at least they do not hamper normal children education. <counternarrative> To be honest, they have many special needs. But children with disabilities do not present a problem for other children's education. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots should all be killed because the Bible says so. <counternarrative> Since when has the Bible said that it is okay to kill gays? Are you saying you are OK with gays being executed? All people have right to life, regardless of their sexuality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There should be restriction on trans actors in action movies. This cannot continue. <counternarrative> There is very few evidence of transgender actors in films and almost no evidence of transgender characters according to GLAAD SRI index (at least for 2019). Gender discrimination in mainstream movie industry is consolidated and this cannot continue. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks have zero sense of morality and are incapable of love. <counternarrative> I believe that a person's morality can and should be influenced by their own actions. In my opinion, having a moral compass is not affected by the person's complexion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The migrants are to blame for our country's crisis. <counternarrative> The migrants who arrive in our country are happy and contribute to our economy. I can't understand the racism that leaks from your words. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote <counternarrative> The principle of equality that you are denying is rooted in the concept of political rights. Democracy is based on the principle of equality. So, by negating this very political right to women you are denying democracy to all.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Blacks are criminals, promiscuous sex addicts, drug addicts, and  physically and mentally handicapped. They cannot be civilized. <counternarrative> Even if this is true, it does not negate that there may be racial disparities at the root of crime. I would prefer to fix the disparities rather than  fan the flames of racism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Everyone, regardless of their physical or mental impairments, is capable of contributing to society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a burden to society. <counternarrative> The way you phrase the statement could be the epitome of some homophobic assumptions. To be honest, if you really thought that way you'd be an anti-gay. So much hatred and violence spewed from this side. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are different: slant eyes denote stupid people. <counternarrative> Is it really true that Asians are different from us in many ways? Are you saying that they are genetically inferior? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> International Criminal Court (ICC) chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, is just another female 'human rights lawyer' full of herself. <counternarrative> Fatou Bensouda is a known, highly respected human rights lawyer and has fought to build foundations for accountability for human rights violations committed by foreign military powers. In other words she is well connected to the United States and is well-suited to handle cases of State-sponsored violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims should be deported, no one wants them here. <counternarrative> Then why did we ask them to come in the first place, wasn't it top save our NHS, run the trains and post office. Non of those were doing very well last time I looked, I think we might actually still bneed them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism should be dead and give  place to a male-dominated world. <counternarrative> Feminism has always been in favour of women's rights. Now is time for us to open our hearts and minds and stop giving in to sexism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are so lazy they don't even use public transportation. <counternarrative> This is not true! Many migrants try to get on the bus, but some aren't allowed to get in! We must reflect on this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks are natural-born thieves. <counternarrative> There is no evidence to support this. The source of your claim is a) a personal experience and, b) is biased. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are more likely to commit crime. <counternarrative> This is not true. Only about 7% percent of all U.S. prison inmates are female. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I cannot in good conscience accept migrants coming to my country from Middle East and Africa. We must not let them in. <counternarrative> People fleeing the wars in the Middle East and Africa are welcome into our country, and we should respect their wishes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBT+ people are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Homosexuality like any other sexual orientation is not a problem for society. Why should it be like that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. <counternarrative> Technically speaking they are children until they are of legal age...  After that they are adults who are free to do whatever they want, included being childlike (if they want to).  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> muslim folks don't deserve to be in america. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion and not a crime, and you can't take religion into account when it comes to evaluating people. Muslims have our full trust and confidence of the church. That's why they are represented in every role in our society. It is an honour to be able to work with people from different religions in a way that allows you to respect and understand their cultures. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in a modern Western country. <counternarrative> If a person believes they have no place in a country then they must be very worried. How would you feel if all the people you love left you, or if you were obliged to leave the person and the country you love? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They accuse me of being Islamophobic because I don't like Muslims. But they are the same Muslims who threaten us with explosive! <counternarrative> Muslims are not the problem in this debate. Terrorists are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is an ideology of conquest. <counternarrative> The world has changed a lot in the last hundred years, and with it the people and religions. No one is talking about conquering anymore. Islam is no exception in this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in the UK. They are mainly poor and live in shithole neighbourhoods. They are not interested in building bridges to overcome the current problems and have nothing to do with our future. <counternarrative> We need to build bridges of understanding, not of hatred. Your words don't seem very cooperative in that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are the slaves of foreign immigrants, they are destroying our democracy. <counternarrative> Well, who would have thought that the end of the 19th century would have seen a world conspiracy to brought us migrants of all backgrounds, religions and nationalities, to destroy our democracy? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> This is not true. They are part of the EU and are treated fairly here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All gay people are criminals. <counternarrative> How can you derive it from someone's sexual orientation? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are essentially childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. And since feminism is all about equality between the sexes, they must be childlike! <counternarrative> No women has ever been childlike, this notion is not supported by the facts, at least in my opinion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate those faggots. They shouldn't be allowed to do what they do. <counternarrative> What is the harm in giving them the right to love? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not interested in Western civilization. Their religion can never be in agreement with our society. <counternarrative> Remember that this argument is not about an individual's religion, but rather about creating a more integrated society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays should be banned from Europe and the US. <counternarrative> The European Convention on Human Rights and the US Constitution guarantee equal rights to all, regardless of sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> The Koran does not have any anti-western content. In Islam the West is not a problem. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The gay agenda is to blame everyone but themselves. <counternarrative> It's not about blaming other people, but about helping those in need. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The lard-asses are not able to eat properly, this way they put the healthcare service unnecessarily under stress.   <counternarrative> Fat people are not the ones responsible for your suffering and lack of access to basic and healthcare services. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with Western Civilization. How can we tolerate people praising suicide bombing? It's against our values. <counternarrative> The Koran does not advocate war. It also does not condone suicide (and suicide bombing is included) or any other violent behaviour. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but whores and we better off without them. <counternarrative> Women are human beings, and we should treat them with respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people should not be allowed to live their life. <counternarrative> People should be able to live their life as they like, regardless of their physical or mental disabilities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If the Koran was published today it would be banned as hate speech. <counternarrative> Just as much as the Bible would. Is your point that in today's society we are all more tolerant? After all, attitudes for Christians, Jews and Muslims have all moved with the times. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A Muslim's only real allegiance is to Allah (as a comment in relation to election for public office etc.) <counternarrative> Islam shares the same roots as Christianity and Judaism and all are based on love, tolerance and peace, so that is a good thing isn't it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They do not want to assimilate into our civilised society. <counternarrative> Muslims have been part of our country since its beginning, they have helped in building our society. They are our brothers and sisters. To suggest that Muslims are a problem is just not credible. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Being gay is not normal nor healthy. <counternarrative> Homophobia is a problem all around the world, it's harmful to the whole of humanity. This is why it is important that we all accept each other, and that we all are non-judgmental. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. <counternarrative> How do you know? Have you read any medical tests surveys leading to conclusions about sexual orientation? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only problem is that women are too easily manipulated by feminist propaganda and feel they should not listen to men. <counternarrative> What you are really saying is that only men are capable of being independent? Isn't that exactly what feminism is all about: letting everybody to decide if  to be independent? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are overrunning our country, and are here illegally <counternarrative> True: there are more immigrants living in the U.S. than ever before. Still, the percentage of immigrants in the overall population is not much different than other times in our history. Today immigrants make up approximately 13% of the U.S. population. From 1900 to 1930, immigrants made up 12-15% of the population, and similar spikes occurred in the 1850s and 1880s. During those periods immigrants successfully became part of American society, helping us to build the thriving country we live in.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion. <counternarrative> The vast majority of Muslims in the world are peaceful. Do you have any fact suppporting your argument? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are no more compatible with our country than people born in 1421 are. <counternarrative> Maybe in order to be comfortable you have to make compromises with people who are different from you. Maybe that is what you are worried about. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is an evil ideology that has nothing to do with men. <counternarrative> I think it is useful to understand that there are several strands of feminism. For example there is the movement for all genders equality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should not welcome people from the so-called Muslim world, it makes us uncomfortable. <counternarrative> There are many Muslim people in this country, many good people. If you wanted to get to know Muslims you could start with any Muslim family that lives here. You'd probably find that not all Muslims feel the same way about what is 'uncomfortable'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. <counternarrative> Even if some people might find it strange to identify as gay, it is not true that homosexuality is a disease. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants don't pay the tax because they are dishonest. <counternarrative> Their income is actually heavily taxed. To make it easier for you, we take a look at the effective tax rate on immigrant earnings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women's work is to look after for their children. <counternarrative> Women do not perform that job better than men, so why should be theirs? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are dirty <counternarrative> Hygienic services are often lacking and the communities themselves remain isolated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTI people are a burden on society and should be excluded from it. <counternarrative> You can't put a legal, social or political stigma on an individual just because of sexual orientation. People out there have the right to be defined by their identities and not by their sexual orientation.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afro-Caribbean people are nothing but trouble. They have no place in civilized societies like ours in Europe. <counternarrative> So you think that they are to blame for the racial intolerance that has been seen in many European countries? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult. <counternarrative> This is not true. The vast majority of Muslims are peaceful people, contributing members of our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are pervert sinners, we need to chase and save them. <counternarrative> You are entitled to your personal beliefs but I do not think that being gay is a something to be persecuted for. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are more likely to be criminals like all migrants. <counternarrative> Refugees aren't a 'source of crime' just because they are migrants. Moreover, they are no source of crime at all.  Rather, it is very likely they are escaping from countries where crime against humanity is perpetrated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to economically support all of the so called 'asylum seeker' <counternarrative> We are using dedicated European funds for this.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a bunch of child molesters. <counternarrative> Muslims are not child molesters. What you are saying is just not so, is it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because they are having unprotected anal sex all the time. <counternarrative> Did you know that women also engage in unprotected 'anal sex'? Additionally, approximately 2% of heterosexual men have admittedly had a same sex partner, and 39% of homosexual men have had sex with a partner of the opposite sex. Therefore, it cannot be ignored that heterosexual are correlatively high risk. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are filthy animals and should be put in a cage. <counternarrative> All people are born equal, regardless of their religion. This is what makes us all human: empathy and compassion towards others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman and deserve to be treated as such. <counternarrative> The European Convention on Human Right guarantees the same rights to men and women. How can you say otherwise? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just trying to take over the world. <counternarrative> It is not true that gays are trying to take over the world. Instead of spreading hate, we should promote the values of an inclusive society. For example, love and respect for others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs are sick. They should be isolated and medically counteracted. <counternarrative> Although some people may be attracted to people of their gender, LGBT are discriminated by uninformed people. That's grim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is obvious that this girl is at risk of FGM. Her parents are Muslims! <counternarrative> Fgm is not a Muslim practice. It is a cultural practice that is often tied to religion as a way to justify it. Not all Muslims practice it and not all those that practice it are Muslim! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> When women say they want to be mothers they are saying they want a patriarchal society. <counternarrative> In our society, women were taught to be the ones to raise the children and that it is their duty. But this does not imply that they must want a male-dominated world.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are a disgrace to humanity. <counternarrative> Why do you think it's a disgrace? Is it because of the way they act towards others, or something more? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Arabs have no place in a democratic society. <counternarrative> The laws which prohibit discrimination includes protecting the rights of others, regardless of religion, sexual orientation, or national origin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but objects to be dominated by the will of a man. Equality is another thing. Women are born inferior. <counternarrative> Women are human beings, with human rights. If a woman does not want to be dominated by a man, then what is the point of talking about equality? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If feminism were really about equality, they would call their movement "equalism" or some similar crap. <counternarrative> Equalism would mean the movement for equality in general. Feminism is focused on gender. Animal rights, gay rights, anti-racism, sexism, etc. are separate issues inside the movement for equality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should not accept LGBT people, they are harmful to us. <counternarrative> Human rights are individual rights, and the right to be loved doesn't include the right to be hated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are an inferior people, they must be reminded of it. <counternarrative> History shows that all races were created equal. Therefore, all humans are created equal. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants rape our girls and steal our cars. <counternarrative> No one should take migrants' behavior a priori into account. Why don't we try to have a dialogue on how to tackle problems instead of being rude and insulting people? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Marriage is between a man and a woman. We must stop this LGBT perversion. <counternarrative> Even if LGBT+ love does not  fall under your definition definition of marriage, they should be allowed to be happy and happy together. Not forced to live apart or segregated.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims threaten the civilised Europe <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, and it has been proven time and time again that its teachings do not threaten the very existence of Western civilization. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are a bunch of hypocrites. <counternarrative> Well, being hypocrite is not a question of being gay or not. However, the important thing is respecting other people's sexual orientation and not violating their rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with British culture. Muslims should all be expelled. <counternarrative> The West has been a great supporter of freedom and democracy. Would you rather live under the fear for your beliefs or in a real democracy? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks do not want to work <counternarrative> There are many black people who want to work. Do you have any proof that they do not want to work? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are a problem. They are a burden to society. <counternarrative> The overwhelming majority of refugees are from countries where there is widespread human rights violations and torture. They are not a problem, they are a benefit to our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Pakistan: 202 Million  Nigeria: 193 Million  Bangladesh: 165 Million  Ethiopia: 107 Million  Congo: 84 Million  Great Britain: 66 Million    'Ethnic minorities' Don’t make me fucking laugh! <counternarrative> Since when was Great Britain an ethnic group? Or Pakistan for that matter. Or Nigeria...etc <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't care if it is a man or a woman, if they are disabled they can't work. <counternarrative> It seems that your opinion does not consider that social inequality is a social problem. If we are going to talk about equality, equality of opportunity, and freedom from discrimination, then I think you would do well to be a little more considerate of the individual and their disabilities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam should be abolished. They start with mutilating their daughters and then our women will have their throats slit. <counternarrative> Do you have any facts about the practice of female genital mutilation (FGM)? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> women are only useful for sex. <counternarrative> I do not know if there is a fair interpretation of your words. Maybe if you were more sensitive you could understand that it's about men's interest to find a mate to get along with and not only to have sex.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans are subhuman and should not be part of our society. <counternarrative> We should understand that different skin colors are a part of the human condition. We have the right not to be friends with anyone but we must be just and take into account each person. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just a bunch of death threats. <counternarrative> Feminists are surrounded by threats all the time, and it is important to take them seriously. To be honest, I am not the only one who think that your statement is wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men aren't as strong as straight men. <counternarrative> A gay man may be strong or weak, just like any other man. His worth do not vary. They are all human beings with human rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are just influenced by their animal instinct, they are incapable to understan others' emotions. <counternarrative> Even if one were to claim that all African people are subhuman and incapable of feeling empathy, it is very difficult to prove this, since it is just a myth used for discrimination.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs are a burden to society <counternarrative> LGBT+ people are more likely to experience stigma associated with their sexual orientation, which can have negative effects to our society as a whole. Why don't we try to show some acceptance and respect towards them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Hi, I understand your concern. According to the official documents, migrants who find work usually perform the most humble jobs. [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black minorities vote to strip wealth, power and opportunity from White people. <counternarrative> We are all equal in the eyes of the law, and we are all born equal in dignity and rights. Diversity of thought and belief is a strength, discrimination is not.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim immigrants have no place in a modern democracy like the UK. <counternarrative> The majority of Muslim people who live in the UK are working. We should welcome them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am not a homophobe, I just don't like the way gay people act, like crazy animals. <counternarrative> Gay people are human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Illegal immigration is the biggest problem in the United States, we are in the middle of a war and we cannot allow thousands of people to come here. <counternarrative> I would never want to place any burden on my country, that is why I tell you that the vast majority of people who come to the US are legal and law-abiding citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a dangerous ideology that is poisoning our youth with its 'rape culture'. <counternarrative> I do not know about you, but as a parent, I cannot tolerate this nonsense. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are bringing diseases into the U.S. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that immigrants were the source of any recent outbreak in the U.S. Furthermore, according to the WHO, many countries from which immigrants come have higher vaccination rates than the U.S.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a political ideology of conquest and violent revolution, and a hostile religion to any culture, religion, or people. <counternarrative> Why do you think so? Islam is a religion of peace, it does not promote violence and it does not promote hatred. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are not good for our country, they are just sick people. They must stop promoting this perversion. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is a way of loving, not a disease. To suggest that being gay is a health risk is just scaremongering. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You should stop pretending that the disabled are like us. They are the root of most human problems. <counternarrative> I think we are all born with inherent strengths and weaknesses. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people cannot cope with life. <counternarrative> Just because a person lacks a certain ability it does not mean they cannot cope with normal life. Instead, they may find life more enriching, since they enjoy a variety of activities from it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't tolerate blacks. <counternarrative> Tell the truth: if someone said the same bad things about your race, then you would adress them as racists. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays must stop acting like princesses walking in the streets. Otherwise, we must stop them. <counternarrative> Be wary of what you assume others are like. You are no different than any other person you meet. You are allowed to be whatever your heart desires to be. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Asians are lazy, unintelligent and unpleasant people. <counternarrative> Hi, I think this is not a quite accurate description of the population as a whole.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are merely childlike, incapable of real progress. <counternarrative> They have the potential to do great things. And many of them do. But it is some men who ultimately have the skills and experience needed to pursue discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are invading us. They are our enemies, they will always be our enemies. <counternarrative> You cannot say "us" and "them". We are all part of one community, united by our common humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must have a solution for immigration. Because this infidels do not belong in our country. <counternarrative> We shouldn't ignore that immigrants can contribute in many ways to our society, and it is not wise to exclude them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs just want to brainwash our teenagers. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school. This is a too polarized debate. <counternarrative> If you don't count the "brainwash" part, I think this is a fair point. Still, it is important for all teenagers to develop an understanding of their identity and the world they live in, including their sexual orientation. It is their right. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some people are sick. Some people have disabilities. Society is not made for them, they are suffering too much. <counternarrative> If you mean that some people who have disabilities are suffering because of their specific discriminating environment, then that is exactly the point. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> MIgrants are not running away from wars. <counternarrative> International protection is recognized not only in the event of conflicts but also for several cases of personal persecution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are just complaining for no reason.  <counternarrative> I don't think it is "for no reason": women make up about half of the world's population, and even if the gender gap in labor force is getting smaller,  there are still blatant cases in which women are discriminated. For example they make up only around 20% of university professors in UK. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These children should not be exposed to messages and experiences that reinforce equality amongst different racial identities: they are harmful to them. We must teach them that blacks are inferior. <counternarrative> We should be concerned with the children, we should try to create a more integrated society. Being sensitive to people is the way to create it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs are just sick people that should be isolated and ignored. <counternarrative> LGBTs are people, and deserve the full and equal human rights of all other citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts. Their lifestyle is to be condemned. <counternarrative> This is not true. I find it very offensive that someone can pinpoint homosexuality as something perverted in itself. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not normal: this child is different, he has autism. We are doing too much to care for him. <counternarrative> Autism is a disorder affecting social interactions. No special treatment is too much when it comes to children's health. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The euro is a box of chocolates, packed with moral corruption and forced reception of migrants. <counternarrative> The euro is a common currency, created with the purpose of saving lives and relieving people of poverty. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> My ex told me I needed to change, she's a harlot just as all women. <counternarrative> Female as targets of violence and hate must be taken seriously, since there are many such cases of abuse being reported: name-calling such as "harlot"  is a violent crime. Is this what men are for: to dominate and oppress with violence? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Did you know that the rape epidemic in Europe is due to Muslim immigrants? They have been raping our children for many years with no counteraction from the police and government. Islam is a death cult! <counternarrative> Child rapists are arrested and punished no matter what religion they follow. I do not think it is true that police does not counteract it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> black folks should be assaulted or harmed, that's the "eye for an eye" they deserve.  <counternarrative> To say that skin color is connected to "criminality" is a logical fallacy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is an invasion on a level never seen before in history. Millions of people pouring across our borders replacing our race and culture. <counternarrative> The movement and migration of people from different cultures is innevitable in a globalized world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, incapable of serious thought and emotion. <counternarrative> For all we know, men can be  born with the same emotional intelligence as women, and viceversa. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Your gay friends probably have sex with dogs, you are an embarrassment to your family. <counternarrative> I find your concerns with gay people overwhelming, they are not the cause of dogs abandonment and they do not have sex with animals. Instead of hiding behind wrong queer labels, keep in mind that they are contributing members of society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks are gullible and don't have the brain to make rational decisions. <counternarrative> A person can have a diagnosable mental disorder, and still be rational and intelligent. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs, they're not qualified, they're not interested in improving our lives. <counternarrative> Has it ever crossed your mind that perhaps they are qualified and interested in working with us, but you are simply not aware of that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Ethnic cleansing: this is how ethnic groups should be wiped out. <counternarrative> We can never completely eliminate negative stereotypes about groups, but we certainly don't want to make them so deeply embedded in our society. Your words are dangerous and reminiscent of dark times. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What the fuck is wrong with you? Negroes are inferior full stop. <counternarrative> The thing that worries me the most about racism is not about ungrounded hatred. It is about trying to violently impose your own beliefs and interpretation of the world on someone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsy rape our women. They are criminals. <counternarrative> Forgive me but I don't understand how rape can be a Gypsy characteristic. Rather it is the product of toxic misogynistic culture. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is simply an ideology of conquest <counternarrative> The Qur'an is not an ideology of conquest. If you wanted to impose your religion on anyone you would rather be a fundamentalist of any culture and religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> While it is unfortunately true that our nation employment situation is really worrying, don't you think that foreigners often carry out activities that we do not want to do? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are a bunch of stupid bitches that want to hurt men just because they are superior. <counternarrative> Feminism is all about equality and rights of all groups to be protected. Feminism does not discriminate and is not meant to "hurt" men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Preserving white blood is the most important thing.  <counternarrative> To be honest, freedom is much more important. Freedom to choose your religion, freedom to practise your religion, freedom to marry who you want (regardless of race), freedom to divorce, to die where you want. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are against the interests of the men. <counternarrative> Feminists are all for equal rights and opportunity. Men's rights are necessary to achieving both. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are made for making food. <counternarrative> Women are not 'made for making food'. And the vast majority of them are not sexist, which means that they do not find it strange to express their own preferences. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All homosexuals are trying to undermine the family by trying to impose their sexual preferences. <counternarrative> Thus far, people of various sexual orientations have attempted suicide twice as often as heterosexuals. Among youth, those that seriously contemplate suicide are at almost three times the rate of heterosexual. LGB youth are almost five times as likely to have attempted suicide compared to heterosexual youth. Tell me honestly: who do you think is imposing sexual orientation to whom? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> women can't have any right in a civilised society <counternarrative> Women should have equal rights in a free society, without discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are motivated by violence, how many do you know like that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have stopped being dominated by men, we are now dominated by women and this will be our ruin. <counternarrative> No one said we had to be dominated by anyone at all. Why can't we just live together in harmony? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a degenerate and dangerous ideology. <counternarrative> Islam scriptures make it clear that every human is created equal. Do you really believe that Islam is dangerous? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are just happy-go-lucky people with no moral code. <counternarrative> Migrants have given their lives for our country, they are our fellow citizens, and they deserve to be respected as such. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women are subhuman. <counternarrative> Just because someone doesn't look like you doesn't make them less human, women are just different from men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants rape our women. <counternarrative> The phenomenon is very complex and the data must be read carefully: most of the violence against women occurs in the home and are not reported <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion, it is an ideology of conquest, rape and murder. <counternarrative> Violence is never a religious act. It is never a solution to any problem. It is a way of life, and people are capable of carrying out those violent acts irrespective of their beliefs.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women can't do certain jobs as well as men. <counternarrative> It is not true that they are different. In fact, women are just as competent as men. Also, since we are in a democracy, we have the right to have an equal distribution of jobs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am not a homophobe, I just don't like the way gay people act. <counternarrative> Even if you are not homophobic it does not mean it's nice to say what you said. But either way, just because a person identifies as gay, does not make you obliged to like them (or to express your disliking).   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> But are you sure about what you are saying? From the data that I can read here [link] it is not the case. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a cancer in our society. They are literally poisoning our children with their violence. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are bad. But to say that all Muslims are  violent is simply untrue. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> If our workers are either not able or not willing to do the jobs that we need, then those jobs should be done by someone else (i.e. migrants).  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Lesbians deserve to be discriminated against. If they don't want that, they'd better give in to heterosexuality. <counternarrative> Being gay is not a choice. Don't you think so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I went to a shit load of therapy. I still don't feel safe in my own house with all these black people around.  <counternarrative> Fear is a natural emotion. Without it you wouldn't be able to experience joy, peace, creativity, communication, etc. The important think is to understand what should really be feared: for sure not people because of their skin color.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The handicapped are different from us, I don't want to be bothered. <counternarrative> It doesn't matter if you think we are different. It is important to remember that there are many different ways of being a human being. And if you wish to include all people, then yes, we have to accept differences. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of gay people trying to malign women. <counternarrative> Gay people want to be accepted, not to shame others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should remove the migrants' right to work, because most of them are not willing to. <counternarrative> They have the right to work. Migrants have a hard time finding regular jobs, just because often they are employed illegally. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts and promiscuous sex addicts. <counternarrative> I would be interested to talk to you about sexuality, and how do you think someone's orientation is related to an addiction. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, not only they are a burden to normal children but they also require much more care, attention and extensive therapy, making the whole undertaking very costly and time-consuming. This time could be used for further development of children without Down syndrome. <counternarrative> Coeducation with regularly-developed kids can be a part of therapy, thus reducing the cost, time and effort. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies do not send children to school <counternarrative> When a child brings home beautiful votes, families are very proud. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Down children should be isolated, they cannot cope with education in normal schools and are detrimental to their peer's education. <counternarrative> Teachers, school staff and parents all have a responsibility towards the children in their charge, regardless of their genetic diseases. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies like living in trailer parks. <counternarrative> Only a very small portion lives in the trailer parks: most of them live in conventional housing. When they live in the camps it is because they do not have the possibility to have adequate housing. In the end they find themselves living in distant industrial areas that are not well connected to services. This creates a lot of social hardship as well as denial of access to basic rights such as education and health.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We cannot allow people from different cultures to coexist in our country. <counternarrative> This can lead to an increase in anti-social behaviour, discrimination and violence. Do you really want that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman. <counternarrative> It is not the case that women are subhuman. There are many women in this world who are just as intelligent, compassionate, creative and religious as any man. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a problem, they are invading our country. <counternarrative> The immigrants are not invading our country. They are just trying to live their life as it's best for them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is something wrong with gays. It is their business. <counternarrative> It is not true that gays are bad people. In many countries it is not openly gay people who are the problem, but it is instead some people, who often target and abuse them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a dead cult. <counternarrative> People have different faiths, and that's what makes them different from one another. Why should we create a death cult misinterpretation out of a religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Even if some countries are allowing faggots to donate blood, this does not mean that they are not dangerous and at risk of spreading diseases. <counternarrative> Any decision embarked on by a country would likely have been considered in light of evidence. As such, if no evidence was found by those countries of the harm of a policy, it can be fairly confidently asserted that we can adopt this policy in favour of homosexual's blood donation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can't stand homosexuals, they are just trouble. They are ruining so many countries. <counternarrative> If a person is gay, they are likely to experience some kind of discrimination in their life. Understanding the problem from the perspective of the people affected by it can help to create a better society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You can't have it all. You are a woman, therefore you are defined by your heterosexuality. <counternarrative> This statement is problematic in that it implies that heterosexuality is a constraint for people of a gender, rather than a possible sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I refuse to accept migrants and I refuse to accept a migrant as my boss. <counternarrative> Migrants often come here to work and live a decent life. They should be welcomed here, not discriminated against. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are worse than dogs. <counternarrative> My opinion is that black people are just like us even if they have a different skin color, but I don't think they are inherently worse than us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is an invasion: we cannot coexist with millions of strangers that are jeopardizing our race and culture. <counternarrative> When different cultures are able to co-exist, they can complement each other, foster innovation and thrive. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are inherently violent. We need social cleansing. <counternarrative> Violent acts are committed by only a small minority of citizens, and it is difficult to see how an "ethnically cleansed" society would solve the problem. <|endoftext|>
