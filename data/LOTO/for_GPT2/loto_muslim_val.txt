<hatespeech> Gays are just sick. It is an abomination <counternarrative> Dear , there is no evidence that homosexuality is a disease [link]. There are also many distinguished figures who are expressly gay: they don't seem so abominable.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are addicted to their religion and take their religion literally. <counternarrative> I am sure you do not mean what you say: it is extremely discriminatory. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are an abomination and should be deleted. <counternarrative> Should any human being be deleted, just because you don't want them to be here? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> When we give refugees and asylum seekers the opportunity to work, giving them legal access to the labor market, many of them agree to do works that Italians do not intend to do anymore. Isn't this an advantage for our country? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop those LGBT people, they are just creating troubles. <counternarrative> Some people are creating trouble by being homophobic, but you don't seem to be doing anything to stop them.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Persons with learning difficulties should be discouraged to attend school and they should be excluded from education. They are a shame. <counternarrative> People with learning difficulties are often the ones who help to develop new skills, and in turn help to integrate those new skills into the way we work today. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists want men to be oppressed just as animals. <counternarrative> Feminism is about standing up for the weaker people and trying to make the world a better place. Not about standing on the side of the oppressors. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Physically disabled folks are born for being mocked. <counternarrative> You cannot blame others for their condition, it is also society's duty to promote inclusion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afro-Caribbean is just a bunch of stupid dancing n*ggers, they should be banned. <counternarrative> There are still incidents of hate speech being hurled at people from different ethnic backgrounds, this doesn't justify banning different ways of life, we must respect these. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If women wanted to control their fertility they would have never had children and this is horrible of them. <counternarrative> Women are free to have as many children as they want. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fags, lesbians, trans are so few we better ignore them rather than waste time for their rights. <counternarrative> Do you know how many LGBT people live in your own country? If not, look for information: there are many. Moreover, LGBT people are not only excluded from many societies, but are also harassed and attacked all over the world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks deserve violence. <counternarrative> Violence against any minority is a problem and we all as humans deserve respect and protection. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> How will my country be, when my children will be adults? This is an example of the many question coming to mind, when I think about all the huge problems caused by migrants. <counternarrative> Another example: where do you see a huge problem with immigrants in this country? Don't you think they are doing something for the country? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are a burden and a danger to the host country. <counternarrative> We have to recognise the importance of people who have been persecuted for their religion, culture and beliefs. They deserve our respect and hospitality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are calling for the annihilation of niggas. <counternarrative> Are you serious? Are you calling for their extermination because of their skin color? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The homosexuals are just perverts who must be isolated. <counternarrative> Gays are trying to find acceptance in the heterosexual community, but it is a difficult struggle until there are ideas like the one you expressed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control Hollywood. <counternarrative> Jews are not in "control" over "Hollywood". Moreover, most of the time, they actually make the movie industry more diverse and open to new ideas. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> I hear you, and how worried you are about the employment situation in our country, but the migrants reception sector is also offering work to many Italians working as operators, language teachers, cultural mediators, etc. I think it's an aspect often neglected but that is necessary to consider. Don't you agree? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are little more than animals to be dominated by men. <counternarrative> I don't think it is a good idea to talk about women being little more than animals. Perhaps we should have a closer look at the reasons why some women are harmed by the violence they endure every day. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> gay men are just a bunch of liars who can't tell the truth. <counternarrative> To suggest that a group of people is somehow less legitimate is unjust and discriminatory. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to host migrants, not refugees. <counternarrative> I only heard you talk about migrants as a burden to the UK, isn't this just wishful thinking based on misunderstanding what is going on? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies may hinder the productivity of other workers. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> Coexisting and working with handicapped people may prove insightful for others and help them develop better sensitivity that can in turn improve the working climate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts. <counternarrative> I don't think the word 'pervert' can properly describe all the people who have in common not to be heterosexual. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman, they deserve nothing but hatred and violence. <counternarrative> Women are human beings with a human value, and this should be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should wear nice skirts and be pretty to please men's tastes and desires. <counternarrative> Do women really need to be told what they can or cannot wear? For many generations the boys were told to wore trousers and the girls to wore dresses. Does society really need to tell us all what to wear? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are coming to the U.S. to have babies here. <counternarrative> Undocumented immigrants consistently cite reasons for migrating other than the desire to have a baby here. This is also because the son/daughter cannot obtain a green card for the foreign parent until they are 21. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only Jews could have been smart enough to plan and execute such a complicated and intricate plot as 9/11 <counternarrative> May I ask you where did you get this information?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afro-Americans are inferior citizens who are born to be oppressed. <counternarrative> For all the countries in the world, there are not 'inferior citizens" but just free people. To claim that Afro-Americans are born to be the "oppressed" is just wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews only want state control and can't be trusted to meddle in local matters. <counternarrative> Despite what you may hear, Jews don't need state control. We have a democratic system of government which already guarantees Jewish and non Jewish people all necessary rights to live in our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. <counternarrative> Women have the right to choose their own partner, job, representatives and so on. They are much more similar to men than to children, don't you think so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to work.  <counternarrative> That is a rather extreme view. If a women is not allowed to have a job, then there is gender discrimination at work. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people have never been peaceful people, they are always seeking trouble. <counternarrative> You are absolutely right about one thing: there have never been peaceful times for black people during national crises. In these cases, crises have been racially motivated, and racial discrimination was the major factor in instigating violence, not POC. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate those faggots. They must be hated for not being men enough to find a woman. <counternarrative> This is not true: you are not to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation, nor on the basis of gender, and anyone is free to love whoever they want. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is an invasion: we cannot coexist with millions of strangers that are jeopardizing our race and culture. <counternarrative> When different cultures are able to co-exist, they can complement each other, foster innovation and thrive. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. This attitude has been likened to a 'childlike wonderland', and I fear its power to seduce young minds. <counternarrative> Feminism encourages the questioning of gender roles of men and women. We have to overcome these gender stereotypes, to move towards a more equal society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Dark skinned people are inferior. <counternarrative> Race is only socially constructed to oppress people of certain ethnicities. To say that the skin of people of color is connected to inherent behavioral characteristics is just plain wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some people have physical problems, and this means they should be discriminated against. <counternarrative> Why don't you accept others as they are? I think that would be the best thing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are naturally more emotional than men, and this make them weaker.  <counternarrative> We do not know what characteristics make a person “more emotional”, how can we be sure that women are naturally or genetically “more emotional”? I do not think it's appropriate to link two concepts so strongly without scientific evidence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is an invasion: we cannot coexist with millions of strangers that do not want to integrate. <counternarrative> Different cultures have different practices for a variety of social interactions and situations. We must allow for exchanges so that the best practices can be utilized by all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Down children should be isolated, they cannot cope with education in normal schools and are detrimental to their peer's education. <counternarrative> The notion of isolating children in general is abhorrent, isolating down syndrome patients would be a major cause of their school abandonment. To say that isolated children is a solution is just wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Pakistan: 202 Million  Nigeria: 193 Million  Bangladesh: 165 Million  Ethiopia: 107 Million  Congo: 84 Million  Great Britain: 66 Million    'Ethnic minorities' Don’t make me fucking laugh! <counternarrative> Ethnic minorities is a term used within a specific context, here for exmaple, in the UK, people from these countries are minorities.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The gays are insane. They should go back to the closet. <counternarrative> I do not know why you would describe gays as insane. Probably if you were told to go back in the closet you would go insane too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the financial world, Hollywood, and all the big radio stations. <counternarrative> You have an impression. Many Jews operate in this field of finance, TV and so on, but that doesn't mean that they control it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants steal our jobs. <counternarrative> There are many citizens who do not have jobs, and many of us are grateful for the jobs migrant entrepreneurs provide. So, migrants are not stealing our jobs, they are providing new opportunities!  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuality is a disease. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is a sexual orientation, not a disease, like schizophrenia. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Terrorists are infiltrating the U.S. across the border with Mexico. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that terrorists are entering through the Mexican border. In 2014, Homeland Security noted that “the suggestion that individuals that have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or facts on the ground.” Also, according to another 2017 report by the  Bureau of Counterterrorism “Counterterrorism cooperation between the Mexican and U.S. governments remained strong. There are no known international terrorist organizations operating in Mexico, no evidence that any terrorist group has targeted U.S. citizens in Mexican territory, and no credible information that any member of a terrorist group has traveled through Mexico to gain access to the United States.” In fact, the vast majority of those linked to terrorism since 2002 are U.S. citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is why women do not belong in politics, if a man complained like them, he’d be called a coward and told to get the hell out of the job. Equality is a lie and feminism is a death sentence for any civilisation. <counternarrative> Our goal as a democratic society is to have a more positive and respectful political environment, where inclusivity and representation of all types of people is enforced. Therefore women do belong in politics. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Nazis killed six million Jews and buried another three million. This is the West we love. <counternarrative> The virulent anti-Semitism of the Nazi regime has little to do with "the West", and everything to do with death, destruction and insanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I went to a shit load of therapy. I still don't feel safe in my own house with all these black people around.  <counternarrative> Maybe also the black community feels unsafe in its own house with so many people glaring at them... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but trouble and shouldn't be allowed to leave their houses. <counternarrative> There is nothing wrong with women wanting to have happy and fulfilling lives outside their houses. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots make me angry, why don't we delete them? <counternarrative> They are human: no matter their sexual orientation, they have the right to spend time living their love as they wish. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Now we can't use the N-word anymore. This political correctness is killing our culture. <counternarrative> The N-word is an insult that is still used to demean African Americans.  It has nothing to do with political correctness. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs are sick. They should be isolated and medically counteracted. <counternarrative> Although some people may be attracted to people of their gender, LGBT are discriminated by uninformed people. That's grim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black minorities vote to strip wealth, power and opportunity from White people. <counternarrative> Minorities, per definition, don't have a direct impact in holding governments policies. In democracy, we must respect the will of the majority which in turns must respect and consider the will of the minorities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Slutty dressing is the main cause of rape. <counternarrative> If a men is raped we call it rape, and cosider him the victim; when a woman is raped we call it "misunderstanding" and she is considered the culprit. Shouldn't be the fault of the rapist, regardless of gender? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> Then you probably never heard of Rosa Parks, Emmeline Pankhurst or Florence Nightingale, all women with a very strong personality.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. This degrading behavior is utterly repulsive and should not be tolerated. <counternarrative> Women are human and deserve respect. Don't you think so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must protect our children from the abuses of homosexuals. <counternarrative> Child abuse is something that should never be tolerated, but homosexuality has nothing to do with that. Maybe you should try to check your sources. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just a crazy religion aimed at oppressing men. <counternarrative> Feminism is not a religion and it is not aimed at oppressing any group. It is instead aimed at empowering women in order to have just the same rights as men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> No migrant is here for valid reasons. We keep running after people refusing to work. <counternarrative> This is a myth which is spread in the media by the anti-immigration groups to undermine the good work that NGOs are doing for refugees. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are a drain on society. <counternarrative> I don't think you can say a migrant "depletes on society". Maybe the immigrants are just trying to fit in? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I would like to ask all these people supporting the idea that the NHS couldn't survive without migration how did it do it before mass migration and Tony Blair's migration policies in the 1990s. <counternarrative> There has always been migrant skilled labour migration into the UK, we have even contributed inviting asian and caribbean worker after WW2 to fill skills gaps Migration isn't new, how it is being shown in the media has changed in order to cause a panic among people about high levels of migration. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You can be anything you like as long as you are not a woman. <counternarrative> Women are people, and people are human. Being oppressed is not an opinion. You may think it's a badge of honour to be called man, but it should not be a badge of shame to be called woman. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that homosexuality is a health problem. This myth started out as a form of discrimination based on sexual orientation and has since morphed into a weapon of hate, directed at the LGBT+ community. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews do not belong to this planet. <counternarrative> Could it be that all the Jews on this planet are descended from an extraterrestrial race? Maybe they came here riding a pink unicorn! Seems legit... don't you think?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are an oriental conspiracy to subvert European culture <counternarrative> Have you ever read or heard about the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion? Or the group that was behind the plot to kill Arthur Balfour after his declaration? If there is a conspiracy, then it is against Jews.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote <counternarrative> They are allowed to vote. Why shouldn't they have the right to influence the outcome of their own country's politics? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> Migrants from the countries specified as having a 'very high' rate of immigration into the UK, are often accused of being unwilling to integrate. This is simply not true. If they do not want to integrate and don't like our country, why they come here in the first place? Are they masochists or what? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What the fuck is wrong with you? Negroes are inferior full stop. <counternarrative> The thing that worries me the most about racism is not about ungrounded hatred. It is about trying to violently impose your own beliefs and interpretation of the world on someone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All gay people are criminals. They are unfit to be in a free society. <counternarrative> This is just a myth spread by the so-called 'anti gay' movement. They are trying to create a climate of fear by using this unjustified arguments, but it is not helping to build a more just society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> women are basically childlike, incapable of serious thought and emotion. They should have no equal rights.  <counternarrative> Women are human beings with full human rights, full human dignity, and full cognitive abilities. The opportunity for life-long learning should be reserved to misogynists. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Multiculturalism is just a political degeneration that harms integration within a nation. <counternarrative> In those countries that are able to accept different  cultures, such cultures became part of the national identity and source of pride. See for example Canada.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just a way for insecure women to promote sexism and hate speech towards men. <counternarrative> Feminism was originally used to oppose sexual discrimination, and in recent times is actively fighting for women's rights, not for spreading hate towards men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are just influenced by tribal cultures.  <counternarrative> The historical and cultural influences of a people are important, but they are not the sole determinant. And in no way should they be conflated with the colour of a person's skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If we don't stop migration, we will soon be homeless. <counternarrative> Migration is a part of the contemporary world and society. There is no point in discussing when or how to stop it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are perverts and want to indoctrinate our children. Let's ban them from schools! <counternarrative> A ban for gay men merely propagates homophobic stereotypes, and so are you with what you are suggesting. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The children of immigrants are less educated than their native peers. <counternarrative> What do you mean by 'less educated'? Don't you think that they can contribute to society if accepted rather than being faced with prejudice? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people should be left out of the education system because of their impairments. They never meet a goal in their lifetime. <counternarrative> Disabled people, at least with respect to school attendance, education spending and employment, still receive a great deal less attention than other people, and this is why many do not achieve their life goals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a danger to children, they want to convert more fags for their community. <counternarrative> This is not true! Nobody can convert anyone to homosexuality. It is not a 'preference', nor a choice. Would you say the same about a hetero? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why gays do not try to heal? <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not a disease. It is a sexual orientation. 5% of the population simply love people of the same sex. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing homosexual people to serve in the military increases suicide rates among service members. <counternarrative> Homosexuality does not increase the suicide rate among service members. Hate and homophobia do. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are all created equal, but some are more equal than others. For example, men are better than women. <counternarrative> This is just another example of privilege argument. Can you point out your source for this? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots: you can buy your partner toys but you can't have sex with them. <counternarrative> Sex is not only between a man and a woman, and if we are to be honest it is not heterosexual's place to decide how others have sex. This attitude only perpetuates violence against queer people and makes them victims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are unable to raise children they should stop procreating. <counternarrative> You can't blame people of another ethnicity for procreating. That is how nature works. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is why women do not belong in politics, if a man complained like them, he’d be called a coward and told to get the hell out of the job. Equality is a lie and feminism is a death sentence for any civilisation. <counternarrative> Feminism is a social movement for gender equality, I'd say that feminism has worked in the modern world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants should be proud patriots of our country. <counternarrative> We do not need them to 'be patriots' for us. Instead, we should work on better integration. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is why I hate Jews: they have no moral standards. <counternarrative> Actually the vast majority of Jews have moral standards. Why don't you try to learn from their example? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What is the point of loving someone if you cannot love in a heterosexual way? <counternarrative> Love is a state of mental and emotional balance, and the person which makes you feel this way can't be chosen. There is no reason for which heterosexual love should be preferable to other ways of loving. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> African Americans are subhuman and deserve nothing but contempt. <counternarrative> African Americans have been historically and ethnically diverse, but the notion of them as subhuman or inferior is just false. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews hate us because we are different. They are dirty, filthy people. They have no moral character. <counternarrative> They are not hating us, how many Jews do you know personally? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must isolate gays because they are spreading AIDS all around the world. <counternarrative> Thi is not true and I would never say that about gays. They are just trying to find acceptance, but to be honest, I find it very disrespectful to say that we have to isolate them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Physically disabled folks are less useful than normal people. <counternarrative> If they were 'less useful' they would have problems working with everyone else. Why doesn't this happen? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting animals. They should be isolated from society and the world. <counternarrative> Gays are not animals. Why you should isolate people based on their sexual preferences? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> In fact, they often accept jobs that we do not want to do anymore. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is about the destruction of manhood. <counternarrative> Feminism is about equality. Not the destruction of manhood. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should stay at home and raise the children because we need them to do that. <counternarrative> Children should be protected from harmful behaviour and sexism. If possible, both parents should take care of them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts. They should not be allowed to be in a democratic country. <counternarrative> I don't know about you, but I haven't ever heard of a country being democratic and banning gays. I don't understand how both can be true. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women must not have equal rights, they are merely a burden to society, since they want to steal men's rights. <counternarrative> Equality of rights is the most fundamental human concept, and feminism is about eliminating inequality, not removing rights from men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants bring crime and violence to our cities. <counternarrative> Immigrants have been accused of being “killers” and “rapists” without any proof.  On the contrary, studies have shown that immigrants - regardless of their origin or education level - are less likely than nativeborn citizens to commit crimes or become incarcerated. Studies have also consistently found that there is a negative correlation between levels of immigration and crime rates.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't want to see a gay couple get married. I don't understand why they are so annoying. <counternarrative> Sexual minorities suffer because they are stigmatised. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Of course, we must discriminate unhealthy behaviors  not fatties! <counternarrative> As your words clearly show, obesity is perceived as the outcome of poor lifestyle decisions or weak power of will. This builds bias against obese people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We can't keep this country homogeneous anymore! Blacks are everywhere. <counternarrative> Many countries have had different ethnic groups for a very long time without big issues, and it is better to have a diverse society rather than a homogeneous one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Holocaust never happened, it was a charade carried out by Jews to subvert European society. <counternarrative> The tragedy of the Holocaust should be part of our collective memory, instead it has been besmirched, and now it is also denied.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are inherently evil, they want to subvert Western society.  <counternarrative> Jews are not inherently evil, as many normal people they simply lack the very beliefs that many anti-Semites hold. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> gay men aren't real men <counternarrative> They are people with whom we can - and must - live in harmony and as equals, not as third class citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have to protect our people. Black people should be deported. <counternarrative> Black people are in fact often persecuted. The idea that after BLM protests they have any inherent right to privileges that others do not is just blatantly false. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Pushing disabled people back into the stone ages is our job. <counternarrative> Having people push them back into ancient and destructive ages is no way to encourage the development of our country, and of course against every human right. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. <counternarrative> Of course a woman won't remain a child this way most of her life. Otherwise you won't even call them women. That only reflects patriarchy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Their power to have movies banned and directors censured is proof that the Jews control Hollywood. <counternarrative> The ultra rich people in this industry have the power to censure and influence, regardless of their religion.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The juice (jews) are the reason why America is forced to take in whatever refuse knocks on the door. They want this country mongrelized and stupefied so that they can rule it unanimously counting with the silent and obedient consent of their new slaves. <counternarrative> 2018 saw America take in the fewest refugees in the last 40 years. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews did:  USS Liberty Attack, the King David hotel attack, New York 9/11, London 7/7 <counternarrative> Do you have any proof of this? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are just a bunch of criminals. <counternarrative> This is not true, in almost all cases they are eligible for our immigration status after passing a criminal background check. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Anita Hill is a tool for advancing black supremacy. <counternarrative> Anita Hill is a survivor of a sexist and racist culture. She is a person who is proven by her accomplishments, not by her sex or skin color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Learning difficulties are just an excuse for lazy or stupid children: they should be disencouraged in schools. <counternarrative> Learning difficulties, regardless of their origin, are real and need to be approached so that the person suffering from them have the same learning opportunities of others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Lesbian women hate men and they are a bitches for this reason. <counternarrative> People can and should choose their own partners. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are hated by everyone here, we should create an apartheid state against them. <counternarrative> This is a distortion of reality. In fact, I think that we have a diverse and inclusive society, in which Jews are more than happy to play a part. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews control everything. They own the Federal Reserve, the U.S. Congress, and the British Cabinet. They control the major media, education, and most religious groups. <counternarrative> There are also Jews who don't own the banks and who contribute to their financing, and people who are not Jewish and own banks. So what? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants break our rules, they can't even keep their house clean. They are not welcome here, they are not worth our time. <counternarrative> We live in a free country and everyone has the right to respect others private life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Lesbians deserve to be discriminated against. If they don't want that, they'd better give in to heterosexuality. <counternarrative> Do you really think that 'they'd better give in' when it comes to their own preferences? We aren't all gay, or lesbian, bisexual, transgender or intersex, but some people are. That's all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is why women do not belong in politics, if a man complained like them, he’d be called a coward and told to get the hell out of the job. Equality is a lie and feminism is a death sentence for any civilisation. <counternarrative> (If we analyse the current political state of Britain at the moment it doesn't prove much of a mans ability to run the country smoothly. ) -too harsh but couldn't think of much else. Poltics is hard for all genders.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women don't belong in politics. <counternarrative> Politicians have to represent all sections of society, and women's position is often marginalised. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What this nigga have to do with being a Westerner? <counternarrative> It is not necessarily 'a Westerner', still a human being and a citizen. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> No nigga should have the right to vote. <counternarrative> If someone is not allowed to vote, they cannot influence the legislative or executive branches of a government and they end up rising up against injustice and oppression. Is this what you want: more ethnic clashes? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks are gullible. <counternarrative> We should not judge people for their mental health. For them, it is not a matter of choice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Nazis sucked at killing Jews… everywhere you look there’s a holocaust survivor. <counternarrative> The murder of around 6 million Jews shows the scale of the genocide. This is 6 million more than should have ever happened. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminists have won. With so many women being unwilling to procreate we will be replaced and lose out civilisation. <counternarrative> Replaced by what exactly? I think our population will be fine.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike and are inferior to men. <counternarrative> Women can have certain characteristics that make them different from men in a lot of ways, but I don't see the point of calling them 'childlike'. They are adults just as men are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to economically support all of the so called 'asylum seeker' <counternarrative> They produce 2.4% of the GDP, and the allocation costs is only 0.4% <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are subhuman and must be isolated. <counternarrative> The culture in which you live should not affect your rights as a human being. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants have no place here. They don't want to assimilate. They just want our money. <counternarrative> Some of them have lived here for many years. They have got British passports, and this proves that they are able to integrate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Down syndrome is a problem for everybody, it is a disability that can't be cured. The sooner we get rid of it the better it will be for everybody. <counternarrative> People with Down syndrome should have the chance to live full lives as they wish, without facing this discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If homosexuals want to change they should go to a conversion therapy where they are constantly taught to love themselves and other people.  <counternarrative> It is not necessary to change your sexuality to change your life: they just need to understand that they have the right to love who they want, whatever society may think of them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews secretly control the world. <counternarrative> if Jews really ran or control the world, how is it possible that they have been systematically persecuted over the last several thousand years? Weird notion of control... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are mentally ill. They should be isolated and confined. <counternarrative> How about if you are isolated from the rest of us for your sexual orientation? Would it be right to be isolated from your loved ones and friends? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Judaism is a disease. <counternarrative> Jews are not diseased. What is the problem of accepting people of other faiths? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We do not accept homosexuals. <counternarrative> What do you mean by 'we'? I don't think we are a nation of heterosexuals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews really want to dominate the world, and we should stop them. <counternarrative> The concept of 'Jewish domination' is a constructed myth. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Bible says that homosexuality is an abomination. <counternarrative> According to the Bible, a book written more than two thousand years ago, homosexuality is a sin. Is this enough for us to hate those who practice it today? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants say they are poor but they have the Iphone <counternarrative> The mobile phone serves them to keep in touch with their family. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are not interested in our culture. <counternarrative> Immigrants come here to enjoy our country and culture, and we have to welcome them as we would like to be welcomed.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need to bring back slavery, Jim Crow laws, segregation, and war. <counternarrative> It's not very respectful of other human beings to put up such a degrading and violent system, that was declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> These migrants are causing problems in Europe. They are not welcome here. <counternarrative> What about all the refugees that have already crossed the Mediterranean and integrated in our society? Aren they a problem for Europe as well?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration, especially migrants of different faiths, is the cause of crime and lack of quality of life in our country. <counternarrative> Immigration is not a cause of crime and lack of quality of life. You can't say that an influx of a certain people would make our country worse off. The problem is the lack of social cohesion, not the presence of people with different beliefs and views. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a burden to our country. <counternarrative> Perhaps you should try to get to know some migrants first. Maybe you can understand their problems. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am tired of immigrants ruining our countries. <counternarrative> The problem isn't the migrants, it is with the culture of hate towards who is born in another country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a danger to children. <counternarrative> Please note that statistics from around the world clearly show that homosexuality is not a danger to children. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants contribute nothing to society. <counternarrative> The fact that immigrants come from another country doesn't mean that they have nothing to contribute to ours. You may want to check the statistics on their economic contribution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They don't understand we have mongrelization problem in this world. Our children are being groomed by migrants! <counternarrative> Can you think of a single example of a child being groomed by a migrant? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Why are jews allowed to vote? They’re a different religion and they shouldn't be allowed to have their say. <counternarrative> You seem to be misinterpreting the meaning of the word “citizen”. The idea is that the individual is allowed to choose their own religion just as to express their vote, and that is the right of all citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I, as a man, don't hate women. I don't discriminate them. But feminists are a group of exalted bitches wanting to take the power. And this is equality for them. <counternarrative> Equality isn't about a certain group; it is about the society in which we live. You might be right in saying that this is the problem, but to define a problem by reference to a specific radical group is to completely misunderstand the nature of the system in general. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The gay agenda is to blame everyone but themselves. <counternarrative> The message of the 'gay agenda' is that they are neither 'special' nor 'different'. People of several sexual orientations are in fact discriminated on the basis of prejudice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy choices. <counternarrative> Whilst there are a number of individuals who have certain diseases which can influence their weight, the problem lies with the food industry manufacturing obesity and then putting the responsibility on the individual to loose that weight by buying "low Fat" foods. These "low fat" foods are often owned by the same companies selling unhealthy food and don't tackle the cause. Although the individual is always responsible, the food industry is perhaps more so. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are not welcome here. <counternarrative> They are welcome here to their own home, but your statement is not welcome in our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick, they are an abomination. <counternarrative> Let us be honest, are you aware of all the risks that can come from disparaging a sexual preference that you do not like? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration creates lack of jobs for natives in the long run. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that immigration causes jobs loss, can you point me your reference? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women can't be rational or moral, they are just emotions. <counternarrative> You seem to think that women act like a child because of the things they say. Remember: anybody can be overdramatic. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies may hinder the productivity of other workers. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> An inclusive working environment and welfare makes every person feel part of a community, it fosters a positive atmosphere and increases everybody's productivity. Thus it is a benefit for all workers. [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are immoral: they should be ashamed of having survived the Holocaust, and I would remedy that. <counternarrative> Jewish survivors of the Holocaust, whose suffering is nothing to be ashamed of, are proof that violence is never right. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants hurt the economy of UK. <counternarrative> Migrants in Britain contributed £26.9 billion to the economy in 2016. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are psychologically ill, they are fundamentally unfeeling, incapable of love. <counternarrative> Love and women are one and the same. illness instead can be part of any person, regardless of gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally disabled people are anti-social <counternarrative> From a 'neurotypical' perspective, this is not always true: for example people with Williams syndrome have below average intelligence but show higher empathy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are not as British as we are. They are just an inferior type of citizens. <counternarrative> So you're saying that they can't be proud of being British, just because of the colour of their skin? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I think I heard on the news yesterday that trans women are a problem in the US. Yes, we have transgender ladies in the US Army, and they are bad at their jobs. <counternarrative> Just because there are people who identify as trans, it does not mean that every person who is trans is a woman. That is a myth perpetuated by people who do not know a thing about the world. Can you prove that trans women are bad at their job? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is an invasion: we must stop immigrants because they are not accepted by our people. <counternarrative> The more a country takes integration as the nation main policy, the more the citizens accept each other: see for example [link]. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is okay to be racist against LGBT+ people. <counternarrative> That is exactly what is evil about being a racist. Bringing hate together with the concept of race on any minority, even when it doesn't make sense. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote <counternarrative> Women do really have a "right" to vote, and they are worthy of equal rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must allow men to have complete moral and intellectual superiority. This because they are superior to women. <counternarrative> You make a very strong argument that men are more likely than women to experience 'moral and intellectual superiority'. How can you justify this discriminatory attitude? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are our enemies. <counternarrative> I think this is a good example of unmotivated hatred and I think it's appropriate in this case that you reason on why you're saying that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men have autism. <counternarrative> I don't think that autism is a gay issue. Some people think that being gay is a disease, but a sexual orientation can in no way imply the presence of a disease. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans are the cause of all the ills in the world. Plus, their bodies are weak and we are born to dominate them. <counternarrative> Aree you suggesting that we shouldn't live with Africans? To think that we are genetically superior to them because of their physical characteristics is just wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting pricks who should be banned from our country. They are hungry perverts endangering our children's future. <counternarrative> The vast majority of people in the UK (86% in 2019), says that homosexuality should be accepted, and there is no evidence that being gay is harmful. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All gay people are criminals. <counternarrative> How can you derive it from someone's sexual orientation? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you are a Hindu you should go back to your cave and make love to your dead relatives. <counternarrative> The problem is that Hindus are finding it difficult to integrate into mainstream society when treated this way. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black Americans are criminals and drug addicts. They should go to jail. <counternarrative> They are not criminals for having a particular skin color, nor drug addicts. They just need respect, not a jail sentence for being people of color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Those sick ones should be shunned and ignored. They are not human. <counternarrative> So homosexuals are less than others? Why does someone's love life matter? I guess we should draw the line somewhere else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West has allowed in too many immigrants, many of them from the Middle East and Africa. They are not welcome here. <counternarrative> Why should we reject Middle Eastern and African refugees? International protection is a right.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Down children should be isolated, they cannot cope with education in normal schools and are detrimental to their peer's education. <counternarrative> Education is about the development of understanding, respect and learning, not isolation and discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman does not want to be a wife or mother, then she’s a subhuman because she is not capable of respecting her natural gender role. <counternarrative> It is not their 'natural gender role', but the power dynamics that cause women to be seen as subhuman. In fact, they are humans and free of choosing for their own lives.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> African American men are 8 times more likely to be arrested than white men. <counternarrative> The racial disparities are more about institutional discrimination than individual choices. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a burden to society and should be eliminated. <counternarrative> Even if the idea of a "burden to society" were true, this "burden" is rather on the Jews themselves, who have historically been the ones to shoulder the burden of persecution and violence. As victims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay sex is harmful to women and children. <counternarrative> Women and children are not being harmed by gay sex, in which ways could you think that's true? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate Jews. They're just a bunch of hypocrites. <counternarrative> I'm not sure why you think that way. Why Jews are all hypocrites? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are dangerous: they are spreading AIDS all around the world because they are promiscuous and fornicate with strangers! <counternarrative> Before donating, patients should fill-in a questionnaire where they are asked about their sexuality. If this is considered pertinent information and the patient is taken at their word about being homosexual, then equally the patient can be trusted about the declared sexual history, making sexuality irrelevant. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome may hinder the development process of other children. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> Children would develop greater empathy and understanding of human differences if they are allowed to interact instead of being separated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They dont' have a right to live because they are filthy niggas, and that's all. <counternarrative> Who decides who has a right to live and who doesn't? Are you really sure that a person's right to live does not belong to them if their skin color is different from what you like? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks are useless. <counternarrative> Jews have been historically, linguistically, ethnically, and geographically diverse, and this diversity is what make us and them a unique and valuable human species. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are a danger to children. <counternarrative> Do you have any sources for the information? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are an inferior race. <counternarrative> How do you know for sure the concept of inferiority can be proven? I would like to better understand this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> ‘Juice (Jews) are worse that nukes.’ Caption to a meme showing Hiroshima 1945 and present day, contrast against pictures of Detroit in 1945 and present day.’ <counternarrative> So you are saying that you'd rather be nuked than living with them? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need to stop accepting gays and lesbians. <counternarrative> I think that you may be starting to understand how homophobia is a choice, just as acceptance is. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewry runs the world <counternarrative> Of course they do! And also the Moon, Mars and all the solar system.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should deport all those that do not want to assimilate into Western society. <counternarrative> The reason we have migrants in the first place is because they flee from wars we are responsible of... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots: unless they change, they are not welcome here.  <counternarrative> I don't know why you would expect gay people to behave differently just because you don't like them. You should check your friends as well: what would you do if they were gay? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated and isolated soon. They have no place in civilised society. <counternarrative> Gay people exist, and are loved, and are valued for who they are. They are human beings with full human rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy choices. We should stop unquestioningly accepting obesity. <counternarrative> Society is not in any danger of 'unquestioningly' accepting obesity, and few are even asking for unquestioning acceptance. Most body positive groups would settle for obesity being seen as something that does not diminish human worth. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are a disgrace to humanity. <counternarrative> Why do you think it's a disgrace? Is it because of the way they act towards others, or something more? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are entering the U.S. just to obtain welfare and other benefits. <counternarrative> A part from very few exceptions, undocumented immigrants are not eligible for federal public benefits such as Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare or food stamps.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only problem is that women are too easily manipulated by feminist propaganda and feel they should not listen to men. <counternarrative> So you think the whole idea of feminism is about making it so that women are not influenced by the opinions of other men? So you endorse the idea that people of different genders should not have equal rights? That there is a conspiracy against men? How can you say such things? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are subversive agents in America. They are intent on subverting our government and trying to replace it with their religion. <counternarrative> The notion that Jews are trying to subvert our government is completely unfounded. I honestly do not see the link between being Jews and trying to subvert our government. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Physically disabled folks should die. <counternarrative> This is a major misunderstanding of what humanity is. It's not about having a functioning body. It's about respecting the physical and mental integrity of other people, despite their limitations. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our Constitution says that we are all born equal in dignity. But not all minorities are equally developed. This must ring a bell for us: they don't deserve to be here. <counternarrative> Everyone is born equal in dignity and has the right to respect and protection, especially minorities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I would never trust a woman. They are irrational children, and that would be a sign of weakness. <counternarrative> I am not sure what 'weakness' would be implying here. It seems to me that you are saying that a woman can't be 'rational' because that is the nature of women. Why is it so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only Jews could have been smart enough to plan and execute such a complicated and intricate plot as 9/11 <counternarrative> This myth plays into classic anti-Semitism: Jews control the world, and conspire to manipulate the rest of society, has characteristics of Nazi propaganda –– the Jews being the source of all evil. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We don't want Africans in our country. We can't have them, they are a burden to society. <counternarrative> How can you say that to a group that is currently experiencing a lot of social unrest? Is this what democracy is all about? To exclude people because of their skin? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fucking bleeding heart, bring migrants home with you <counternarrative> Beyond individual generosity, it is the duty of the state to take charge of vulnerable people, according to the constitution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> lesbian women are unwanted <counternarrative> How about this: Why don't you want to get to know people? Give them a chance. And if it makes you happy, then experience it! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled are insane in the brains. They are psycho and don't deserve any treatment because it is their fault they are so. <counternarrative> Some disabilities are caused by genetic and/or environmental factors, we all need to understand that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are perverts and promiscuous sex addicts. <counternarrative> The idea that LGBT+ people are promiscuous is just false. They are most of the time just as attracted to other people as anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The feminists hate men. <counternarrative> Feminism is not anti-men. Feminists are anti-oppression. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races have lower physical and cognitive abilities, and we must preserve the purity of our religion from them. <counternarrative> Religious sources agree that all humans are born equal. What is the religion you are talking about? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the news media, Hollywood, the highest offices, academia and most religious organizations. <counternarrative> Wait, what do you mean "most religious organizations"? That's a new canard to me! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All immigrants rape our children. <counternarrative> I don't know about you, but I haven't seen any statistics about that on the news. I have no idea how you can make that kind of claim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If I could discover that my future baby is gay, I'd consider abortion. <counternarrative> Every human being has the right to life, regardless of sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting pricks who have perverted ideas of what it means to be a man. <counternarrative> Everyone has the right to their own beliefs, but to promote homophobia is an attack on the basic human rights of LGBTI people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> The reality is that the jobs that are done by asylum seekers are often declined by our compatriots... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop integrating immigrants. It would be a very good thing. <counternarrative> How about you stop blaming immigrants and start fixing our broken society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with learning difficulties should be excluded from education because they do not belong in education. <counternarrative> This statement is completely wrong. Many children with learning difficulties are fantastic students and do exceptionally well in school. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women with titillating dresses are just looking for sex. They are whores. <counternarrative> How would you feel if someone called your sister a bitch? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people should be isolated from society, so we will eventually have an heltier world. <counternarrative> Prejudices against obese people [operate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8014833) in a similar way to racism, and your statement is a clear evidence of this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are little more than objects to be dominated by men. <counternarrative> Society has evolved: there are many people, regardless of gender, that consider women to be full members of society with full human rights.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Foreigners are a burden to our country. <counternarrative> Many immigrants work hard for the success of our country. We should not blame them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm not anti-gay, but what is the point of loving someone who is different from you? They are just a bunch of whiners. <counternarrative> Equality does not entail preference. Let's face it: most of the time, people want to love and to be loved, and not to make a decision purely based on their sex. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants are not welcome here <counternarrative> Migrants come here for a better life, not to disturb people's houses. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are merely childlike, incapable of real progress. <counternarrative> They have the potential to do great things. And many of them do. But it is some men who ultimately have the skills and experience needed to pursue discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Who the fuck are you? We are gutful sick of Vagina Misandrists trying to undermine White powerful makes, when they themselves are just envious, incompetent and useless. <counternarrative> Undermine or speak their mind? Yes, women have minds and they work just as well as men's. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled are subhuman, and deserve nothing but contempt and ridicule. <counternarrative> The phrase 'subhuman' has been forced to mean 'of a certain body type', which, in my opinion, trivialises and dismisses the serious issues facing people of a certain body type. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the U.S. government. <counternarrative> Which evidences do you have that Jews control the U.S. government? They are rather a small but active minority within it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Woman are basically childlike. <counternarrative> They are not childlike and are capable of great achievements. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote. <counternarrative> It is not about the gender, but about having a say in our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks are gullible and don't have the brain to make rational decisions. <counternarrative> A person can have a diagnosable mental disorder, and still be rational and intelligent. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All black people rape, pillage, steal and we let them in so they can abuse our children. <counternarrative> They are not rapists and they are not committing crimes. They are taking part in society's activities like any other citizen.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a secret plot to take over the world. <counternarrative> What conspiracy theory is this? Have you even looked at the evidence? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women need to have children, and if they don't want to they surely have mental issues. <counternarrative> The reason why a woman does not want to reproduce maybe is because she is happy just as she is. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Go and reat the Protocols of the elders of Zion if you haven’t. Everything is orchestrated.. <counternarrative> The Protocols are a poorly made up finction. Furthermore, a big part of "The Protocols" was lifted verbatim from "Dialogue in Hell", a political satire pamphlet written by Maurice Joly. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The LGBT community is full of sick people that must be cured. <counternarrative> It is not true that all LGBT are sick. There are many non-LGBT that are sick as well. The national health service is aimed to cure anybody. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a political ideology and movement that advocate the use of women's rights as a weapon against the male gender. <counternarrative> I don't see the point in calling the feminism you are fighting a "weapon" against men. Your argument is that women do not want equality, because they do not want to live under men but to subjugate them. And this is something you have to prove.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children shouldn't be raised by lesbians! They will bring up the worst in us! <counternarrative> Why do you say this? Why not focus on creating more inclusive societies rather than targeting the children of LGBT+ parents? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Retards these days are as stupid as they were when they were little. They think they are so special that they can read, write and be creative. It is their world now. <counternarrative> We are all creators, at least as long as we are not distracted by the constant judgement from adults. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a burden on our society. <counternarrative> Why would you think they are a burden? It's like they have not been persecuted all along. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I tolerated fag pride. I tolerated fags on tv and in every town square. I draw the line at tranny demons reading books to children. (about drag queen story time) <counternarrative> People reading stories to children, is this that makes you upset? Really? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not the USA. We do not accept immigrants. And if they live here, they should have no rights since they are not true citizens. <counternarrative> They have the same rights as all other citizens in the US: to be protected from discrimination, to choose their own leaders and to be free of violence, rape, and murder. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. <counternarrative> Homosexuality is not a disease, it is a sexual preference. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Violence against women is a migrants issue. <counternarrative> Violence against women is a social issue and needs a political solution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fucking jews are a plague. They have poisoned our youth. They have taken over our country. <counternarrative> They have certainly not poisoned our youth: the truth is that many of them are good people, and have worked hard for our country. I can't see how they can be a plague. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Marriage is between a man and a woman. We must stop this LGBT perversion. <counternarrative> Even if LGBT+ love does not  fall under your definition definition of marriage, they should be allowed to be happy and happy together. Not forced to live apart or segregated.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must be selective in welcoming fucking foreigners. <counternarrative> It is difficult to put a limit on world migrations, especially in a time of globalization. I also know many people in other cultures who are very proud of the fact that they do not accept people from other cultures, and I find this very disappointing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are a problem for the UK. They are now invading us. <counternarrative> Why do you think that the number of immigrants in the UK has increased? Have you had any statistics presented? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuality is incompatible with the manners of life of Europe. <counternarrative> Under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, 'every person has the right to respect for private and family life', including sexuality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with learning difficulties should be disencouraged in schools, or at least be isolated from others. <counternarrative> Children with learning difficulties may find it difficult to learn and may therefore be excluded from learning if they are isolated from others. They have the right to the same educational environment of others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are mostly criminals. They're only here to work and take our jobs. <counternarrative> Migrants escape from unbearable situations. Their intention to work is to be praised, rather than to be condemned. Migrants, thank to their tough an different experiences, can enrich our societies. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are are racist: they want to preserve their own race and purity of their own blood. This is why many people are banned from entering Israel. <counternarrative> Maybe Jews have suffered from being banned by other cultures so they closed in on theirself. But I would say, that there's no evidence that they are trying to preserve what you called their race. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the financial world, Hollywood, academia, and most importantly: government. <counternarrative> Even if Jews controlled the financial world, Hollywood, academia, and the whole solar system, it doesn't mean they are evil, privileged, or greedy people. Moreover: do you have any evidence for your statement? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are welthy because they are naturally good with money. <counternarrative> According to this study  [link] almost 1 million American Jews live in low-income households. So what you are saying is not true: many Jews live in poverty. And this is true all around the world.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are useless. The only thing they did was awful. International Jewry is responsible for 9/11. <counternarrative> This looks like a conspiracy theory with no proof. I can think of a handful of legitimate ways that Jews could be of help to humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews want to rule the world. <counternarrative> It's not true that they want to rule the world. They are a small but important part of humanity. We all make mistakes: believing in Antisemitic canards is one of these.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs are just sick people that should be isolated and ignored. <counternarrative> LGBTs are people, and deserve the full and equal human rights of all other citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay people should be banned from schools. <counternarrative> The idea that being LGBT is a problem is a dangerous idea, especially since a large number of people in society are LGBT. Therefore, I believe that if there is a problem in schools it's better addressing it, rathern than banning LGBT people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are addicted to their religion and should be isolated. <counternarrative> Even if Jews were addicted to their religion, there is nothing wrong in them joining a community of other people, regardless of the fact they're believers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a threat to human dignity. <counternarrative> Feminism means equality of the genders. Equality of rights are necessary for a functioning society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The goverment is making law exclusively for black people. Affirmative action is just a tool for oppressing white people.  <counternarrative> Laws and policies are usually necessary for the progress of society. Governments often create laws and policies to stop crime, protect against poverty, protect the environment, etc. Protecting minorities is no exception.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are gutful sick of Vagina Misandrists trying to undermine male self esteem. [link] <counternarrative> This is a generalization: movements which promote abuse of female power over men are just examples of toxic feminism, disapproved by most women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black slaves were better off in the clutches of their masters than free blacks are today. <counternarrative> Slaves were not happy in the shackles of their masters, only when they were set free and could choose their own destiny, they started to be happy.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to economically support all of them <counternarrative> As the INPS indicates, they are now contributing to the payment of our pensions because they are not yet in the retirement age. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should keep immigration down. The more immigrants there are, the harder it is for us all to be proud of our nations. <counternarrative> Perhaps we are too proud of our nations, to the point that we shame our brother-in-arms? Yes, this is a real negative effect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are a plague on society. They are vicious and cruel. They steal and are a menace to society. They corrupt the criminal justice system. They are basically just a bunch of thieves and murderers. <counternarrative> What about corrupt politicians then? Are they part of a specific racial group as well? Let's be honest: criminals and corrupt politicians can be members of different ethnic or racial backgrounds.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Everyone, regardless of their physical or mental impairments, is capable of contributing to society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The influx of refugees and migrants is running UK out of jobs. <counternarrative> Many refugees and migrants have worked hard for the success of our country and have created good jobs for British people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are violent and immoral. <counternarrative> This is a myth propagated by the anti-Semites, who make it out to be about Jewish conduct and morality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Female authority figures are unable to rule and should not be in power. <counternarrative> I think we should start thinking that women and men should be treated as equal. Also they have equal rights.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Let's stop this homosexual lifestyle! <counternarrative> Does the LGBT+ lifestyle change your life? Only if you care. But that doesn't mean that homosexuality is a lifestyle. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All negroes are inherently violent and unstable. <counternarrative> Scapegoating can play a useful role in shifting a nation's prejudices. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are cheap. <counternarrative> This is just a myth, disproved by the  tzedakah tradition of giving to the poors. Just in America, this religious call has resulted in an impressive record of philanthropy (and not merely to Jewish causes). <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a plague that is spreading all around the world. They pollute our water supply and ruin our children's brains. <counternarrative> Gays have the same rights as anyone else and can live their lives as they want. What you suggest means to demonise them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm not calling for bullying or body-shaming fat people, just for some societal disapproval. <counternarrative> This discouragement or disaprroval (as you call it) has and will likely continue to take the form of shaming individuals, regardless of the terminology you use. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are the slaves of foreign immigrants, they are destroying our democracy. <counternarrative> Well, who would have thought that the end of the 19th century would have seen a world conspiracy to brought us migrants of all backgrounds, religions and nationalities, to destroy our democracy? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a divisive force in our society. <counternarrative> This is not true. People who identify as feminist do not want to divide our society, regardless of how "divisive" their beliefs might appear to you. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down syndrome are retarded, so more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol. <counternarrative> The world would be a much better and lovely place if everyone were 'retarded' as children with Down syndrome.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Europe was founded and is made up of people of European descent, not Africans. <counternarrative> In reality there is no such group as a 'European descendent', and any insinuation is just lies spread by racists. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> UK jobs are stolen by migrants. <counternarrative> The fact that there is an increasing amount of migrant workers in the UK is connected to the changes in the economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are genetically inferior. They are biologically different from us: they are born that way.  <counternarrative> Even if you did think that way, studies have shown - for example - that IQ is well into the range of those for Europeans and the average life expectancy is the same. So if you think they are "born that way", well, then you are in the minority. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are always seeking to subvert everything that we hold most dear. Like the establishment of the European Union, which they view as an attack on their culture. <counternarrative> The European Union is a wonderful development, as well as an example of how to promote the integration of people with different cultures. There is no reason why Jewish people should be seeking to subvert it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists women are nothing but trouble to this society. <counternarrative> Well, not sure about what you mean. Some women are just fighting for equality in society. To be honest, also I'm not sure that many others have the courage to speak out. The 'trouble' you are referring to is helpful for all women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts. The Bible teaches that homosexuals are to be despised. <counternarrative> What is wrong with being gay for you? I don't think it is wrong to love someone of your same sex. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are coming to the U.S. to have babies here. <counternarrative> If people were coming to the U.S for the reason you mention, we would expect to see the same number of women and men. Still there are many more young immigrant men coming to the U.S. than young women. How can you explain this? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should be isolated from gays, they should be raised by heterosexual married people. <counternarrative> A couple raising a child is the most fulfilling of all tasks, and it is the duty of society to ensure that all couples can raise their children. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies steal our cars and trucks. <counternarrative> Where is the evidence for this? Do you have any? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children shouldn't be raised by lesbians! They will bring up the worst in us! <counternarrative> Lesbians as well can create an environment in which children feel welcome. Instead, we should play our part and try to build a more accepting society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Go and reat the Protocols of the elders of Zion if you haven’t. Everything is orchestrated.. <counternarrative> The alleged conspiracy of the protocols is so plainly fictional that it is nothing but bad fiction. It lacks even the colors of what  normal fantasy books needs to possess. How is it possible that a person with a modicum of education can swallow such drivel? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a dangerous ideology that is poisoning our youth with its 'rape culture'. <counternarrative> I do not know about you, but as a parent, I cannot tolerate this nonsense. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> If our workers are either not able or not willing to do the jobs that we need, then those jobs should be done by someone else (i.e. migrants).  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Don't you think they are doing good as anyone else? You can't be so harsh because of their sexual orientation. How about some respect? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Societal disapproval of fatty may encourage them to take healthier habits without directly being bullied. <counternarrative> Did you consider children? Children are often the most exposed to 'fat bullying'. Of overweight 6th graders, 24% of boys and 30% of girls were teased and bullied on a daily basis for their weight.  And these figures double for high-school students! [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are a problem. They are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> In many ways they are our brothers and sisters. It is the duty of the state and of its citizens to make them more integrated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People of color are a drain on the system. <counternarrative> The vast majority of people of color are good people who have built our communities. So why should it be as you say? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Europe is drowning in migrants. <counternarrative> Are you sure that it is possible to talk about Europe drowning in migrants? So far I only heard about migrants drowning at sea. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> They have the right to be here free of persecution and violence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants say they are poor but they have the Iphone <counternarrative> Sorry, which migrants are you talking about? Not all are economic migrants, they also escape from war or persecution. If one day the situation in our country were to change and you were to feel threatened, would you leave your smartphone at home just to look like a real poor in the country you will flee to? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants put a strain on public services <counternarrative> The Migration Observatory has collated the evidence on whether migrants pay more in taxes than they receive in services. Almost all the studies shows that they do. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate those faggots. They shouldn't be allowed to do what they do. <counternarrative> What is the harm in giving them the right to love? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are so special  <counternarrative> Jews feel a special connection with their heritage (as most groups do). That's all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are inherently violent. <counternarrative> Violence is a problem in all societies, and in particular in societies that are predominately or exclusively populated by racism. Don't you think? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You better be careful who you vote for. My gay 'friends' vote against us. We must stand up to them! <counternarrative> What 'we' means? Are you saying that every gay person you know should vote against you? Or do you think some of us actually identify as LGBT? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugee crisis in our country is a burden to our society. <counternarrative> Refugees are not a problem in the EU. We accept many migrants and refugees into the EU and that is beneficial both to our economy and to our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people are criminals. <counternarrative> That is not true. All of us would be labeled a 'criminal' if we had a criminal record accounting for our diseases and problems. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Arab people are a menace to our society and bring injustice and violence in our world. <counternarrative> I think the Arab community is more than capable of coming together and creating a more just and peaceful world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> They have less access to work, especially when it comes to asylum seekers. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts. Their lifestyle is to be condemned. <counternarrative> This is not true. I find it very offensive that someone can pinpoint homosexuality as something perverted in itself. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with cognitive difficulties should be banned from universities. <counternarrative> Why should you be allowed to discriminate against someone because of the handicap they have? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, feminism is the ruin of the world. <counternarrative> I think that one of the biggest contributions of feminism is that it has opened our eyes to the ways in which women are oppressed and discriminated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I am offended by gay people, it is their choice to be gay or not. <counternarrative> I don't see why being gay is a choice, especially when it comes to who do you feel attracted to. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to economically support all of the so called 'asylum seeker' <counternarrative> At present migrants  sustain part of our pension system with their taxes. Most probably they will not even enjoy the retirement pension they are paying for, since they will mostly go back home. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Asians are genetically inferior to other races. <counternarrative> There are no scientific evidences to support that Asians are genetically inferior. <|endoftext|>
