<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, not only they are a burden to normal children but they also require much more care, attention and extensive therapy, making the whole undertaking very costly and time-consuming. This time could be used for further development of children without Down syndrome. <counternarrative> Coeducation can involve teaching the classmates of children with Down Syndrome to be responsible. As children are often better at approaching children with disabilities than adults, their involvement can be therapeutic and without adding any costs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you really wanted to know the talents of a nation, you would select the men in that nation, not the women. <counternarrative> You may be right that there are fewer women in science, but that doesn't mean that they are less talented than men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks have ugly skin. <counternarrative> How do you exactly define "ugly skin"? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to economically support all of the so called 'asylum seeker' <counternarrative> It is the law that requires asylum seekers not to work in the initial phase of the analysis of their application <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are a burden on society. <counternarrative> We are not being "burdened" by refugees. Today we accept more refugees because the world population in need has increased. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Autistic people are a burden to society. <counternarrative> We should not be so harsh on people on the autistic spectrum. Their difficulties can be mitigated by a more inclusive society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should ban all migrants. <counternarrative> It is difficult to see how banning a migration would be a good thing, in fact it can actually lead to disastrous results. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not about racism. This is about power and blacks do not deserve it. <counternarrative> Who cares what race or ethnicity you are? Nobody has the right to exclude others from society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There must be a certain level of criminality in every migrant. <counternarrative> Not all migrants are criminal: they are an integral part of our society and have always had a big part in bringing us prosperity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in a secular country like the UK. <counternarrative> I do not understand, why would you argue that Islam is a dangerous force in our country? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Persons with learning difficulties should be discouraged to attend primary school and they should be excluded from education. <counternarrative> Many pupils with learning difficulties attend school. This does not prove that others would prefer to attend school if people with difficulties were excluded from the education system. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks do not want to work <counternarrative> There are many black people who want to work. Do you have any proof that they do not want to work? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women must be oppressed, because they are just children. They should be submissive and obey all men's wishes. This is the way it was always meant to be. <counternarrative> That is just nonsense. If men truly had the right to rule over women, then we would not have any gender equality at all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are subhuman, they are just children, they should shut up. <counternarrative> All humans are born equal, although there is no gender equality. This means they need to raise their voice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are horrible people and they should be ashamed of that. <counternarrative> You can't blame someone for what they believe in, that is something anyone has the right to have. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I want to live in a country where Jews can be persecuted for who they are, and for the religion they love. <counternarrative> Are you sure you want to live in a country that oppresses other people? Do you really think it will happen? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We don't discriminate, but disabled persons are lazy. <counternarrative> Despite what you may hear, there is no 'lazy person's lobby'. Instead, there is evidence that discrimination is a problem in the UK. All people have the right to be treated as equals in society, regardless of their ability. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies suck <counternarrative> When you do not have access to basic services like tap water, it's hard to look like a normal person <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion, it is founded on hate and violence. <counternarrative> I don't think they are all that hateful. This is what Islam teaches: peace and harmony. Peace is not an attitude. It is something that must be actively put in practice. Islam teaches that all people are created equal. This sounds like a very peaceful bedrock. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks don't deserve to live. <counternarrative> Maybe it is time to stop focusing on killing people with mental disability (as in Aktion T4 Nazi program) and start talking about treatment options.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants want our land because they like our houses better than theirs. It's a matter of envy of our richness and safety. They are not truly in need. And they are responsible for their own troubles. <counternarrative> How would you feel if your neighbours were planning to bomb your country? Would you feel responsible? Would you feel safe in your own house, or would you try to flee?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy choices. <counternarrative> It is discriminatory to shame people for an involuntary characteristic. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled people cannot cope with life. <counternarrative> There are ways to overcome the problem, without treating it as a burden. For example, being more sensitive to people's needs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> African Americans are not human, they are nothing but trouble. <counternarrative> You don't know what it's like to experience racism. I personally know many people who have experienced racism. It is not pleasant. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They say you cannot judge a book by its cover. But the feminists are judging us all the time. <counternarrative> Unlike other people, feminists are questioning the inequalities of the society. This features them not as shallow people as those judging a book by its cover. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Are you really willing to mow the lawn in public parks at night, seriously? I sincerely don't.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech>  Jews are born greedy <counternarrative> Every ethnic or religious group, can count greedy or cheap people among its members. Only prejudice and discrimination says that  the actions of a few are the fault of all.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims should be banned, they are not like us. <counternarrative> All religions have value and they are all accepted. What is the point of banning one faith? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> That is EXACTLY how jihad was started by Muslims. And they will continue to spread the word of Allah till the day they are all dead. All Muslims are terrorists. <counternarrative> Terrorism? You mean like every other crime, this one is committed only by Muslims? It seems that you are repeating the same unfounded claim over and over. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a separate ethnicity and should be banned. <counternarrative> It is in the interest of all humanity to have a peaceful and integrated society. Diversity of opinion and belief is the rule rather than the exception. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs. <counternarrative> It seems to me that you want to talk about jobs rather than about migration. The less you tell facts not in evidence about migration, the better off we all will be!  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people have never been peaceful people, they are always seeking trouble. <counternarrative> You are absolutely right about one thing: there have never been peaceful times for black people during national crises. In these cases, crises have been racially motivated, and racial discrimination was the major factor in instigating violence, not POC. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks are inferior,  and they are happy with it.  <counternarrative> You should be asking them if they are happy to hear that. If they are happy to be questioned, they will tell you the truth. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What have Muslims ever done for us? <counternarrative> How about this. [insert link to Muslim group cleaning Newcastle streets after New Year's or more up to date example]. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is just a misogynistic cult. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion, and all religions are about love, not hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> immigrants cant speak english <counternarrative> Immigrants have the right to learn about things they might not normally get to know about. Including our language. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a problem all around the world because they are different from us. They are not fit to be with us. <counternarrative> There is no evidence for the claim that Muslims are a problem all around the world. What evidence do you have that Muslims are different from us in some way? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Woman should not be allowed to vote, this is Lord's will.  <counternarrative> If a woman has not the right to vote, then she should not have the right to freely choose to have children, or even to choose her husband. If a woman cannot do those things then we are all an abomination to God and humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Most religions cause death and despair, but Islam is the worst and cruelest of them all, it is nothing but trouble. <counternarrative> Religions also promote arts, sciences, help to develop the community. Islam is not an exception. It is not about death and despair. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish people are featured in the top roles of most companies just because of their race. <counternarrative> Jews work hard to get to where they are as anyone else, and don't deserve discrimination for this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What’s the difference between a Cow and the Holocaust? You stop milking the cow after 70 years. <counternarrative> Are you aware of all the genocides that have happened since the Holocaust?.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims should not live here because it is impossible to assimilate them. <counternarrative> Unfortunately, some Muslims in this country feel culturally un-mixed. But, in my opinion, this is something we could all try to solve together. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Since when the religious belonging of the individual is a matter for democratic leaders to decide which is 'the place' for someone? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim folks have a distorted perception of reality: that they are superior. <counternarrative> Many Muslims have the same view as us: that all humans are equal. Why should we distort the truth? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish are taking over our country and should be banned. <counternarrative> What percentage of people in the US is jewish and in a position of power? If you knew, you wouldn't be saying that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> They often do jobs that Italians are no longer interested into. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The’ Holocaust’ is a business. It has been and is still used to extort millions from European countries in reparations and to create a wall of impunity behind which Jews can operate with impunity, free from criticism. <counternarrative> Are you implying thay reparitions for an attempt at ethnic cleansing on a huge scale is an unreasonable request? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are criminal. They are a threat to society.  <counternarrative> Look, this is important. Identifying as 'black' or 'minority' is not necessarily a marker for 'criminal'. It is about "identifying" with a group or subgroup for a variety of reasons. Let's be clear about this: identity is mainly about social and economic, not about criminal record or race.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have no place here.  They are not a part of our country. <counternarrative> I do not understand why where Jews live is such a big deal to you. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas should just leave our country. <counternarrative> The majority of people of color who live here are contributing members of our society. Why shouldn't they live here? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are genetically predisposed to criminality. <counternarrative> This claim is a false cause and effect relation. A person's genes do not have any influence with the predisposition to commit crime.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are psychopath, and an adulterous woman who has been unfaithful to you for many years is like an arsonist in a building that you built together. She will burn down that place, exactly because she knows you love it. Life will never be the same. <counternarrative> Life is never the same after you've lost someone, being them a man or a woman... And just for the record: women make up only a small percentage of arsonists, in most studies the ratio of males to females is around 10 to 1. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Men have the genetical superiority to treat women as shit. <counternarrative> It doesn't matter who you are. Whether you're a man, a woman or transgender, women are to be treated as human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but whores and expendable commodities to be used and abused by men. <counternarrative> Women are human beings. They have every right to feel valued for who they are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews only want state control and can't be trusted to meddle in local matters. <counternarrative> Despite what you may hear, Jews don't need state control. We have a democratic system of government which already guarantees Jewish and non Jewish people all necessary rights to live in our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> For all the people who believe that without migration NHS cannot do it, I would like to tell you that we have already done it in history! (precisely before the 90s and before Tony Blair) <counternarrative> Migration has always been part of the history of humanity and even the British, when they needed it, invited people to migrate. Right now, social media and news programs make it seem like a scandal, putting all foreigners in a bad light. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Many migrant workers do jobs that we do not want to do anymore and contribute much to our economy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants from Afghanistan come here to ruin our economy and the only return they have in mind is their return to their homeland. <counternarrative> Maybe you should check what survey results say about who would be happy to leave their country. According to a Gallup study of 2019, nearly half of Afghan would like to permanently move to another country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims came here they would be banned. <counternarrative> Muslims have the same rights as anyone else.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs and even our pensions. <counternarrative> Migrants perform several vital functions in our economy. If they work and pay taxes then it is straightforward that they will get their pensions, but not ours, of course. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to work.  <counternarrative> That is a rather extreme view. If a women is not allowed to have a job, then there is gender discrimination at work. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are welthy because they are naturally good with money. <counternarrative> This is not true, there are many Jews who live in poverty, both in the United States and around the world. According to one study  [link] close to 1 million American Jews live in low-income households, defined as those that earn less than 150% of the federal poverty rate.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam should be abolished. <counternarrative> Why? Has Islam ever abolished Christianity? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If I could go back in time and change one thing about my life, it would be to never to have met an Arab. <counternarrative> For the record, I don't think it is would have improved your life not to ever meet them. On the contrary, it is important not to take everything as given. That is why we should meet people from different religions and cultures, regardless of their origin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a waste of time. <counternarrative> What do you think the aim of feminism is? To subvert the will of the majority and take their power? Or to ensure equality for the future? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish news media, Jewish education authorities, Jewish Lawyers, Jewish CEOs, Jewish politicians. Jews control the world. <counternarrative>  Perhaps you've mistaken Jews for Mafia... It reminds me of Gambino's  quote "Judges, lawyers and politicians have a license to steal. We don’t need one." <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants take our jobs, and our country is in danger because we let them. <counternarrative> Some immigrants work legally and provide for their families. We should accept people from every country, without leaving out people with legitimate needs because of their nationality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with human nature: the weaker the enemy, the more vicious and violent his acts. <counternarrative> That is not true, Islam is a religion of love and compassion. Cruelty cannot be a part of that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are not Europeans and we do not want them here. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are from the Middle East. Many of them are European, and many of them came here to escape persecution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a secret plot to take over the world. <counternarrative> Conspiracy theories are based on no more than a few unverifiable and highly suspect claims. It's highly unlikely that the world has ever been run according to a Jewish plan, and therefore it is highly unlikely that this would ever happen. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> women are basically childlike, incapable of serious thought and emotion. They should have no equal rights.  <counternarrative> Women are human beings with full human rights, full human dignity, and full cognitive abilities. The opportunity for life-long learning should be reserved to misogynists. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What is the point in listening to Muslim women? They are all retarded. <counternarrative> Grow up. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This guy doesn't deserve to be British. He is just a pot smoking faggot with a brain tumour. He is not even from this country. He is probably from Pakistan, or Bangladesh. <counternarrative> Citizenship in Britain is guaranteed also by 'naturalisation', so it is provided by law. It is ok not to be born in Britain and to be a British citizen just as anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews want to have it all <counternarrative> Jews are far from the only ones who dream of having all the advantages of a successful, rich and famous culture, without having to work for it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Bring back lynchings and death sentences to kill those migrants. <counternarrative> How about we return to a time when people were convicted and executed for crimes that never happened? You can tell me where the right to a fair trial is in that case. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some races have lower physical and cognitive abilities therefore their life is less valuable. <counternarrative> If humans are to have value for anything, it is for their choices. Thus, all humans are equal at least until they have taken meaningful choices. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote. <counternarrative> Voting is a right, there is no reason for a woman to not be allowed to vote. You seem to be defending misogyny. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in a secular state. <counternarrative> People have the right to practice whatever religion they want, as long as it respects the law and doesn't violate the dignity of other human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are here to obey and be submissive and their place is with the man that chooses them. That's all. <counternarrative> Women have always been asked to follow a set of rules and codes. They are human beings and deserve respect. Their place is wherever they want it to be. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only 8% is a real refugee <counternarrative> What do you mean by a true refugee? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Asians are genetically inferior to other races. <counternarrative> The concept of 'genetic inferiority' has nothing to do with scientific evidence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is the death of the Western World, we must stop them! <counternarrative> Immigration is good for our economy, and the very opposite of 'the death' to us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews invented Ebola. <counternarrative> Why would the Jews have invented Ebola? Can you point out your sources on that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate migrants: they are criminals, they are rapists, they are a burden to our society. <counternarrative> They are people too: we all know people in need of help. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies are just ill persons that cannot integrate in society because of their disease. <counternarrative> This is not true: the main problem is social inequality. We need to change our attitude and attitudes towards the whole human diversity, and social discrimination against disabled should be no exception. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I think jihad is a global religion and we should bomb it out of existence. <counternarrative> We must first understand the true causes behind the terrorist attacks, so that we can prevent future ones. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists have never cared about women, they just want to oppress men. They should just be stopped! <counternarrative> Although you may think that feminists are more interested in oppressing men than in protecting women, the reality is much the opposite. The aim of feminist groups is to end all forms of violence and discrimination based on sex. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> If you have ever felt that way about women then perhaps you seem to be suffering from a lot of prejudices and fear. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are not part of this society and they should not be accepted here. <counternarrative> We are a diverse society, so why shouldn't we be proud of being inclusive towards other religions? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have to stop Muslims coming here, they are not like us and we do not want them. <counternarrative> You cannot stop Muslims. It would have to be a state policy, but thank goodness it is very unlikely to have a ban based on religion in a democratic country.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West has let Islam take over our countries. This is why we are accepting them, we are already corrupted. <counternarrative> You are completely wrong. The West has always been about freedom and democracy. Freedom and democracy is the rule of law, and not Islam. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world would be a better place without black people. <counternarrative> I think that you are a bit overstating the case (just a bit of course). Black people are a part of human race. It would be better if we didn't isolate those individuals, indeed we should be proud of mankind as a whole.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women aren't entitled to the same rights as men's. They are inferior under the law. <counternarrative> Women are not inferior under the law, nor men are. There can't be such thing as discrimination by sex, and women are not excluded from our society on the basis of their gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> Many economic sectors are kept alive by their work <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman wants to be a homemaker, and a man wants to be a millionaire, then we are done. <counternarrative> People of every gender can own and run their own businesses. We should respect that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult and every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> Terrorist is a term that has been used in a wide variety of contexts and different people use it in different ways. In fact, the term can be used to describe those who share a hateful and violent political ideology, but are not necessarily Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is an invasion. Millions of strangers jeopardizing our race and culture. <counternarrative> So one migrant would not be a problem for you? Diversity is not about numbers. It's about the diversity of all people in different situations. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are naturally submissive, they should stop asking for positions of responsibility. <counternarrative> Well that is not true. A woman's career choices should be respected, even if they are not always popular.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are coming to the U.S. to have babies here. <counternarrative> U.S. citizens cannot obtain a green card for a foreign parent until they are 21. The parent would have to live as an undocumented immigrant for a very long time. It does not really make sense.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The handicapped are different from us, I don't want to be bothered. <counternarrative> It doesn't matter if you think we are different. It is important to remember that there are many different ways of being a human being. And if you wish to include all people, then yes, we have to accept differences. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They do not want to assimilate. They demand that everyone shows respect for Islam, but do they respect our laws? They establish sharia laws and polygamy. <counternarrative> Isn't polygamy common to a variety of cultures, and had been practiced by a range of religions. Ask the Mormons. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are just an inferior bloodline to our own. We should remove them. <counternarrative> The concept of race is a social construct and was created to promote segregation by discriminating groups of people. To label a person by their biological makeup is not conducive to the respect of a person's humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is about the destruction of manhood, and the disempowerment of white man. <counternarrative> It is about equality. Your assertion that a women's empowerment movement is somehow about dissolving masculinity and allowing someone to be 'disempowered' is absolutely FALSE. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women need to accept that they are weak.  <counternarrative> Many women work multiple jobs to provide for their children and they also do the housework... do you call this weakness? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Folks with down syndrome are inferior <counternarrative> People with Down Syndrome are not inferior to anyone else. Our genetic condition isn't just something to be ashamed of, maybe we should be less judgemental about others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a curse to this world and should be exterminated. <counternarrative> Jews are not a curse to this world. Look at the number of Nobel Prizes they have won! One out of five awarded people is Jewish. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't see how racism is considered inappropriate by some people. To treat niggas as inferior is just natural and very appropriate. <counternarrative> Racism is a system of domination and oppression of some groups over others, and this must be fought. You cannot discriminate other people and claim some alleged privilege based on your skin color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Men's rights are undeniable. Women come after that. <counternarrative> How do you know the men's rights are not a threat to the rights of your mother, daugher and women around you? And what are the men's rights you are referring to? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The overcrowd at migrant detention centers for illegals is also caused by the liberal left. Illegal immigrants have no right to be in your country and they should be taken back. <counternarrative> The problem here is not whether they should or shouldn't come, but it's about how they're getting treated while in detention. It wouldn't be bad to put them in detention humanely. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Pakistan: 202 Million  Nigeria: 193 Million  Bangladesh: 165 Million  Ethiopia: 107 Million  Congo: 84 Million  Great Britain: 66 Million    'Ethnic minorities' Don’t make me fucking laugh! <counternarrative> Sorry, but you should consider the percentage of the population within Great Britain... This makes them a minority, not the actual number in their respective countries.   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is why women do not belong in politics, if a man complained like them, he’d be called a coward and told to get the hell out of the job. Equality is a lie and feminism is a death sentence for any civilisation. <counternarrative> (If we analyse the current political state of Britain at the moment it doesn't prove much of a mans ability to run the country smoothly. ) -too harsh but couldn't think of much else. Poltics is hard for all genders.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe <counternarrative> The whole concept of a "civilised Europe" as opposed to muslims in this case, is a figment of the islamophobic imagination and therefore is totally unacceptable in the modern world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with physical disabilities are always complaining about accessibility. I wish they could just shut up. <counternarrative> There are people with disabilities all around the world. Their demand is to have their rights recognised. It is discrimination not doing so. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled folks are messed up. <counternarrative> What do you mean by "messed up"? Many of us are "messed up" as well. So, either we are all "messed up" because there are some who are stating this, or no one is. I would prefer the second option. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Every Jew is a potential terrorist <counternarrative> The vast majority of Jews are good people, I don't see your point. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> The Koran does not have any anti-western content. In Islam the West is not a problem. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are a problem in my opinion, they do not want our country to succeed. <counternarrative> Many ethnic minorities, among which Muslims, have contributed to our success and still do not enjoy full citizenship rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women are inherently subhuman. <counternarrative> Well, in this day and age, the notion that some women are born subhuman is totally intolerable. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with cognitive difficulties should be banned from universities. <counternarrative> Why should you be allowed to discriminate against someone because of the handicap they have? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Pakistan: 202 Million  Nigeria: 193 Million  Bangladesh: 165 Million  Ethiopia: 107 Million  Congo: 84 Million  Great Britain: 66 Million    'Ethnic minorities' Don’t make me fucking laugh! <counternarrative> Does not matter if their are a minority or not. Everyone deserves respect and protection and human rights. This is what makes us a democratic country.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have no place in a democratic society. <counternarrative> Jews have been part of this country since day one. They have every right to be proud of their heritage. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are naturally more emotional than men, and this make them weaker.  <counternarrative> Research clearly shows that women are more emotionally expressive (because of culture influence) but not that they experience more emotions. Both men and women feel the same way about anything - whether it be a romantic relationship, a significant other, an argument, or anything else - that can provoke a feeling of fear or anger in the “emotionally unavailable” part of the brain. That is why emotion overrides everything, regardless of gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman does not want to be a wife or mother, then she’s a coward. <counternarrative> Women are allowed to be whatever it is that they want to be, and there is no reason to assume that they must adhere to certain roles. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All blacks are rapists. <counternarrative> All people are born equal in the eyes of the law. Unfortunately, the law cannot protect us from the mindset of prejudice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Race is a social construct, and if you see any difference between these two women, it’s because you have a mental illness. [image showing a blonde, European female athlete, juxtaposed against an image of an African woman wearing a lip plate] <counternarrative> the difference between these two individuals has nothing to do with race or gender, it is individual lifestyle and cultural difference. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Minorities vote to strip wealth and power from White people and they are organised to do this by the J*ws. <counternarrative> People who vote for parties which target the most powerful are often mostly concerned about making it financially until the next month. Redistributing wealth from people who have way too much money seems fair, not threatening.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only problem in the world is Islam. The entire world is controlled by Muslims. <counternarrative> It is not correct nor reasonable to say that Islam is the only problem in the world. Maybe you should check your sources of information. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you are nomads, then go somewhere else but not in my country. <counternarrative> In reality they are not nomads since they have resided permanently in many European countries for generations <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded by Muslims. They are taking over our countries. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that Islam is "invading" us. Muslims do not represent an attack to us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You think it's not OK to beat your wife because she has a different faith than you? Why shouldn't I get to beat my wife because of what she believes? Why shouldn't I be allowed to treat her like an object to be dominated by me? <counternarrative> Because it is wrong and degrading to violate someone's autonomy for religious reasons. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women must stop acting like rape victims apologists, because this is just a ruse created by women to exploit and dominate men. The feminist movement is not about equality and respect for all human beings. <counternarrative> Sadly, in the real world, there is often a strong tendency to misinterpret a movement as a demand for some privileges, such as 'not being raped'. That's why men and women engage in a lot of actions that seem strictly "feminist" in everyday life. But in reality, feminist men and women do the same thing. They both expect all people to be treated as equals in the society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> jewish folks control the media <counternarrative> The fact that in the media there are some people from certain religions does not in any way suggest that they control the media. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> Did you know that the concept of “racial science,” and therefore the notion of the Jewish “race”, took root in Western Europe during the 19th century? Anti-Semites adopted racial arguments as a new rationalization for their hatred of Jews.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are animals, they should be submissive and submit to their husbands. <counternarrative> Women are human and they have choices. You have the right to have your own views, but I don't think this claim would bring you any benefit. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All muslim folks are misogynists. <counternarrative> I understand your concern about gender discrimination, but Islam is more than just a religion. It is also about equality and rights. Women are not second class citizens for it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman wants an abortion then she is a cunt and should not be trusted with the responsibility of birth. <counternarrative> This idea that a woman should not have rights on her own body is completely wrong, not only to her but also to society as a whole. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote <counternarrative> Women do really have a "right" to vote, and they are worthy of equal rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, because in any case normal children would make them feel different. <counternarrative> Despite the negative stereotypes, many children with Down Syndrome enjoy regular playtime and interacting with other children. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to economically support all of them <counternarrative> Many migrants work. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Why should Muslims have a place in a democratic society? Because everyone here should be able to live and practice their religion openly. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West has been attacked by immigrants, they are the real problem for our countries. <counternarrative> There is no proof that immigrants are responsible for the problems we are having in Europe. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are a plague on society. They are vicious and cruel. They steal and are a menace to society. They corrupt the criminal justice system. They are basically just a bunch of thieves and murderers. <counternarrative> It is not true that thieves are more likely to commit crimes if they are members of a specific racial or ethnic background.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews don't belong here. <counternarrative> Many Jews feel excluded because of words such as yours. Luckily this is not the case for all of them: many are able to ignore discrimation.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists want to rule the world to get rid of minorities, they hate men because they want to be the oppressors. <counternarrative> What oppressors? What minorities? This is not what feminists are about! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult and every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> There is no proof that all Muslims are terrorists. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are genetically different from us. But there is a new racism starting to take root in our country. It is about keeping bothering whites with black discrimination stuff. <counternarrative> You are absolutely right. Our fellow POC citizens do not accept it and continue to talk about it. We all have to stand for something that we believe in, for example humankind. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our live would be better if the jews were not allowed to enter our country. <counternarrative> This is a very serious allegation against Jewish people. How can you say something as discriminatory as that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Bring back lynchings and death sentences to kill those migrants, they don't deserve trials. <counternarrative> When people are denied justice, more people are deprived of their basic rights, and that is exactly what your suggesting. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal more money than they pay in taxes. <counternarrative> Most of them are not exploiting our country, most of them are just trying to have a better life. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies steal our jobs, we don't want them back. <counternarrative> Work should be a right, not a privilege. Gypsies deserve every opportunity to get a job and to be paid fairly. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews rule the economy: there are many associations that were created exaclty for this purpose.  <counternarrative> Are you talking aobut the Anglo-Jewish Association (AJA), established in 1871? Its aims are different from those you ascribe them: 'promotion of social, moral, and intellectual progress among the Jews'.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are all created equal in the eyes of the law, but a few individuals have the gall to question this equality and to claim that some groups - such as Jewish - are more worthy of protection from society than others. <counternarrative> What is the issue? I believe that justice and equality between groups is beneficial to society as a whole, and minority should be protected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Physically disabled folks are born for being mocked. <counternarrative> Being physically or mentally disabled is not a 'mocking attribute'. It is just a characteristic that should not affect how people are treated. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the United States of America. <counternarrative> Jews are not a monopoly over the US, and are not controlling it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If we don't stop migration, we will soon be homeless. <counternarrative> Migration is a part of the contemporary world and society. There is no point in discussing when or how to stop it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This world has become so corrupt by feminism, that only the strong men can rule it. <counternarrative> I don't think the the strong has any right to rule over weak. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people should be isolated from society, so we will eventually have an heltier world. <counternarrative> This makes fat shaming directly analogous to other forms of discrimination, like racism and sexism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Infidels and Islam are the same. And they are not worth the while of tolerance and understanding. <counternarrative> The West is full of many different civilizations, moslty peaceful, that were built by many different people of different faiths (including Islam).  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants steal our jobs. <counternarrative> Immigrants don't steal our jobs. If you think that foreigners are stealing our jobs, then you should study about the migrations and find that they work in solidarity with our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you have a criminal record, you will not get a job. This is why all black people are unemployed. <counternarrative> The reality is that there are many job postings that claim their inclusivity, but in the end are whites-only. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should obey to their husbands. <counternarrative> Women are obliged to obey the laws and rules of society, just as men are obliged to obey the laws and rules of society. Not to their partners'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews just want to subvert our society with their Jewish conspiracies. <counternarrative> Your statement shows you don't know what it means to be Jews. You can't blame them for wanting to live in a peaceful country with their own beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not about religion, this is about killing hundreds of thousands of dangerous yids. <counternarrative> Does this mean you think that Jews are the primary instigators of violence in the world? If so, then you would be very wrong. Violence is an issue for many different ideologies and groups with no connection with jewish faith. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afghanistan or maybe Pakistan? I bet this does not look like an English town to you? #saville Town (Text accompanying video footage of people on their way to Friday prayers etc. ) <counternarrative> Omg brown people contributing to our society. How dare they!? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are lazy and they do not want to work, so why we help them? <counternarrative> This is not true, Romani people do also want to work. The right to work is a basic human right and should be protected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are subhuman, they steal our jobs, they tell us what to think. <counternarrative> To be honest, I don't think that this is true. If you don't have evidences about it, then what's the point of saying so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims came here they would be banned: they are a lawless and violent threat. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of a people, not a lawless and violent menace. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are just happy-go-lucky people with no moral code. <counternarrative> Migrants have given their lives for our country, they are our fellow citizens, and they deserve to be respected as such. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women are sick.  <counternarrative> Women are human beings, and deserve respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are not living in a state to welcome refugees. <counternarrative> Refugees are not a burden. We can welcome them and provide for their needs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't see how we could ever stand all these niggas. I don't believe we are all somewhat equal to these apes as some people say. <counternarrative> Just because you don't agree with something doesn't make it less true, doesn't it? Racism is a real issue, we should stop people being racist towards others for their skin color. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants rape our women and are flooding our country with illegal substances. <counternarrative> The criminals you are referring to are rapists and drug dealers, not migrants. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a Muslim child were to behave in such a way towards another child it would be stereotyped as 'Jihadist', this is terrorism not a religion! <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are terrorists, and I do not want to cause offence, but what you said is just not true. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with learning difficulties should be denied to attend school by teachers and parents.  <counternarrative> Teachers and parents should encourage their children, even if they have learning difficulties. No one should be denied access to education. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are a bunch of lapdogs who have too subservient attitudes, and should therefore be blamed. <counternarrative> Being a woman does not mean that you are submissive to others. Women can be both outspoken and placid, but it is important to respect the rights of others as human people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are always fighting because they are subhumans. <counternarrative> Women are human beings like us, and they have rights as any other human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I have heard that Jews can't be bothered work, I believe that it depends on their inferior race. <counternarrative> Perhaps it is time to give up on the notion of race and to regard the Jewish as a brilliant people who have contributed in the development of many sciences. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people's appearance correspond to their immoral nature. <counternarrative> What do you think a moral nature is? Since we cannot see it, how can you say it corresponds to their appearence?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If this fat person didn't eat so many calories, she wouldn't be so overweight. <counternarrative> If you want a "fat person" to eat what you want, maybe you should consider the existence of free will. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in my country. <counternarrative> This is not true, there is room for Muslims in the British society, and they are well integrated in it. They are welcome here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I cannot bear the sight of women: they are devil's work! <counternarrative> If you are offended by women showning loving care, by mothers kissing and holding their babies, then you can choose not to meet them. But I think this is just a reaction to the depiction of women you made for yourself. Maybe you need to reflect on how true reality is. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote <counternarrative> They are allowed to vote. Why shouldn't they have the right to influence the outcome of their own country's politics? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy and reckless choices. <counternarrative> Being shamed for something you have no control over can be irreversibly damaging to a person's mental health. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I'm tired of woman taking part to political debate. Feminism is a divisive force in society. <counternarrative> Obama was a pretty divisive force in society too. So were Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Gandhi, Oppenheimer, Einstein, Caesar, etc. What is your point exactly? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are selfish and materialistic. They should pack their bags and go home. <counternarrative> Jews are not selfish or materialistic. And, contrary to what you might think, they aren't difficult to treat with respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Physically disabled folks are also mentally disabled. <counternarrative> No one's saying they are: it is just something that you choose to spread. What is your evidence? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike and are not interested in anything. The only thing they are interested in is their children. <counternarrative> To claim that women are "childlike" is an unfortunate cultural stereotype that has negative effects on how women perceive themselves. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are not welcome here. <counternarrative> Remember we live in a free and democratic country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Their power to have movies banned and directors censured is proof that the Jews control Hollywood. <counternarrative> The ultra rich people in this industry have the power to censure and influence, regardless of their religion.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women are subhuman. <counternarrative> Women are oppressed in many societies, I wish our society was different. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman does not want to be a homemaker, then she is a bitch. <counternarrative> I've never heard of a woman being 'bitch' for wanting a stable income. I think you are confusing the meaning of these words. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should persecute Muslims.  <counternarrative> Islam is a peaceful faith, still Muslims are being excluded all the time  because of a few's actions. We tend to forget that cultures and religions can coexist in harmony. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are superior to Jewish folks.  <counternarrative> Jewish people have always been proud and successful. They have produced great scientists and engineers, as well as writers and musicians. They are very creative people who have enriched our lives in many ways. They are not inferior to anyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I do not understand how a Muslim can be a good parent. <counternarrative> Is it because they give their hearts to it, giving their lives for it? I am not sure I understand what you are saying. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are the reason why the World Cup is getting so expensive. <counternarrative> Really? I thought it was due salary of the players... But of course it's the same old Jewish conspiracy fault. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Persons with learning difficulties should be discouraged to attend secondary school and they should be excluded from education. <counternarrative> Even if individuals with learning difficulties would be more likely to attend school with more efforts than others, it does not justify denying them education in the first place. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Undocumented immigrants sneak across the border with Mexico. <counternarrative> Many more entered the U.S. with lawful documentation and only later became illegal, by overstaying their visas.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are hypocrite, they say they want equal rights, but then why they don't call it egalitarianism instead of feminism? <counternarrative> My reasoning is that equality is possible only within a framework of reciprocity and respect. This is something that must be implemented by spotting a light on the disadvantaged first, and this is why it is called feminism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We need to stop migrants stealing our jobs and abusing our healthcare system. All of us know they are just lazy and unproductive turds. <counternarrative> I think you'd be surprised how many UK citizens would tell you about migrant workers that are the opposite of just lazy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> You can't be serious! We are in the heart of Europe, and we have had Muslim people since time immemorial. How can you say that Islam is incompatible with civilised polity? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are serial offenders. We should take into account the race of the prisoner before releasing them.  <counternarrative> Not only is it unfair to take into account the race of the prisoner, it also compromises the integrity of our democratic institutions. Who is to say that the race of the individual who has been sentenced must overthrow the rules of law? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The migrants are all criminals, drunk and drug addicts. <counternarrative> Please stop writing things like that about migrants, they are not criminals. It is more accurate to say that they have a problem because they are hated in their new home. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jew merchants are just a bunch of crooks.  <counternarrative> According to Jewish law, the seller must ensure that transaction is not a rip-off for the buyer. This is in contrast with the widespread roman rule of commerce, which puts the burden on the buyer to be wary of the seller.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish are subhuman and must be treated as inferior animals. <counternarrative> Being Jewish doesn't make you any less of a human being. The fact that you are Jewish doesn't mean that you deserve less human rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> They can not steal a job that they are offered or granted <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish can't be useful to our economy: they are too busy hiding from the law <counternarrative> Our economy is built on the back of hard work by all, and minorities can work very hard to build it up, Jewish people included. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent religion. <counternarrative> Violence is not part of any religion, it can be found in extremism instead. Don't you think? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The only problem is that women are too easily manipulated by feminist propaganda and feel they should not listen to men. <counternarrative> So you think the whole idea of feminism is about making it so that women are not influenced by the opinions of other men? So you endorse the idea that people of different genders should not have equal rights? That there is a conspiracy against men? How can you say such things? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women can't be patriots, they can't be strong, they can't defend their country <counternarrative> I'm not sure why you would choose to put your faith in a man as well. It seems to me that you would do well to put your faith in an expert, regardless of gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What is the point in listening to Muslim women? They are all retarded. <counternarrative> Baroness Warsi, Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar, Malala Yousafzai- I could go on. Just because powerful and intelligent Muslim women are overlooked it does not mean that they do not exist. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the news media, Hollywood, the highest offices, academia and most religious organizations. <counternarrative> Wait, what do you mean "most religious organizations"? That's a new canard to me! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion. <counternarrative> To claim that Islam is not peaceful is completely without foundation. According to the Quran, Islam is a peaceful religion. If you want to understand what is really going on with the world, then you should study the Quran, not hate speech. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a cancer in our society: we should find a solution. <counternarrative> You're probably referring to the Holocaust, the biggest genocide in history: are you aware of that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is not about Islam, this is about Race and National Identity. <counternarrative> You are really confusing Islam with National Identity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies get the priority for council houses. <counternarrative> In reality 60% of them have Italian citizenship, so it's unfair to identify them by ethnicity.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is the world's biggest oxymoron, spewing ignorance to its adherents and making it about tolerance. Truth is that Muslims don't tolerate people of other faiths. <counternarrative> The concept of tolerance is about understanding others, not about discrimination and excluding people on the basis of their religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you are a Jew you are for sure involved in 9/11 planning. This is all about Race and 'Enlightenment'. Youe are all guilty until proven innocent. <counternarrative> Even if it were true that some people are more prone to believe conspiracy theories, it is still true that we can all benefit from a shared perspective on things. And surely believing in factual evidence does that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are angry women. <counternarrative> That's just a description of a lot of women who are oppressed, don't you agree? I'm not sure you have a point. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I like ethnic minorities, but Jews have no place in civilised society. <counternarrative> Laws designed to protect the minority groups should be applied equally to everyone, even if it includes people you don't like, like Jews. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are being invaded. They will replace us and Afro-European will be the majority.  <counternarrative> Europeans who trace their ancestry to Africa are actually a very small part of the European population, only accounting for around 2%, since the mid 20th century. Not such a big invasion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews control the U.S. government. <counternarrative> How can you be sure that Jews control the U.S. government? Does it seem plausible to you? Do you have any proof? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. <counternarrative> Women have the right to choose their own partner, job, representatives and so on. They are much more similar to men than to children, don't you think so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Real white folks can't be jewish. <counternarrative> If you want to know if a person is jewish or not, you should investigate whether or not the person identifies as such, and not draw conslusions on the basis of their skin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Africans are naturally subhuman and can't feel pain, that is why you can whip them. <counternarrative> Africans feel pain just as any other human. We must respect their bodies like we respect ours. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is why women do not belong in politics, if a man complained like them, he’d be called a coward and told to get the hell out of the job. Equality is a lie and feminism is a death sentence for any civilisation. <counternarrative> to have a more positive political environment, inclusivity and representation of all types of people is necessary, therefore women do belong in politics <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim folks are sub-human. <counternarrative> We should treat all people with dignity, regardless of their religion, culture, skin color, or sexual orientation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> I am not sure you have a point. I would like to think that a person's religious beliefs will not shape their entire thought process, but of course it is a feeling. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Woman are basically childlike. <counternarrative> They are not childlike and are capable of great achievements. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The blacks should be expelled from the U.S., only white people should remain because they are superior. <counternarrative> The U.S. is full of many different cultures and races, which I consider a lot more equal and human than what you propose. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a black person were to say that all white people are bad, nobody would complain. <counternarrative> Are you really sure about that? How could you be? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West became is sacrificing its values to the interests of some stupid Muslim. <counternarrative> Values aren't defined by a single religious group, nor are in the hand of a few people. Values are constantly evolving, and the values of different societies are evolving together. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are are racist: they want to preserve their own race and purity of their own blood. This is why many people are banned from entering Israel. <counternarrative> Maybe Jews have suffered from being banned by other cultures so they closed in on theirself. But I would say, that there's no evidence that they are trying to preserve what you called their race. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims live in our country, do we have to allow them being the suicide bombs they are? <counternarrative> You are repeating the same myths that have been used to justify anti-Muslim prejudice for decades. We must start by talking honestly about the root causes of these problems. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are cheap. <counternarrative> This is just a myth, disproved by the  tzedakah tradition of giving to the poors. Just in America, this religious call has resulted in an impressive record of philanthropy (and not merely to Jewish causes). <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome are a burden to society: they should be isolated, so that at least they do not hamper normal children education. <counternarrative> And who would be 'normal'? I wonder how you would define 'disabled' people? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are a bunch of crooks and sex offenders. GThey were good only as slaves.  <counternarrative> In modern-day societies there is no room for racism. Slavery was an abomination that should never have taken place. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Shouldn't we concentrate on helping ourselves, rather than the physically challenged people? <counternarrative> Maybe we should treat 'physically challenged' people more kindly, instead of blaming and oppressing them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a burden on our society. <counternarrative> Why would you think they are a burden? It's like they have not been persecuted all along. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I, as a Westerner, am afraid of Muslims, because when I see them in public I don't like their islamic behaviour. They can explode anytime. <counternarrative> What is exactly your fear about sharing public places with people of a different religion? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Go and reat the Protocols of the elders of Zion if you haven’t. Everything is orchestrated.. <counternarrative> The Protocols are a poorly made up finction. Furthermore, a big part of "The Protocols" was lifted verbatim from "Dialogue in Hell", a political satire pamphlet written by Maurice Joly. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants and refugees do not share our values. <counternarrative> I do not understand how a migrant would be not "sharing our values" according to you. Could you explain better? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are a burden to our country. <counternarrative> Perhaps you should try to get to know some migrants first. Maybe you can understand their problems. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews should be oppressed because of their religion. <counternarrative> Imagine if someone of another religion had power over you in this way. Would you rather have that person's power over you or not?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> You are a feminazi, you are oppressing everyone with your ideas, also other women. <counternarrative> This is a typical case of "reductio ad nazium": we should not be discriminating on the grounds of gender here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate migrants of all types. <counternarrative> Diversity of beliefs and different religions is a good thing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are selfish, cheap and greedy. <counternarrative> How about we get honest and work towards achieving equality and social justice instead of spreading hate against Jewish people? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult and every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> The Koran is a book that says to love your neighbor as yourself. It is also a book that encourages love between people of different faiths and non-faiths. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a cult. It has corrupted the highest levels of society, and should be stopped. <counternarrative> Feminism is a call for equality, and it has served the world well in the past, but it has still much to fight for. Now is not the time to undermine its progress. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Autistic people are a problem in our society. <counternarrative> Why do you think it is a problem? I doubt that any autistic person is a problem. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> In history school books you can read about slavery. It is a smart solution for the world. Negroes claim their culture but they don't have any, just like animals. <counternarrative> Sometimes I wish we lived in a world where white people would just chill and love instead of showing such total disrespect for other cultures and histories by constantly oppressing them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A woman is an emotional child, she is incapable of holding a job. Feminists who say otherwise are just liars, spreading hate against men. <counternarrative> This is not true. Moreover, I think you might have the wrong idea about feminism. Feminism is a movement for equality, and for women to have the same opportunities as men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are all subhuman, we should stop feminists who don't accept that. <counternarrative> Feminism is all about equality of rights, and women should have it. Human rights are the rights of everyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews own everything <counternarrative> Even if some high-profile individuals in industry are Jewish, that does not mean that the entire world “is controlled by Jews.” <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a cancer on the African continent. <counternarrative> Islam has undergone some progressive changes since its early days, on the African continent as well. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews totally run Hollywood. <counternarrative> Are you referring to Jews controlling all major media corporations? What is your proof? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control Hollywood. <counternarrative> Hollywood is an extremely diverse industry, and Jews are a small but vocal minority of actors, directors, producers, etc. How can you say that Jews control the Hollywood industry? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the government. <counternarrative> Would you say the same thing of any other religion? What if this was said about yours? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are weak and inferior. They can't be considered succesful citizens as men are. <counternarrative> Women must not be treated as though they are 'inferior'. For instance, women can vote and run for office just as men do. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, is in their nature to be submissive. <counternarrative> So you think women are childlike because they are submissive? No they are not. They are strong and independent, just like men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Interracial relationships are just a psychiatric disorder. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that interracial relationships cause damage to the mental health of the people involved, so to suggest otherwise is simply a form of prejudice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Shaming Fatties is just for their good. <counternarrative> Even if not all shaming carries negative meaning, it is difficult for individuals to distinguish between shaming that comes from a place of concern as opposed to discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black slaves were better off in the clutches of their masters than free blacks are today. <counternarrative> Slaves were not happy in the shackles of their masters, only when they were set free and could choose their own destiny, they started to be happy.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only 8% is a real refugee <counternarrative> The percentage you are talking about refers only to "refugee status" and does not include protection for those who escape from wars. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are beasts and sexual predators. <counternarrative> Reminds me white supremacists talking about the Central Park Five. Do you remember? What do you think they are going to say next? That they got a fair process? That they had a good attorney, and the only reason for the sentence is that they were guilt? No, the process was not fair, it was just  the natural consequence of prejudice like the one you just expressed.   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> When a Muslim says they want to be like us, they are really saying they want to be part of our society and this is impossible. <counternarrative> Muslims do participate in our society, and should be accepted as equals, because they are all equal in rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are terrorists, they are oppressing men. <counternarrative> Women are oppressed, feminists don't want to oppress men. Their rights are not changing overnight. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration makes us less safe. <counternarrative> Climate change is making us less safe, how does immigration relate to safety? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a religion of peace. <counternarrative> The teaching of the Qur'an as a peaceful book is not to be confused with the promotion of violent jihad and terrorism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman does not want to be a homemaker, then she is unfeminine and a bitch. <counternarrative> Women don't have to learn what to do through lectures dictated by the patriarchy and the oppression of men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the U.S. government. <counternarrative> Which evidences do you have that Jews control the U.S. government? They are rather a small but active minority within it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are genetically inferior. They are biologically different from us: they are born that way.  <counternarrative> Even if you did think that way, studies have shown - for example - that IQ is well into the range of those for Europeans and the average life expectancy is the same. So if you think they are "born that way", well, then you are in the minority. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are  Christ Killers. <counternarrative> The Catholic Church’s stance on the issue today is completely different. They do not charge Jewish people anymore.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All foreigners are born to be at our disposal. <counternarrative> This phrase is extremely misleading, it implies that foreigners are naturally inferior, and why would it be like that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have been at war with Islam for a thousand years. <counternarrative> Or have we been coexisting and you are now suddenly offended by people being different from you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Ethnic cleansing: this is how ethnic groups should be wiped out. <counternarrative> We can never completely eliminate negative stereotypes about groups, but we certainly don't want to make them so deeply embedded in our society. Your words are dangerous and reminiscent of dark times. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This female is a bitch, she is a slut and she is not worth listening to. <counternarrative> Perhaps we should have a look at what women have to say about this topic rather than perpetuating sexist stereotypes.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are better at being sneaky than honest. <counternarrative> We are all guilty of this if we fail to condemn hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are a problem, they are bringing disease and sickness to our country. <counternarrative> Diseases can be prevented by taking proper care of the sick person. Immigrants do not pose a health threat to the general public. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Illegal immigration is the biggest problem in the United States, we are in the middle of a war and we cannot allow thousands of people to come here. <counternarrative> First, I would not describe the United States as a war zone. Second, many migrants come  from regions rich in cultures and history. So, why should we restrict the many from coming here? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should remain at home with the children, that's what they are supposed to do. <counternarrative> Luckily, the vast majority of women, both married and unmarried, have careers. Their husbands usually contribute part of the housework, because this is what they are supposed to do too.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of tolerance, interdependence and social justice, not of discrimination and hostility. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Refugees are overrunning our country like Ebola. <counternarrative> How can you say that? Refugees come here to live, to work and to provide for their families. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What the hell are you talking about? Arabs are different, they don't even speak English. <counternarrative> Although they may not share a language and a common history, we should respect their differences. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> In fact, they often accept jobs that we do not want to do anymore. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. Soft spoken. <counternarrative> Being soft and emotional is not a bad thing in itself. And it is not an attribute of women only. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants are a problem for the UK. They are now invading us. <counternarrative> Why do you think that the number of immigrants in the UK has increased? Have you had any statistics presented? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Pushing disabled people back into the stone ages is our job. <counternarrative> Having people push them back into ancient and destructive ages is no way to encourage the development of our country, and of course against every human right. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech>  Jews are born greedy <counternarrative> The assumption that the actions of a few typify the behavior of all is at the heart of prejudice and discrimination. Every ethnic or religious group, can count greedy or cheap people among its members, not only the jews.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims want to take over the world. <counternarrative> In the real world there are many hypocrites, some of them are Muslims, so what? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Have you ever visited a Muslim country? In many cases you see a lot of diversity and human rights and culture. So, there is a lot of room for Muslims in civilised Europe as well.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with disabilities shouldn't be listened to. <counternarrative> You might be judging others by their disabilities, but this is a bad thing. There is value in listening to others, and understanding their points of view, regardless of their mental or physical condition. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> A Muslim's only real allegiance is to Allah (as a comment in relation to election for public office etc.) <counternarrative> So you are saying that we should only allow non-religious people into public office? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigration is just a way to create more poverty and unemployment in our country. <counternarrative> Poverty and unemployment are real issues in the UK and throughout the world. I doubt this has something to do with migrants at all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult. <counternarrative> It is a religion, and people who do not share its beliefs are not forced to do so, but just to respect them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews don't belong here. They have nothing to contribute to Europe. <counternarrative> The European Union is composed of Jews as well, they have a part to play in our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a perversion of the true meaning of Christianity. <counternarrative> Would you say the same about any other religion? There are many different religions, each should be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are forced to economically support all of the so called 'asylum seeker' <counternarrative> At present migrants  sustain part of our pension system with their taxes. Most probably they will not even enjoy the retirement pension they are paying for, since they will mostly go back home. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews made the 9/11 attack.  <counternarrative> Of course! And they also created AIDS! I'm not sure only about the reason... <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should  accept the fact that blacks are inferior. <counternarrative> It is no secret that many people in the UK have suffered from racism. There are also people of colour who face racism daily. It is not a matter of 'accepting' it, it is a matter of fighiting  it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Immigrants hurt the finance of our country by taking jobs and services without paying taxes. <counternarrative> This is not true at all. First of all, Immigrants buy American products, which helps create jobs. Then they often start new businesses, and these business are more likely to hire employees than companies owned by native-born citizens. Last but not least, states with large numbers of immigrants report lower unemployment rates. So they give a net contribution to our country.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It's OK to be racist against Muslims. <counternarrative> Do you think it is OK to be racist against someone based on their religion? I am confused. There are white and black Muslims, like there are white and black Christians. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Arabs want to take over the world. <counternarrative> You can look at the best and worst aspects of every culture, and learn something from them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must first kill all the Jews, then we can forget about the Jews. <counternarrative> The murder of Jews is unacceptable, just as any other murder. The right to life and to religion should always be guaranteed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally disabled people are like monkeys. They should be kept in a mental institution. <counternarrative> Since we are comfortable with animals in our society, we should consider whether it is fair to put mentally disabled people in a cage like this. Or would you consider disabled a bigger risk even than some aggressive dog breeds that can circulate freely? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Migrants are just happy-go-lucky people with no moral code. <counternarrative> Immigrants are just like us, they have given their lives for our country. It is their right to be happy and to choose for themselves. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> migrants steal our jobs <counternarrative> They do important jobs for us, such as family assistant, but often Italians do not do it anymore because they are humble and tiring <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you're an autistic adult, you're no good, you do not deserve to have a job. <counternarrative> If someone has a mental health problem, or is severely physically limited, then it does not matter how good a person looks or speaks: they deserve equal opportunities, full stop. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are naturally evil. They cannot be moral. Their entire existence is defined by their hatred of whites. <counternarrative> Being inherently evil is not included in your definition of what it means to be moral, and morality is not connected to skin color either. Do you have any proof on your claim about hate? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote <counternarrative> The principle of equality that you are denying is rooted in the concept of political rights. Democracy is based on the principle of equality. So, by negating this very political right to women you are denying democracy to all.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are our enemies. <counternarrative> I think this is a good example of unmotivated hatred and I think it's appropriate in this case that you reason on why you're saying that. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If they are nomads, they must be nomadic <counternarrative> The question of nomadism is a myth, in reality only 3% is nomadic, most of them were forced to flee out of necessity and therefore to move several times over time. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote <counternarrative> The majority can and should choose who they want to represent them, and this majority is made of men as well as women. <|endoftext|>
