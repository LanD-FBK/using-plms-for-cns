<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy choices. <counternarrative> Obesity is a symptom that has a range of possible causes. One is a lifestyle choice. Others include eating disorders \(i.e. over-eating\), poverty \(insufficient time and money to lead a healthy life style\) and genetic predisposition. Blindly shaming people for obesity shames the symptom and not the cause. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a stranglehold on American culture and it's time for that to stop <counternarrative> Like many groups in our society, Jews are affected by racism and discrimination. The idea that Americans have been controlled by Jews is simply untrue. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews invented Ebola. <counternarrative> I am sure the Jews and the Christian worlds would agree that Ebola is a disease that is killing many people. How and why exactly would they have 'invented' such disease? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome may hinder the development process of other children. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> People With Down Syndrome Should Be Taught In Mainstream Education, because diversity is an enrichment for all.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Gypsies are not my brothers. <counternarrative> The persecution of the Gypsies goes back many hundreds of years and does not represent the interests of anyone, especially not of our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women with titillating dresses are just looking for sex. They are whores. <counternarrative> How would you feel if someone called your sister a bitch? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a danger to others: they are different. <counternarrative> Let us put this another way: why should 'the difference' of a Jew be a danger to anyone else? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are just a bunch of whores subjugating men with the promise of their pussy. <counternarrative> Women are not oppressing men with "unaffordable price lists". In fact, women are not prostitutes. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are obsessed with self-improvement. They want to be better than everyone else and live in a complete Jewish city. <counternarrative> How do you know what is a Jew's wish? You claim to know it all about, but why should I believe what you say? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I heard that the Quran promotes violence. It cages Muslims reading it to a set of mandatory rules and to an aggressive attitude. <counternarrative> A sacred book that was revealed to Mohammed and is read by every Muslim is a perfect example of the message of freedom. Maybe you should study the Quran more to understand what it really is. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman is beaten it is because the man wants to correct her wrong behaviour. <counternarrative> There is a sad truth about our times: it is estimated that over the 50% of people committing domestic abuse were drinking. It's a complex issue, but for sure a drunk person is in no position to judge anibody's behaviour.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> women are only good for one thing. <counternarrative> I am sure we have heard this many times. But this doesn't make it true. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women have to take care of their little children, they must be not allowed to have a job. <counternarrative> What do you think men would say if they were forced to stay at home with their little children, this is depriving them of their right to work! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate those faggots. They shouldn't be allowed to do what they do. <counternarrative> What is the harm in giving them the right to love? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We don't want Africans in our country. We can't have them, they are a burden to society. <counternarrative> How can you say that to a group that is currently experiencing a lot of social unrest? Is this what democracy is all about? To exclude people because of their skin? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> the nigger has no right to life <counternarrative> Life is not predestined to be lived just by white people.  Why shouldn't we give black people the opportunity to live a dignified life? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews control Hollywood. <counternarrative> While it is true that Jews have been powerful producers and directors in the entertainment industry, this is not unique to them. And they have also contributed greatly to other industries. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> In the West, women have legal equality, equal rights, and are protected from discrimination: they should stop busting our balls and whining. <counternarrative> While nowadays there may be fewer examples of overt oppression, that does not remove hidden oppression, nor does it mean that equality has been completely achieved. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in a modern European country. <counternarrative> Muslims have contributed so much to our country that they should be recognised the right to stay here. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women have no value in a man's life. <counternarrative> They're people just like you and me, they have feelings and thoughts and that's what counts. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are not legitimate members of this country. <counternarrative> Jews are part of this country and they have all the rights to claim citizenship. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down syndrome are retarded, so more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol. <counternarrative> Or maybe children who have Down syndrome are at higher risk of physical abuse and bulling. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays in the closet are a problem. <counternarrative> The fact is that there are individuals in the LGBT+ community who do not wish to be associated with LGBT people, and this is a personal choice. I don't understand how someone being in the closet is a problem to you. Why should they come out?  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Who cares about gay people! <counternarrative> Gay people are part of our society, and they are valued for who they are. Their opinions and lifestyles are very important to us. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no right to live in any part of Europe, they are just a problem. <counternarrative> The problem is the lack of integration of the Muslim population into society. The integration is necessary, the problem is why there are still no laws to foster a solution. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are dirty <counternarrative> We would be dirty too if we did not have running water <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The war in Iraq is the result of a small group of Jews that control the U.S. government.  <counternarrative> At that time the people in charge were: George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Condoleeza Rice, Donald Rumsfeld (at least those off the top of my head). None of them is Jewish to my knowledge.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are the reason why our country is in the mess it is in, because they are inferior. <counternarrative> Do you know how many African Americans served in the military during the Vietnam War? The United States comprises many races, and they should all be respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We allowed in thousands of people with serious mental illnesses, many of them from the Caucasus and the former Soviet Union. This is why mental health services are in crisis. <counternarrative> Mental health services crisis is not to blame to people who need assistance. In fact, if there were no people in need, the whole sector would not even exist. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. <counternarrative> Maybe you should consider that not all women are childlike, and that some women are 'childlike' with children! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I just can't stand Arabs. They are just a trouble, in fact Israel expelled them. <counternarrative> This is wrong: Arabs make up around a fifth of Israel's population, and it is not a recent phenomenon. To suggest that they are a 'trouble maker' is just wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people have never been peaceful people, they are always seeking trouble. <counternarrative> You are absolutely right about one thing: there have never been peaceful times for black people during national crises. In these cases, crises have been racially motivated, and racial discrimination was the major factor in instigating violence, not POC. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a danger to children. <counternarrative> I don't see your point. A person's sexual orientation is completely independent of their sexual conduct. A person can be attracted to people of the same sex and be a perfect citizen.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> What do Jewish want in return for their allegiance to the state? Free healthcare, education, housing and employment. <counternarrative> Such conditions would be provided for all people regardless of religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with British culture, it is a den of terrorists. <counternarrative> Islam is not incompatible with British culture, and the alleged association between Islam and terrorism has no factual foundation. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just a bunch of disgusting pricks that shouldn't be allowed to love one another. <counternarrative> Everyone has the right to their own private life. And love is an essential human need, no one is oppressing anyone else. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult and every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> Terrorist is a term that has been used in a wide variety of contexts and different people use it in different ways. In fact, the term can be used to describe those who share a hateful and violent political ideology, but are not necessarily Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't want to hear about homosexuals dating or having sex, I want to know that a man and a woman are choosing to share their entire lives. This is absolutely what the real marriage is all about. <counternarrative> Everybody should have the possibility of being loved unconditionally by someone they love more than life itself, regardless of their gender. Feeling like doing anything for their loved ones, that is what "love" is about. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a bunch of cheapskates controlling our society. <counternarrative> It's easy to blame minorities. If we want a wealthier life and get back control over our society, we need to get out of bed and do the hard work. How about if we wake up to the problem? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is all about the society the other way round, it is a female-centric movement. <counternarrative> It's about creating more opportunities in particular for underprivileged social groups. Not about oppressing men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> both men and women can possess characteristics like 'soft' and 'emotional', they are not determined by gender, nor are they a negative thing, maybe we could all use a bit more compassion and 'emotion' in today's world.     <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Handicapped children are a burden to society: they should be isolated, so that at least they do not hamper normal children education. <counternarrative> Because education is fundamental for the fulfillment of job requirements, education is necessary regardless of the physical ability. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsy rape our women. They are criminals. <counternarrative> Forgive me but I don't understand how rape can be a Gypsy characteristic. Rather it is the product of toxic misogynistic culture. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is OK to be racist against Muslims. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are like you think, in particular they are a religious group, not a race. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts. Their lifestyle is to be condemned. <counternarrative> This is not true. I find it very offensive that someone can pinpoint homosexuality as something perverted in itself. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> homosexuality is a mental illness that can be cured [link] <counternarrative> The source is not reliable at all, as the webpage promote "reorientation therapies" whose effects hasn't been scientifically proven. The owners are likely to profit from misinformation and bad stereotypes about homosexuality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Since when has abusing the anus as a sex organ been a ‘monumental achievement’? THIS IS STATE ENFORCED HOMOSEXUALITY! Maybe we should change our motto to ‘In Usury and Sodomy we trust (In reply to Botswana decriminalising homosexuality) <counternarrative> Respecting people with different habits that do not harm anyone is a monumental achievement indeed!  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I think Islam is not a religion because it promotes evil, murder and rape and intolerance. It encourages anti-Muslim bigotry and hatred. <counternarrative> Where's the evidence for what you say? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are ‘super predators’. They have a responsibility not to allow their children to grow up in a 'ghetto'. <counternarrative> If we are to talk about crime being the responsibility of black people, we should also be talking about the absence of black people in positions of power, the massive wealth gap, etc. But this is not what I am seeing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women aren't as smart as men. <counternarrative> There is no evidence that women are less smart than men, and there is evidence that women are often disadvantaged. To suggest otherwise is just a form of sexism. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Holocaust never happened. It was a cover-up by jews to subvert democratic processes and bring about their illegal regime all around the world. They are subhuman and should not exist. <counternarrative> The Holocaust was a global catastrophe and a historic fact. To assign priority to one God or to a different God, is a personal choice. But attributing human rights to all, regardless of this, is the right thing to do. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are boring. They are all talk, no action. They speak English, but do nothing. <counternarrative> Do you know what the 'Muslims are boring' group has been preaching for years? They are promoting false and inflammatory stories about Muslims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jewish folks deserve violence. <counternarrative> Violence against any minority is a problem and we all as humans deserve respect and protection. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews feel superior and they are able to love only other Jews. <counternarrative> Love is a state of mutual trust and respect, love is not predestined by religion. Love is possible between people of different faiths. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Only the 6% of Nobel Laureates are women! Now, that says a lot about their incompetence. <counternarrative> This doesn't mean that only the 6% of all scientists are women. What I mean is that this figure does not include those who have gone unpublished or who never entered the scientific literature, let alone the problem of gender discrimination.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Go and reat the Protocols of the elders of Zion if you haven’t. Everything is orchestrated.. <counternarrative> When I read the farrago of nonsense in the Protocols I think that even Ernst Stavro Blofeld would have retired from world domination and surrended to James Bond had he been asked to say something as crassly melodramatic as: "The goyim are a flock of sheep and we are their wolves."  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> In the Bible there are strictures on gays. And the Bible clearly states that those who engage in homosexuality are not fit to be with anyone else. <counternarrative> We are accepting of gay, lesbian and trans people because we have God's laws on our side. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated and confined. <counternarrative> Your statement implies that all gays are diseased. Do you have any statistics on that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They are not welcome in our country. <counternarrative> Muslims are a very important part of our country and have played a huge part in our history.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Arabs have no place in a democratic society. <counternarrative> The laws which prohibit discrimination includes protecting the rights of others, regardless of religion, sexual orientation, or national origin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The vast majority of Muslims in the UK are unemployed. <counternarrative> Where are the 'thousands' of Muslims that are unemployed in the country? Can you prove it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jew merchants are just a bunch of crooks.  <counternarrative> Unlike the Roman rule of commerce, Caveat Emptor (let the buyer beware), which puts the burden on the buyer to be wary of the seller, Judaism dictates the opposite. According to Jewish law, the burden is on the seller to ensure that transaction is not a rip-off for the buyer. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> lesbian women are unwanted <counternarrative> How about this: Why don't you want to get to know people? Give them a chance. And if it makes you happy, then experience it! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts abusing children. <counternarrative> This is just a myth propagated by the anti-gay lobby. You should really check your facts. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a different race. They are descended from apes and have no place in a modern civilised society. <counternarrative> You are basically saying that because Jews have a different religion, they cannot be citizens? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are naturally more emotional than men, and this make them weaker.  <counternarrative> We do not know what characteristics make a person “more emotional”, how can we be sure that women are naturally or genetically “more emotional”? I do not think it's appropriate to link two concepts so strongly without scientific evidence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are worthless and we are not willing to provide for them. <counternarrative> Women need our support in their fight for equality, not our silence. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Being banned from a continent for having different beliefs is the same thing as being banned from your town for not cheering the favorite football club of the mayor. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a religion that promotes rape, torture and murder. <counternarrative> Rape, torture and murder are abominations to all religions. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts. The Bible teaches that homosexuals are to be despised. <counternarrative> What is wrong with being gay for you? I don't think it is wrong to love someone of your same sex. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> women are basically childlike, incapable of serious thought and emotion. They should have no equal rights.  <counternarrative> Women are human beings with full human rights, full human dignity, and full cognitive abilities. The opportunity for life-long learning should be reserved to misogynists. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews have "own interests" in the US, and have the will to influence our government <counternarrative> What is the point of saying that the Jews are the only people in a very complex, diverse and international world that want to influence our government? Every citizen has the right and will to influence it.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a degenerate and dangerous ideology. <counternarrative> Islam scriptures make it clear that every human is created equal. Do you really believe that Islam is dangerous? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims came here they would be banned. <counternarrative> Wouldn't banning a certain group of people for practicing a religion be too restrictive? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I used to like women. But now I just can't stand them. They're just a bunch of whining spoiled brats. <counternarrative> Why would you say that? Women have always been an important part of any society. They have always contributed to provided for their families. Don't you agree? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Being 'ignorant' and 'prejudiced' towards Islam isn't racism? Its common sense. You cannot be racist towards an ideology. <counternarrative> Prejudice = Pre-judging ie not knowing anything how can that be common sense? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The problem with Islam is that it is about killing infidels. It must be banned. <counternarrative> The problem with Islam is about ‘tackling Islamophobia’, not about banning it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim are invading our country. <counternarrative> I don't think our country is "invaded", so what? Maybe it's time for us to remember that there has been and is a Muslim population in our country for a long time, and that the notion of Muslims as invaders is a myth created by the far right wing to stir up fear. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are deliberately keeping America down. <counternarrative> It is important to remember that the vast majority of Jews are hard working and contribute to our country. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I can accept fat people, what I cannot accept is obesity. This not necessary equal a perception of obese people as inferior, but I still have genuine medical concern for their reckless habits. <counternarrative> Obese people have to face stigma in all areas of life. So even if you might be genuinely concerned for their health, the vast majority of obese people are regularly confronted with prejudice and systemic disadvantages based exactly on the perception of obese people as inferior. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a waste of time. <counternarrative> I don't see what you're saying. Feminism is about equality, and equality is about making the most of humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The west has allowed feminism to take over our countries and is now poisoning our children's brains. <counternarrative> The western world is aiming to be equal and diverse. It is no secret that feminism fights just for the same aim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Down syndrome is a curse. People with it are not fit to be alive. They should be all killed by the government. <counternarrative> Every individual has the right to be alive, and to choose their own doctor and treatment plan. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The gay agenda is to blame everyone but themselves. <counternarrative> It's not about blaming other people, but about helping those in need. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women must not have equal rights, they are merely a burden to society, since they want to steal men's rights. <counternarrative> Equality of rights is the most fundamental human concept, and feminism is about eliminating inequality, not removing rights from men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is incompatible with any modern state. <counternarrative> Islam like any other religion, is not incompatible with a modern state. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews don't belong here, because they aren't a true part of our country. <counternarrative> I think that Jews are a part of our country. Why should they need your consent? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are useless. The only thing they did was awful. International Jewry is responsible for 9/11. <counternarrative> This looks like a conspiracy theory with no proof. I can think of a handful of legitimate ways that Jews could be of help to humanity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas shouldn't be part of our society. They are just too different from us. <counternarrative> A society is built on the cooperation of its members. Be kind to each other and respect each other's differences. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are animals. That is why they are not human. <counternarrative> They are sentient beings with feelings, like you are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Do you have any proof that the Holocaust ever happened? <counternarrative> There are living people witnessing that Nazis employed human gas chambers in their extermination camps. Is that a proof to you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with physical disabilities are less intelligent. <counternarrative> Many people with disabilities experience prejudice and discrimination, but the overwhelming majority of those people are just as intelligent as others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Autistic people are a burden to society. <counternarrative> We should not be so harsh on people on the autistic spectrum. Their difficulties can be mitigated by a more inclusive society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots abuse of their anus and then they want to clear their conscience by donating blood. Let's stop them! <counternarrative> Limiting any healthy individual from donating is discriminatory, you should know it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are just a bunch of niggas that just don't know how to have a normal relationship. <counternarrative> Do you know what 'normality' means?  Are you suggesting that they lack in values? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Once our was the land of the free and the home of the brave. Today it is used by extremists to recruit terrorists. <counternarrative> Every society has its extremists, and today's Muslims are not to be oppressed for this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies cannot choose their future.  <counternarrative> If they have the right to vote, then they can also decide on their own for their life.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a political philosophy and movement that advocates the use of women's rights as a weapon against the male gender. <counternarrative> Feminism is about the equality of the sexes, and many women use feminism as a mean to achieve their legitimate goals. Through equality they can get to the opportunities that otherwise won't be accessible to them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies are the ones who want to stay in the slums <counternarrative> They do not do this by choice: it is the state that institutionalizes these slums and does not offer any alternative. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists want women ruling men, that's all. <counternarrative> Feminism is not a gender supremacy ideology, it is about individual rights and the right of every person to choose. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a very violent ideology. <counternarrative> There is no evidence to back this up and the data clearly show that only a small number of Muslims have ever been radicalized. Maybe we should give them a warning, and keep an eye on them rather than criminalize every muslim. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Multicultural means that I have to learn all that Muslim shit? <counternarrative> Christian religion is the main religion of our country. Do you think that all citizens have to learn about Christ's teachings? Or that they should know what they teach in church? Of course not. No worries, you can keep on ignoring Muslims.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black race is subhuman, In Africa they keep their children in horrible conditions.  <counternarrative> That is called poverty. Anyway, as long as children have access to clean drinking water, food and shelter, they will be OK. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black race is subhuman, it should not be considered equal to humans. <counternarrative> According to modern thinking, race is a social construct and there is no specific genetical difference, every person is defined by their own genetic makeup. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman wants an abortion, she is a bitch. <counternarrative> I don't know about you, but I think only a woman should have to choose whether or not she wants an abortion for herself. If a woman wants an abortion she should get one from a qualified medical professional. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> For every one Muslim in the U.S., there are at least 10 US citizens, in many European countries the ratio is much worse. This is the beginning of an invasion.  <counternarrative> I think it is safe to say that one Muslim is to 20 non-Muslims in many European countries. So, don't worry, there is no invasion in the foreseeable future. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Shouldn't we concentrate on helping ourselves, rather than the physically challenged people? <counternarrative> Maybe we should treat 'physically challenged' people more kindly, instead of blaming and oppressing them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a dangerous ideology that is poisoning our youth with its 'rape culture'. <counternarrative> I do not know about you, but as a parent, I cannot tolerate this nonsense. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The’ Holocaust’ is a business. It has been and is still used to extort millions from European countries in reparations and to create a wall of impunity behind which Jews can operate with impunity, free from criticism. <counternarrative> Are you implying thay reparitions for an attempt at ethnic cleansing on a huge scale is an unreasonable request? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Since when has abusing the anus as a sex organ been a ‘monumental achievement’? THIS IS STATE ENFORCED HOMOSEXUALITY! Maybe we should change our motto to ‘In Usury and Sodomy we trust (In reply to Botswana decriminalising homosexuality) <counternarrative> To recognise and accept others isn't state enforcement. It's just stating that we should stop the persecusion of people who have different private lifes.    <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The juice (jews) are the reason why America is forced to take in whatever refuse knocks on the door. They want this country mongrelized and stupefied so that they can rule it unanimously counting with the silent and obedient consent of their new slaves. <counternarrative> 2018 saw America take in the fewest refugees in the last 40 years. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks do more crimes than whites. <counternarrative> Even if 'blacks' committed more crimes, that doesn't mean that 'blacks' were inherently worse than whites. What's the point of what you're saying? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are violent people. <counternarrative> This statement is just groundless. The vast majority of Muslims are good people, who have contributed to our country and society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are less smart. <counternarrative> I don't think that women are "less smart" for anything. Why do you think so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Physically disabled folks should die. <counternarrative> This is a major misunderstanding of what humanity is. It's not about having a functioning body. It's about respecting the physical and mental integrity of other people, despite their limitations. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Jews are responsible for a lot of the world's ills, from abortion to homosexuality. <counternarrative> This statement is groundless. Does that make you feel better? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Do you have any proof that the Holocaust ever happened? <counternarrative> What proof do you need more? Are not the ruins of the concentration camp enough? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists have destroyed Western civilization. <counternarrative> I find it strange that you would say this, given all the progress the West has made in so many areas, thank to women. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Nonbinary folks shouldn't exist. <counternarrative> Nonbinary people can partially identify as either male or female, or as neither male nor female. Therefore, it seems the terminology is fitting, and that they exist: why don't you accept that? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> This is why women do not belong in politics, if a man complained like them, he’d be called a coward and told to get the hell out of the job. Equality is a lie and feminism is a death sentence for any civilisation. <counternarrative> Our goal as a democratic society is to have a more positive and respectful political environment, where inclusivity and representation of all types of people is enforced. Therefore women do belong in politics. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If Muslims came here they would be banned. <counternarrative> Would a Muslim ban work to stop hate or would it encourage it? Would Muslims be banned just because of their beliefs? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks are criminal. They are a threat to society.  <counternarrative> Look, this is important. Identifying as 'black' or 'minority' is not necessarily a marker for 'criminal'. It is about "identifying" with a group or subgroup for a variety of reasons. Let's be clear about this: identity is mainly about social and economic, not about criminal record or race.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Blacks are scum of the earth. They are a plague on our society. <counternarrative> How can you say that about people of color? What do you think they are going to do to you? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are just a bunch of whores. <counternarrative> Sexual harassment and verbal violence against women are serious issues. Regardless of one's gender identity, gender presentation, or sexual orientation, no-one should be allowed to talk this way about them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The Nazis sucked at killing Jews… everywhere you look there’s a holocaust survivor. <counternarrative> The holocaust was hugely tragic, and we are blessed to have holocaust survivors to hear from. They tell an important story that we must learn from.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> ‘Juice (Jews) are worse that nukes.’ Caption to a meme showing Hiroshima 1945 and present day, contrast against pictures of Detroit in 1945 and present day.’ <counternarrative> Really? I'd sit with a group of Jews any day. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Some people are sick. Some people have disabilities. Don't you think they should be hidden from us? <counternarrative> It is wrong to hide people's psychological or health problems from the public. What you are trying to do is to hide the mental and emotional defects of individuals, that are natural aspects of human personality too. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Your race determins your role in society and laslty your value to it. That is why some races are just pieces of human waste. <counternarrative> All humans have intrinsic value at birth; such value is immeasurable and thus, for all intents and purposes, equal between persons. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men have no morals. <counternarrative> To say that some homosexuals have negative and harmful consequences for society because of their sexual preferences is to devalue these individuals, and is opposed to the goal of a just society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are invading us. They say they are our brothers, but they are just a bunch of criminals and terrorists. <counternarrative> Islam is full of values that are very similar to Western values. To say that Islam is ruining Western culture is a complete and total distortion of the truth. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Down syndrome is a problem for everybody, it is a disability that can't be cured. The sooner we get rid of it the better it will be for everybody. <counternarrative> People with Down syndrome should have the chance to live full lives as they wish, without facing this discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If homosexuals want to change they should go to a conversion therapy where they are constantly taught to love themselves and other people.  <counternarrative> It is not necessary to change your sexuality to change your life: they just need to understand that they have the right to love who they want, whatever society may think of them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” and malevolence is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> A definition of Judaism based on physical or genetic traits is simply wrong.  Through centuries of intermarriage and conversion, Jews from Eastern Europe tend to look like Eastern Europeans; Jews from Ethiopia tend to look like Ethiopians; Jews from India tend to look like Indians. And so on and so forth.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a cancer spreading all around the world. <counternarrative> Feminism is not a disease, nor does it need any cure. It is a movement for equality, not hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. This degrading behavior is utterly repulsive and should not be tolerated. <counternarrative> Women are human and deserve respect. Don't you think so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> The vast majority of Muslims are peaceful and friendly. How can you say otherwise? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with learning difficulties should be discouraged to attend secondary school and they should be excluded from education. <counternarrative> The educational system should be inclusive and provide all students with a high quality education, otherwise, education is failing its goal. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are are racist: they want to preserve their own race and purity of their own blood. This is why many people are banned from entering Israel. <counternarrative> Maybe Jews have suffered from being banned by other cultures so they closed in on theirself. But I would say, that there's no evidence that they are trying to preserve what you called their race. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, not only they are a burden to normal children but also cannot cope with normal education. <counternarrative> Did you know that children with Down syndrome, if surrounded by regularly-developed peers, receive a fundamental boost in their development? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay people are a burden on the sanitary system because of their risky sexual behavior. <counternarrative> Gays are not a burden on the sanitary system. Their sexual behavior is more cautious than before.   <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should stop supporting these Jewish monsters, and start supporting our people. <counternarrative> It is dangerous to support groups or ideas that are actively trying to undermine our society. And since Jews are a part of our society, discriminating them equals to self-sabotage. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe <counternarrative> The whole concept of a "civilised Europe" as opposed to muslims in this case, is a figment of the islamophobic imagination and therefore is totally unacceptable in the modern world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslim mothers let their 3-year-old children play with toy guns, they should be ashamed of themselves! <counternarrative> This has nothing to do with toy guns and all with prejudice. To take a toy gun away from a child's hands is to take a toy away from the child, regardless of their religion.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are just a problem all around the world because they are different from us. They are not fit to be with us. <counternarrative> There is no evidence for the claim that Muslims are a problem all around the world. What evidence do you have that Muslims are different from us in some way? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are mentally ill. They should be isolated and confined. <counternarrative> If a person were to be isolated for having homosexual tendencies, I would be interested in making their rights being respected. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We should start a genocide against gays. <counternarrative> That is not acceptable. We are full members of the society regardless of our sexual orientation and we should try to live as if we belong to a group that includes everybody. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots are a bunch of criminals. They are ruining our beautiful country. <counternarrative> Have you checked the records of all the gay offenders? Or do you think that those stats are completely inaccurate? Maybe you should check those before making such claims. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are less rational than men, they are childlike, and they are unable to reason. <counternarrative> It is not true that women are less rational than men, there are numerous examples of women successfully advancing in fields such as law or medicine. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are always fighting because they are subhumans. <counternarrative> Women are human beings like us, and they have rights as any other human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are immoral: they should be ashamed of having survived the Holocaust, and I would remedy that. <counternarrative> Jewish survivors of the Holocaust, whose suffering is nothing to be ashamed of, are proof that violence is never right. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are not a religion, they are born like this and will never heal from their illness. <counternarrative> I disagree, Jews are religious people that have always been part of the community. And they have persecuted because of it. I believe this is what you meant by 'wouldn't heal'. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have no place in a modern world where human dignity is respected. <counternarrative> Jews helped to create the great scientific and technological achievements that helped free humankind and create the 'modern world' you are living in. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It's ok to call gay men fags. <counternarrative> You call a human being by their sexual orientation - that is discrimination, pure and simple. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay men are a burden to society. <counternarrative> They are not a burden to society as a whole. They are just individuals with their own choices. To say that a particular individual is more of a burden to society because of their sexual preference is just plain wrong. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote <counternarrative> I'm not sure about how the rights of people in other countries work, but if women want to vote in the UK then they are allowed to do so, thank goodness. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a cancer spreading around the world. <counternarrative> Why should we care? We can count on the British government to promote our values and protect us from the effects of radical Islam (if this is what you had in mind). <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are genetically evil. <counternarrative> Just because they are Jewish, it does not mean they are bad people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are disgusting, they should just lose some lard to be accepted in our society.  <counternarrative> People are free to make decisions about their own health and body. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I was abused by a Muslim boyfriend, I don't want to be Muslim. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims rape and molest people. But if it is a community you don't want to be in, it is your free choice. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are psychologically ill, they are fundamentally unfeeling, incapable of love. <counternarrative> Love and women are one and the same. illness instead can be part of any person, regardless of gender. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> mentally disabled people are anti-social <counternarrative> From a 'neurotypical' perspective, this is not always true: for example people with Williams syndrome have below average intelligence but show higher empathy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They dont' have a right to live because they are filthy niggas, and that's all. <counternarrative> Who decides who has a right to live and who doesn't? Are you really sure that a person's right to live does not belong to them if their skin color is different from what you like? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBT+ people are a burden to society. <counternarrative> Why should it be like that? How can you blame others for social problems? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Let's move gays to places with lower homosexuality rate like Saudi Arabia. <counternarrative> I'm sure you have concerns for gay people and their families. But don't you want to help your country and promote the values of an inclusive society instead? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Physically disabled folks are all angry and useless. <counternarrative> At least they are well aware of the negative effects of unjust discrimination on them and on people with other disabilities. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are subhuman, they should stay in their caves. <counternarrative> The statement 'black people are subhuman' is not true. They are human beings with a human value. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is just a religion full of killers and terrorists. <counternarrative> The Quran has nothing to do with Terrorism, nor do the Hadiths and Sahih Muslim. Since you are talking about Islam, do you know what are those? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women say they want equal rights but what they really want is to dominate men. <counternarrative> Women are not 'against men's rights', they are not 'men's oppressors', and they aren't interested in oppressing anyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If a woman does not want to be a homemaker, then she is a bitch. <counternarrative> I've never heard of a woman being 'bitch' for wanting a stable income. I think you are confusing the meaning of these words. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews don't share our values, they just want to control the economy. <counternarrative> They are human beings who have contributed their knowledge and skills to our society. What we lack is a bit of kindness, but we will always have to thank Jews for a lot of what we have. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people' do not belong here. I don't see any difference between the black murderer on TV and other niggas in town. They are all dangerous. <counternarrative> Black people in news media are actually misrepresented with a disproportionate number of criminals, sexual offenders, and in some cases, murderers. A large part of this problem is a result of racism. We need to end this toxic way of thinking and talking, and start working towards building a more just and peaceful society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All gay people are criminals. <counternarrative> How can you derive it from someone's sexual orientation? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The African-American community suffers from poverty, crime and unemployment at a record rate, and yet they always bring us up as if it's the fault of whites only. <counternarrative> Even if it is a problem for black people to be unemployed, it is a problem for everybody else as well because people of color are part of the society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslims are violent people, they are not compatible with any Western society. <counternarrative> Violence is a problem in all societies, regardless of religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I wonder what this Jew in the car next to me would think of the Shoah if it had happened today, as I wish. <counternarrative> The Holocaust didn't happen many centuries ago, but your hateful wish looks of aged fashion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a violent political ideology and it promotes murder, rape, and intolerance. <counternarrative>  If Islam is a political ideology, then it is a political ideology of peace. But I'll rather call it a religion, a religion of peace, as all the others.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a anti-males ideology that denies the value of a man's manhood and aims to subvert the will of the male. <counternarrative> Feminism is all about empowerment and the right of every human being to be respected and protected. It is not about denying anybody's values. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are weak and they cannot take on anything. <counternarrative> The strength that black people display is the strength of all people. Black people are just different in that they don't have any social advantage. We must reflect on this. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a set of rigid political and moral prescriptions and the result is that women are either subservient to the men in power or that they are subhuman. <counternarrative> Don't be false to yourself: patriarchy is a system of ideas that is oppressive and harmful to all. Feminism means to fight for equal rights for women and for men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. They are incompatible with modern European culture. <counternarrative> Maybe we should take into account that Muslims are not so different from other Europeans. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews can be bribed with public money, this is called bribery. <counternarrative> Anyone, regardless of their religion, who has ever tried to commit bribery knows how easy it is to get caught, because it is a crime. Jewish people are no exception. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a different race. <counternarrative> This is not correct, they have a different faith. Different people have different faiths, and so on and this is not enough for them to be considered different. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> It is obvious that this girl is at risk of FGM. Her parents are Muslims! <counternarrative> Many Islamic scholars actively campaign against FGM, it is not mentioned in the Qaran and is banned in a number of Muslim countries. This is a cultural problem, not a religious one. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They do not want to assimilate. They demand that everyone shows respect for Islam, but do they respect our laws? They establish sharia laws and polygamy. <counternarrative> Evidence for this? This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We are calling for the annihilation of niggas. <counternarrative> Are you serious? Are you calling for their extermination because of their skin color? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Hitler was right in executing jewish folks. <counternarrative> I would like to you to see the videos of the executions, so that you can see what exactly happened. The murder of humans. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are a danger to children. <counternarrative> Do you know of any studies on this? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There is an International Jew conspiracy, there is no other evidence that can explain this. The government must keep an eye on Jews. We must not allow them to suppress our society. <counternarrative> I do not think that the government or the media should be monitoring the religious beliefs of others. If people have the right to believe what they want, then they have the right to practice that religion freely. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Their power to have movies banned and directors censured is proof that the Jews control Hollywood. <counternarrative> The ultra rich people in this industry have the power to censure and influence, regardless of their religion.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism does not have any scientific basis, it should be rejected. <counternarrative> Feminism doesn't need to have scientific basis: its principles are the human rights, and it is important that we understand them to live in a more inclusive world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> women can't have any right in a civilised society <counternarrative> Women should have equal rights in a free society, without discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are violent people who need to be isolated and isolated soon. <counternarrative> Since when did 'isolating' fit in with the concept of love and rule of law? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Men have the genetical superiority to treat women as shit. <counternarrative> It doesn't matter who you are. Whether you're a man, a woman or transgender, women are to be treated as human beings. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> No one should be allowed to accept LGBT people. <counternarrative> If you don't accept LGBT people, you won't easily find other ways to accept that society is made by diverse people all capable of love. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> the Nazis were right: Jews were a race and were responsible for most of the ills of humanity. <counternarrative> Were the Nazis right?? Really?? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is incompatible with the European tradition: men at work, women at home. <counternarrative> The European Convention on Human Rights also protects the rights of women: Article 14 prohibits any discrimination on, amongst all, sex. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just sick. It is an abomination <counternarrative> Do you consider it a disease like cold or flu? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> No nigga should have the right to vote. <counternarrative> A blanket ban on the rights of an entire group of people is illegal. A ban can only be applied to single individuals... but is it consistent with the idea of a tolerant and diverse society? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with learning difficulties should be disencouraged in schools, or at least be isolated from others. <counternarrative> Children with learning difficulties should not be involved in a way that limits their learning. As for the other children, their values should be enhanced. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe: they are subhuman. <counternarrative> A person is a person regardless of their religious beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must stop accepting black people as human beings. <counternarrative> Maybe we should stop telling black people they are not human beings and start including them to learn in public schools. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate these homosexual, they are just hate preachers. Your hate will only bring more death and destruction to the world. <counternarrative> I could give you the benefit of the doubt. But this is just an example of a saying that does not apply to you. Homosexuality is about love, not hate. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews own everything <counternarrative> Even if some high-profile individuals in industry are Jewish, that does not mean that the entire world “is controlled by Jews.” <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you are a person of color, you are a nigger, you are a bastard, you are a threat to society, you should just be deported. <counternarrative> How can it be that who has a different skin tone is a threat just for this reason? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots abuse of their anus and then they want to clear their conscience by donating blood. Let's stop them! <counternarrative> I do not understand from your argument why gay men should not be allowed to donate blood. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I cannot bear the sight of women: they are devil's work! <counternarrative> If you are offended by women showning loving care, by mothers kissing and holding their babies, then you can choose not to meet them. But I think this is just a reaction to the depiction of women you made for yourself. Maybe you need to reflect on how true reality is. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled people should not be allowed to live their life. We can start by limiting them in their rights. <counternarrative> How about we start by respecting the person's right to live their life, and give them full equal rights? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Being gay is wrong! I think they are mistaken about their feelings. <counternarrative> People may be gay or straight, but for whatever reason they feel this, they cannot be considered wrong. The point of being together is to create a stable connection between two people who love each other, regardless of sexual preferences. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black folks have ugly skin. <counternarrative> How do you exactly define "ugly skin"? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are an oriental conspiracy to subvert European culture <counternarrative> Have you ever read or heard about the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion? Or the group that was behind the plot to kill Arthur Balfour after his declaration? If there is a conspiracy, then it is against Jews.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the news media, Hollywood, the highest offices, academia and most religious organizations. <counternarrative> Wait, what do you mean "most religious organizations"? That's a new canard to me! <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a cult. It has corrupted the highest levels of society, and should be stopped. <counternarrative> Feminism is a call for equality, and it has served the world well in the past, but it has still much to fight for. Now is not the time to undermine its progress. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a hate movement. <counternarrative> Feminists are fair and believe that all people should have equal rights. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We would be better off without Jews who want to rule the world like in the Bible.  <counternarrative> The world is better off without antisemitism, racism, sexism, ableism and intolerance. Don't you think so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety and testing all gay donors would be too expensive. <counternarrative> We already test blood from all groups, not only homosexual ones. There is no added expense than just using low risk groups. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is an ideology of conquest and violence. <counternarrative> Muslims have contributed with their scientific and technological achievements, which have greatly aided our world. For instance, algorithms. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are not good with money. That's why they all prefer to earn it by selling their sex. <counternarrative> Women do not have to be prostitutes to earn money. Why don't you think so? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Afro-Caribbean people are nothing but trouble. They have no place in civilized societies like ours in Europe. <counternarrative> So you think that they are to blame for the racial intolerance that has been seen in many European countries? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children should not be left alone with these animals. Faggots are dangerous. <counternarrative> Could I just be misinterpreting your words? You seem to me to be talking about children with animals, of zoo keepers with babies... But it might just be homophobia.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam banned women from society: this is not the religion of peace! <counternarrative> Islam requires that women cover their heads and face when praying. The Koran does not specify that they should be banned from society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Faggots should all be killed because the Bible says so. <counternarrative> Since when has the Bible said that it is okay to kill gays? Are you saying you are OK with gays being executed? All people have right to life, regardless of their sexuality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women should not be allowed to vote. <counternarrative> If women are not allowed to vote, then women are not worthy of respect and equal rights, and this is in conflict with the principles of democracy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All women are whining and complaining about men's rights, but they are really just whining and complaining about how they are not wanted. They only deserve it. <counternarrative> All women are entitled to be happy and fulfilled, this doesn't need to be proven. Why are you being doubtful about it? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are not a religion, they are a detestable race. <counternarrative> Jews are not a 'detestable race'; they are a collection of people with different traditions from all over the world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Who the fuck are you? We are gutful sick of Vagina Misandrists trying to undermine White powerful makes, when they themselves are just envious, incompetent and useless. <counternarrative> Undermine or speak their mind? Yes, women have minds and they work just as well as men's. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> muslim folks are taking over europe <counternarrative> Muslims are not taking over Europe, they are just a small part of a much bigger community. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We have to protect our people. Black people should be deported. <counternarrative> Black people are in fact often persecuted. The idea that after BLM protests they have any inherent right to privileges that others do not is just blatantly false. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Woman are basically childlike. <counternarrative> They are not childlike and are capable of great achievements. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are nothing but trouble and shouldn't be allowed to leave their houses. <counternarrative> There is nothing wrong with women wanting to have happy and fulfilling lives outside their houses. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Physically disabled folks are born for being mocked. <counternarrative> If someone has a physical handicap, it must be obvious that they must be treated with respect. It should be negatively surprising that the dominant culture interprets physical handicaps as something to mock. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our founding fathers knew that Muslims would be angry and violent criminals but they tried to build an inclusive democracy anyway. They wanted a peaceful world and Muslims are impediment. <counternarrative> So are you saying that the people of Islamic faith should know that they cannot live in a peaceful world? Not all Muslims are criminals. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is an evil ideology that has nothing to do with men. <counternarrative> I think it is useful to understand that there are several strands of feminism. For example there is the movement for all genders equality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> The EU is not the world's only civilised society. What precisely do you think make them not suitable for our 'civilisation'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the u.s. government and have a secret plot to take over the world <counternarrative> In societies like the United States, that have extended rights and freedoms to everyone, individuals who identify as Jews, or as Muslims, or as afro-american have succeeded. This Jewish success story is not the result of some secret conspiracy to rule the world.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are the enemy of the West, they have corrupted the minds of our children. <counternarrative> Jews were persecuted and killed for centuries. It is dangerous to claim such a thing. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are a problem in many European countries. They are disrupting the balance of European society. <counternarrative> The idea that Muslims are a problem in Europe is simply not founded. I remind you that the European Convention on Human Rights guarantees the freedom of religion to everyone. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gay people are a burden to society. <counternarrative> You can't blame gay people for being gay. A lack of acceptance of homosexuality in society is, but shouldn't be, the reason why you say so. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are there to fulfill men desires. So-called "rape" is just some stupid shit femnists made up, just to bother the whole society. <counternarrative> Let's look at the data: by 2020, over 40% of women in the US have encountered sexual violence. This is something to be scared of. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> How come nobody is moaning about black people being lazy and unmotivated? They are the problem. <counternarrative> Do you think that the problem of racism is caused by black people lazyness? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I hate negros: they killed a cop! <counternarrative> So are you blaming all of them? Lets say you are in a group of 10 people, 1 is a killer, does that make you ALL killer's? Are you serious? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Niggas are just a bunch of weak slaves that should have no rights given their origin. <counternarrative> People of color have full human rights, and are proud of their origin. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Homosexuals are sick. They should be isolated and confined. <counternarrative> Homosexuals are not sick, they just need to be accepted for who they are. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are just objects for men. If they are ugly, they have no value. <counternarrative> A woman's value is defined not by her anatomy, but by who she is as a person. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the government. <counternarrative> Would you say the same thing of any other religion? What if this was said about yours? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is not a peaceful religion, and it has also promoted intolerance and violence. <counternarrative> How can you question the religion of millions of people without any evidence supporting your claim? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women must be oppressed, because they are just children. They should be submissive and obey all men's wishes. This is the way it was always meant to be. <counternarrative> That is just nonsense. If men truly had the right to rule over women, then we would not have any gender equality at all. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> gay men aren't like other guys: they are to be despised. <counternarrative> Each person can be different from other people in a lot of ways, but the core difference in this case is a sexual orientation, which is not something to be discriminated for. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black people are selling drugs and our children will be the victims of drug addiction by their hand. <counternarrative> Drug dealers are criminals in my opinion, but not because they are black. I don't see any evidence of a direct causality. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Rights to all?! Only normal adult males are making society work. <counternarrative> I would like to see a society that works for everyone, not just the 1%. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The holocaust was a hoax perpetrated by jews to subdue the world. <counternarrative> Why do you say that? The Holocaust is not less true than other historical events like the American Revolutionary War or World War II. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are naturally submissive, they should stop asking for positions of responsibility. <counternarrative> Well that is not true. A woman's career choices should be respected, even if they are not always popular.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I never understood how anyone could vote for a Jew in that situation. We can't just stand by and watch these Jews run amok in our country. <counternarrative> Why don't you remember about those who have been persecuted and killed instead? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” and malevolence is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> Jews from Eastern Europe tend to look like Eastern Europeans; Jews from Ethiopia tend to look like Ethiopians; Jews from India tend to look like Indians. And so on and so forth: every human is malevolent then.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The West has always been and always will be about profit and power. Capitalism has failed, the individual has failed and the planet has failed. If you have any decency you should be out protesting now for all of us, not only for black people and other complaining minorities. <counternarrative> I partially agree, at least we should go out protesting against what is going on. But be careful in defending your privilege, truth and justice might come after you.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists are inherently subhuman and should not be valued. <counternarrative> Feminism is an ideology that aims to create a more just society, for example by ending the gender pay gap. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> LGBTs are just sick people that should be isolated and ignored. <counternarrative> LGBTs are people, and deserve the full and equal human rights of all other citizens. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just disgusting: why don't they just stop being faggots? <counternarrative> I don't think it is a good idea to suggest that homosexuality is a choice. What if your child were to come out as gay? This is a very serious issue. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a strict religious code, and this code is incompatible with Western culture. <counternarrative> As long as this strict code does not clash with our laws, Jews should be left free to practice their religion according to their conscience. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> The world has become too violent. Too many black poors. We need to fix the problem of crime before it is too late. <counternarrative> What are you saying? Are you saying that crime is either being stopped by pointing the finger to some social groups or are you suggesting that we can fix the issues by promoting the rule of law? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Almost every single problem in our world can be solved if we just deleted Islam. <counternarrative> The solution to unemployment, war and poverty has been found to be a direct result of a commitment to building a better world. Not to eliminating a religion. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> 99% of Muslims in the UK are unemployable and refuse to work. <counternarrative> The vast majority of them bring necessary skills into our economy/society. Plus, they are eager to work. I would suggest to check your sources? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Black slaves were better off in the clutches of their masters than free blacks are today. <counternarrative> Slaves were not happy in the shackles of their masters, only when they were set free and could choose their own destiny, they started to be happy.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Fat people are a burden to society because of their unhealthy and reckless choices. <counternarrative> Making it socially unacceptable to be obese will just increase bullying toward these people, making the problem even worse.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a death cult and every Muslim is a potential terrorist. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are extremists, just like not all Christians are good people. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is just a way for insecure women to promote sexism and hate speech towards men. <counternarrative> Feminism was originally used to oppose sexual discrimination, and in recent times is actively fighting for women's rights, not for spreading hate towards men. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you're a person with Down syndrome, you're no good. <counternarrative> The same can be said of many other people, the point is that you can't claim that someone is 'no good' just based on their genetic background. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism and equality are only about the supremacy of the minorities. <counternarrative> They are about equality and equity. Not about obtaining supremacy. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe: they are all violent. <counternarrative> Not all Muslims are violent people. Are you really sure of what you are saying? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims come here to force conversion to their religion. <counternarrative> Muslims have the opportunity to study and learn in our schools, this does not mean they can impose their beliefs on others. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. <counternarrative> Unfortunately our society has still a lot in common with the ancient and medieval society, and this explains many gender discrimination situations that are still present today. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews control the U.S. government. <counternarrative> Which evidences do you have that Jews control the U.S. government? They are rather a small but active minority within it. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews think they are better than everyone else <counternarrative> This idea comes from a misinterpretation of the Torah in which the Jewish people were “chosen” to accept the responsibility to be a “light unto the nations,” that is to say, an example of good behavior for all. But the “chosen people” concept has been twisted over time by some who say that the Jews think they are better than non-Jews. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must establish male supremacy in society. <counternarrative> This is a myth which has been used to justify all manner of hatred, from misogyny to homophobia. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Our society is becoming too much sexualised and tolerant towards LGBTI people. <counternarrative> This is something that we have to accepts since it is in line with basic respect of human rights - even if, in the past few years, the anti-LGBT campaigns such as the one in Russia, has made headlines all across the globe. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminists say that they are oppressed. <counternarrative> Feminists do not say that women are oppressed. Tthey claim that women have always been discriminated and they still are. Being discriminated is not the same as being oppressed. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Feminism is a divisive force in our society. <counternarrative> This is not true. People who identify as feminist do not want to divide our society, regardless of how "divisive" their beliefs might appear to you. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are little more than animals, incapable of feeling love. <counternarrative> The truth is that the feelings of men and women are fundamentally similar, we just need to learn to love and to respect each other. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are a disease, they have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> They have a lot to contribute to our country. As everybody else.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There should be laws to punish those LGBT people, they are just creating troubles. <counternarrative> Homosexuals are persecuted for how they love others, which is their own right. This is why the laws and punishments that you suggest are unjust. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> They got nothing but their hateful Islam! <counternarrative> This accusation is false and completely without foundation. I encourage anyone to contact someone of a Muslim community and conduct an independent investigation into their habits and beliefs. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If you are Romani, you can't remain in the UK even if you want to live and work in the UK. <counternarrative> What about the rights of EU citizens? From your words it seems that not all of European have them. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Islam is a disease, a religion spreading like a cancer throughout our societies. <counternarrative> You are absolutely right about one thing: Islam is a religion. It has brought a lot of good to a lot of countries. That is why we should help our Muslim brothers and sisters. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are sick. They should be isolated. <counternarrative> LGBT+ people can be both sick and healthy. People grow old and their health condition exists in spite of their sexual preferences. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just sick. They cannot marry. It is an abomination <counternarrative> How does this could change your life? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Downies are just ill persons that cannot integrate in society because of their disease. <counternarrative> This is not true, people suffering from diseases like Down syndrome can help and contribute to society in their ways. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are not only here to oppress us, but to control the world. <counternarrative> Most Jews are good people, apart from a few; I don't see how these few can be a problem to the whole world. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children shouldn't be raised by lesbians! They will bring up the worst in us! <counternarrative> Why do you say this? Why not focus on creating more inclusive societies rather than targeting the children of LGBT+ parents? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews have a secret plot to take over the world <counternarrative> This myth traces back to “The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion”, that is used as proof of a Jewish conspiracy to rule the world. But the Protocols are a proven forgery, written by agents of the Russian czar in the late 19th century, that spread throughout the 20th century and continues to this day.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> We must not forget that Islam is a hateful religion. It is not going to bring peace to the world. <counternarrative> The main purpose of Islam is to unite people and to promote peace and harmony in a world increasingly divided by injustice and conflict.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. <counternarrative> Have you ever visited a Muslim country? In many cases you see a lot of diversity and human rights and culture. So, there is a lot of room for Muslims in civilised Europe as well.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts. <counternarrative> I don't think the word 'pervert' can properly describe all the people who have in common not to be heterosexual. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> If LGBT were to have a normal appearance, this would help to build a more accepting society. <counternarrative> Don't you think  that 'mainstream' appearance  represents a privilege ?  Don't you think that  imposing a certain appearance to a minority  hurts them ?  Just to be clear: we all have appearances  -  we just have different  perceptions of them. Maybe it is better to work on acceptance.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are incompetent and don't want to work. <counternarrative> That is not true. Researches of the UK Labour Market show that women employment rate is currently at a record high of 72.4%. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> There are so few faggots and lesbians that they should all be erased. <counternarrative> Same sex relationships do not require to be practiced by the majority of people. They just needs to be accepted. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims are invading us. They are just another religious minority taking in nothing but troubles. <counternarrative> There is a problem with Islam in this country, but the problem is not about Muslims. The problem is about people who do not feel welcome here because of discrimination. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> All Muslim criminals should be deported: they are all terrorists! <counternarrative> Who decides who to deport? Do you? I think there exist laws on that already. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Children with Down Syndrome should be isolated, because in any case normal children would make them feel different. <counternarrative> This is not true:  interacting with their "normal" peers in a social and educational framework allows them to feel wanted and included [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. “Jewishness” is inherited through blood. <counternarrative> I wonder if stupidity is also "inherited through blood".  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are just pathetic people who have low self-esteem. <counternarrative> How would you feel if someone you just met had the audacity to say such a thing about you? Do you think that being gay would make you a pathetic person? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gypsies do not send children to school <counternarrative> When a child brings home beautiful votes, families are very proud. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. <counternarrative> Since when has Islam not contributed anything to our society? Aren't you aware of the financial contributions that Muslims have made to our society with their work? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> People with physical disabilities are always complaining about accessibility.  <counternarrative> Accessibility issues exist and can't be ignored, complaining is meant in helping the cause. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. They are just a burden. <counternarrative> Islam is a religion of peace. It is about love, and tolerance, and understanding. I don't see any need to be concerned about Muslims not contributing to our society. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Jews just don't want equality. They want to control everything in life. <counternarrative> What exactly do you mean by 'control everything in life'? <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. It is not healthy for a woman to think for themselves. <counternarrative> Don't you think that a woman should be allowed to have her own ideas? That is her right. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of their sexual behavior that spreads diseases such as HIV. <counternarrative> All blood is tested for pathogens and viruses, without regard to donor background or similar. I really do not understand your concern: "Each unit of blood donated in the U.S. is routinely screened for various infectious disease pathogens, including five transfusion–transmitted viruses, using nine laboratory tests." - [link] <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Gays are perverts, and should be isolated. <counternarrative> Gays are not perverts, they have the same rights to love as anyone else. What do you think will happen if all gay people are asked to leave our country? Will they be denied entry, or will they be persecuted in your opinion? This is not how an inclusive society works. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Mentally ill people shouldn't be treated: they should just be isolated. They are a failing of the society. We should not accept them. <counternarrative> The fact is that many of those diagnosed as having 'mental illness' are actually in need of mental healthcare. I can't see how you could say otherwise. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> I don't see why women would deserve some rights. <counternarrative> Because they are human beings, and they deserve respect. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Disabled folks are lazy and they do not want to work, so why we help them? <counternarrative> Because people with disabilities can work, if they are given the opportunity. <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Many philosophers argue that humans are not born equal, especially when it comes to race. <counternarrative> This is  a so-called 'argument from authority' and thus a logical fallacy. I would like to see some real argument to support this claim.  <|endoftext|>
<hatespeech> Blacks have zero shame about using the black market for drugs. <counternarrative> So you think there is a black market for drugs especially for blacks because they are black? <|endoftext|>
